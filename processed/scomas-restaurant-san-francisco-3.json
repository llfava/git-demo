LOL Main Course: Halibut with sicilian white beans and mashed potatoes. The Halibut was perfectly cooked but needed a little more salt, the mashed potatoes were delicious, and the sicilian white beans were a bit overcooked. Overall, a B Plate. Dessert: The chocolate brownie with espresso ice cream, whipped cream, and caramel. All 4 of my favorite combined in one dish - cant go wrong with this!  Great place to go if you are visiting the city. The restaurant offers free valet parking and the crowd is a bit older - more sr citizens for sure, LOL. Also, the place has some great views of the Bay!  I heard it gets crowded on the weekends so be ready to wait.",

    "review_text": "After spending nearly 3 weeks in South America - I returned wanting to eat anything EXCEPT meat. \u00a0Seriously, I kid you not, I had steak every single night while in Argentina that I vowed off steaks for the rest of 2008. \u00a0(It's now 2 weeks since I've been back - I still don't want steak!)  So on an evening when we had to pick a place to eat, we decided to hit up this restaurant because their pasta was supposed to be good - and it's a seafood place. \u00a0Anything non-meat is good by me.  Located at Fisherman's Wharf, it runs the risk of being \"for tourists\", and it is. \u00a0But once in awhile, that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, and Scoma was just such an exception.  Their food was good, starting off with the bread and butter. \u00a0The wine selection was nice, and we had a wonderful bottle of Riesling. \u00a0The clam pasta I had (Pasta Scoma) was quite a generous portion and tasty. \u00a0Considering what a fanatic I am about Pasta w/ Clam Sauce, it's hard to impress me but Scoma's dish was not just flavorful but had a WHOPPING amount of fresh clams in it, with every single shell having a plump clam inside. \u00a0(Pet Peeve: \u00a0when people give me shells with no meat inside!)  The cioppino is reportedly outstanding - and it looked good. \u00a0Again, the portions are notable. \u00a0  The location is right by the water, and a bit detached from the main street. \u00a0It's on the fancier side of things - though a dress code is not really enforced. \u00a0The tables are rather close together. \u00a0  This is a great place for a date or even a small business dinner - and prices are reasonable, especially considering its location and intended target. It's actually quite romantic and intimate, but because it's not secluded or private, it can appeal to just about anybody. \u00a0Scoma's has been around a long time, and has a loyal patronage - and after eating here once, I daresay it's well-deserved.  I would eat here again when I am craving fresh seafood, any day of the week!  As a sidenote, we had ordered the seafood platter hoping to gorge on cold seafood and white wine, but the waiter forgot and just served us our main entrees. \u00a0When we mentioned this, he was willing to fix the situation, but having seen the size of the entrees, we decided to skip the appetizer. \u00a0At the end of the meal, he comped us a dessert on the house and packed it for us to take with us. \u00a0Human error, but considering we were glad it didn't come, in hindsight, I thought it was a very kind gesture on his part.  Scoma's - try it!",

The old furnishings, 1960-era wall photos, elderly waiters with photographic memories and reliably tasty chow combine for a nice Wharf evening, a chance to play or be a tourist. Jam in shoulder to shoulder, laugh, drink and order extra bread for your chowder or bisque!

The Caesar Salad was mediocre at best. I don't think salads are a strong suit there in general, so beware.  For our mains, we ordered the Fettuccine with Smoked Salmon and Shrimp... a total disappointment. I had this dish back in 1999, and at that time, the Salmon was HUGE along with the Shrimps. Over time, the Salmon became small strips, and the Shrimps were non-existent and tiny.  I expected the same kinds of amazing dishes that once wow'd me then, but Scoma's was certainly showing it's age, and times have changed. I was incredibly disappointed with my experience.

We had a rsvp for 8:30, car serviced dropped us off at 8:25 and upon walking in, we were greeted with a sea of people hovering around where the reception area would be which I thought could use a little bit more organization but besides the point...proceeded to check in for our reservation and then we had to find a space to stand and wait for our names to be called over the intercom til our table was ready which was a good 15 minutes wait so I suggest getting there about 15 minutes prior to your rsvp, maybe more on a busy night (mind you this was a Monday night rsvp). So the seating promptness for a reservation was sub part at best and at this point I was just hoping for the meal to compensate for that and hopefully live up to the hype....IT DID!!!  The lobster bisque was delish. For my main course I went for the night's mixed grill option of 3 different types of uber fresh fish and jumbo shrimps on a bed of roasted vegetables and a hefty serving of mashed potato seasoned to perfection and a smoked salmon romoulade that was just soooo orgasmic. ..yes I said it.. which also paired really well with the bottle of WillaKenzie Estate pinot noir wine we had.  The serving was definitely hefty and filling that I couldn't even finished the rest of my meal. Overall, the meal definitely is worth the hype. Can't say much for the dessert menu as we never made it that far :)",

The worst thing about this restaurant is that there are NO RESERVATIONS, meaning that it takes forever for you to get seats. Thankfully, there's a full menu outside, and the view was just amazing.  It took an hour to get in. When I first sat down, I was immediately offered water and a bread basket. Bread was just whatever. And then I noticed...A VERY DIRTY SPOON. It wasn't even leftover residue from washing, it was CLEARLY unwashed. Server didn't seem TOO apologetic, just like oh sorry I'll fix it! Got a way cleaner spoon but that was disgusting.  The food came out really fast, and everything was delicious! I ordered a lobster ravioli and it was REALLY GOOD. Great lobster, not too heavy cream sauce, and delish. My date ordered the salmon and shrimp pasta fettucine and fairly enjoyed it.  Ended the night with a white chocolate garibaldi (white chocolate cheesecake tart baked with an oreo bottom) while he had tiramisu. The garibaldi was whatever, but good; his tiramisu was SCRUMPTIOUS. It came in a cup with a CHOCOLATE spoon and a biscotti! So cute!  It was definitely great, and would come here again...maybe just earlier. I can't wait to try all the other delicious dishes--their seafood is definitely fresh and amazing (:",

The food here is solid! I loved the lobster bisque! So rich and creamy plus a bit of lobster pieces. This was my favorite part of my meal here! I ordered the rock shrimp and smoked salmon fettuccine. The shrimp and smoked salmon were cooked just right. Not overcooked at all. My only gripe with this dish was the over abundance of red onions! I like red onions, and a healthy addition of finely chopped pieces would be ok. Unfortunately, they put large slices that were overwhelming. Everyone else in my party was happy with their orders.  Seating here is kind of tight. The service was just ok. The host and our server lacked personality and enthusiastic service. Overall, good food and nice views. I definitely recommend to remedy those seafood cravings!",

For dessert I chose the pumpkin cheesecake. It was soooo good.   My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque, ahi tuna and a dessert duo of tiramisu and bread pudding. The lobster bisque was the best I've ever had and same with the bread pudding!  I'm very picky when eating seafood and if it tastes at all fishy then I refuse to eat it. This was not a problem at Scoma's. Everything tasted fantastic! The food is a bit pricey (hence why we did the three course special) but the food is worth it.",

My girl friends and I came for Dine About Town a few days ago because $35.95 for a three-course dinner seemed like a steal in light of entrees costing that much alone here.   I chose the dungeness crab cakes, the lamb T-bones with parmesan polenta, and the pumpkin cheesecake. Nothing was bad, but everything was bland. For example, the crab cakes could have benefited from a curry or garlic aioli; the lamb would have been tastier with a balsamic vinegar glaze; the cheesecake should have had a thicker graham cracker crust. Dinner didn't appear to be a deal after I tasted the food.  I was also peeved that the host promised us a 40-minute wait (Scoma's doesn't take reservations), which actually turned into a 1-hour 10-minute wait. It's always better to estimate liberally. If I knew we had to wait that long, I would've just dined at another restaurant.   The view IS easy on the eyes, though. \u00a0  Scoma's is yet another old, semi-stuffy restaurant that makes you wonder how it's still surviving and thriving in a city with over 4,500 restaurants, many of them serving delicious food at reasonable prices.

We also ordered a bottle of Reisling, Saint M, which was priced well at $32. We got a cup of creamy clam chowder with a lot of clam pieces. Then all three of us ordered the pasta Garibaldi, which was sooo rich in flavor, once again no skimp on the fish. I swear each of us had over 30 small scallops, mussels and salmon pieces. That was the highlight of our meal and we all agreed the best main course in our 3 day trip. The dessert was a chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sauce. My family said it was really good, sadly I didn't have a bite being I'm allergic to chocolate, but I'm sure it was good. My daughter had the chicken tenders on the kids menu which she ate and she is very picky how certain restaurants season their chicken tenders. After leaving my daughter said she forgot her bag full of candy she had purchased in her chair. She was worried that someone already picked up her bag, We went back and the hostesses were sweet and said they had her bag and joked with her that they were about to eat the peeps if she hadn't returned.

Our table had a nice view of the marina and we got started. Our server was a bit \"tipsy\" but all was good. I had the grilled cod which was good and my aunt and uncle had the swordfish which was delicious!! I didn't want dessert but they did and they got the apple crisp a la mode. They said it didn't taste that good and it looked mushy, a look a bit unappetizing. The food was reasonably priced. Just wish the dessert was better, but will go back, just not for dessert. :)",

I might have been willing to be clawed by Oscar (my name for my crustacean) to taste his delectable pinchers, though that would have made it difficult to crack the shell. I was willing to sacrifice my cholesterol reading to dip my legs (rather, his) into the melted butter.  Very old-school waiter in dress and manner provided exquisite service, especially for such a casual place. And I thought the place would be over-run by tourists. Certainly the majority were, but not the \"overrunning types.\" This might be because the place is a block toward the bay from Beach Street. I only found it through Yelp. Great public transportation nearby, including the classic, antique streetcars that go to the Ferry Building.  Beautiful location, on a dock right on the bay, with what look like fishing boats on the dock (not many of these left on the piers anymore). A perfect, final meal before I left the city.",

Bread and breadsticks were brought to our table and I must note, that although I did not fill up on it, they gave a nice big portion of bread cut into thick slices. Umm, BONUS POINTS! I hate when restaurants give you a ration of bread that barely feeds the pigeons outside and you have to flag down a server for more. Not at Scoma's!    But on to the food.....I ordered the pasta diplomatica which had petite lobster tails, scallops, clams, and prawns in a creme sauce. My friend had something that came with some scrumptious mashed potatoes, steamed veggies, and prawns that were the size of my face! Ok, not that big but they were literally the size of my entire palm...which is still damn big! My pasta had a very generous portion of fresh seafood. The scallops were large and amazing! I had no complaints.  The service was great. Probably one of the best I have had in a long time. They were attentive without being bothersome....that is skill, seriously. Kudos to them!  If you are looking for some new, inventive, knocks you to the floor seafood, I wouldn't say that Scoma's does that.

It was flavorless meat - hardly any substance or actual enjoyment to it.  I had lobster - and I'm really not that impressed. I believe it was overcooked - dry, and overpowering with seasonings. The crab stuff mushroom was not the best either.  The vegetables were bland, and the rice was dry and overcooked. I know what rice tastes like - as I tend to eat it everyday, and their rice is a place I would expect from something of a fast casual restaurant, not here.  Maybe it's because I'm a native of Seattle Seafood, or that I cook seafood myself - but I'm really not pleased with this restaurant and it's service and the quality of the food that was served given the prices listed.

    "review_text": "I came with some friends for Dine About Town on a Sunday at 7:15 PM. We were seated at around 8:10, but we didn't start getting food until 9:05, which was a bit disappointing. I know it was busy, but it took nearly 25 minutes for the waiter to finally get down our order. Now onto the food:  Appetizer: Lobster Bisque - This bisque was delicious and packed a lot of flavor without being too much. I've had lots of bisques in the past that were very salty, but this was a good balance. It also had a bit of a spicy kick at the end of every bite.  Clam Chowder - This was not your typical clam chowder to say the least... I personally felt it lacked flavor. My friend described it as chicken noodle soup-esque and I have to agree. It was a bland chicken noodle soup with cream and clams instead of chicken.  Entrees: Seared Scallops over Linguine - I only had a taste of the scallops, so I can't comment on the pasta. The scallops were nicely cooked, had a good texture but it lacked the sweetness that I usually expect from them.  Lamb T-Bones - This was definitely the highlight of the evening for me. I asked for my lamb to be medium rare, and out come 3 good looking pieces of lamb. One of the pieces was a perfect medium, while the other 2 were perfect medium-rares - weird. it was seasoned well and the lamb was soft and amazing. the juices of the lamb seeped into the spinach and that was incredible as well.  Dessert: Tiramasu and Sourdough Breading Pudding - I love bread pudding, but I'm probably not going to order a sourdough one again. The raisins tasted sour after the caramel on top of the sourdough. That's just too much sour for me in a bread pudding. The tiramasu was great though. The coffee flavor had a little, but just enough sweetness to make this good for a fan of bittersweet things.  tl;dr - the wait was long, the portions are huge, would only come back for the bisque and lamb",

It is not just the quantity but the outstanding quality of their seafood. The restaurant is always crowded, but they have a bar where you can wait and a highly efficient staff that seats you as promptly as possible. The food was delicious. I recommend the Cioppino which is a fisherman's stew of seafood invented in San Francisco by the Italian fisherman some years ago. The ravoili was delicious as well and portions are very large. The seafood is very fresh. Highly recommended.",

My crab cakes could have been cooked better. It wasn't as crispy as I'd like it to be. But the person who made this place a good experience was the older gentleman asian buss boy. He was very polite and attentive, always refilling my ice tea and checking up on us. Our server was pretty absent. I was upset because it took more than 5 minutes for him to even come over and greet us. He seriously took our order and took our credit card. The buss boy deserved the $5 tip I slipped to him secretly.   I'd come back but just beware the service may be hit or miss depending on if you look like you'd leave a good tip or not. Obviously our server made a major mistake. I'm a working woman mister!",

There was no gloss to it as there should be with meat when cooked to order. We also ordered the seared ahi, which was just okay. It was too done and not satisfying, but tasted better than the pork. Last, dessert.  We got the tiramisu and the sorbet. The tiramisu was in this tiny espresso cup!!! Literally a few bites of this. Dissapointed.

    "review_text": "I can't figure out all the great reviews for this place. \u00a0The last time I had a great meal here was around 1975.  30 plus years ago this place was the bomb. \u00a0Now it's just a tourist trap.  The prices are outrageous for the quality of food that they serve.  In the 70's it was great, kind of a dive that few knew about with great food at a good price. \u00a0I ate there quite a bit then especially when out of town relatives showed up.  Around 1998 I tried it again after not having been there for quite a few years. \u00a0I remember I was sorely disappointed, high prices, dry fish, and everything a la carte. \u00a0I remember nothing came with my entree.  Fast forward to present day and my niece and her husband who moved here 3 years ago now say they love it and have been there 5 times already. \u00a0I agree to give it another try since my sister is here from Chicago and is open to it too.   We had to wait about 45 minutes, the place was pretty full, so I thought maybe everyone else knew something I did not.  Once we got seated and I perused the menu I was even more shocked by the prices. \u00a0Art least they do now include sides with some of the entrees. \u00a0I still could not bear to order some of these entrees at 30 dollars and up even though my sister was paying. \u00a0I decided to opt for a shrimp and crab open face sandwich at $17 figuring it might be pretty good since it's hard to ruin something like that.  My niece ordered an appetizer of mozzarella in a spicy tomato sauce which I tried. \u00a0Nothing to write home about, the sauce was OK but I thought a pretty small portion for the price.  My sandwich arrived with fries and a salad. \u00a0Salad was lettuce with 1000 island dressing and a few beets on the side. I've had better at a diner. \u00a0Fries were hot but nothing special. \u00a0The sandwich was on a huge thick piece of toasted sourdough. \u00a0The only thing on it was mayo and the shrimp was on one side, the crab on the other. \u00a0The only way to eat it was with a knife and fork. \u00a0The bread was so hard I almost asked for a steak knife to cut it as I had to saw and saw to get through it with a regular knife. \u00a0The shrimp was OK, a \u00a0little seasoning might have helped. \u00a0By the time I got to the crab, I gave up on eating the bread and ate just the crab. It was watery and tasteless except for salt. \u00a0Yuck!  With all the wonderful seafood restaurants in SF, this place should be at the bottom of the list.  I much prefer Pacific Cafe and for crab you can't beat Thanh Long.  We had a wonderful meal at Chapeau's the night before so maybe it was the memory of the delicious halibut I had there that helped to disappoint me here.  But I have vowed, never again will I go to Scoma's, I don't care who's in town.",

Though they are on the water, there didn't appear to be an outdoor seating area so the view tends to be more of the restaurant itself and the small marina than the bay itself. When you enter, it really appears that Scoma's will be outrageously expensive from the decor and waitstaff's outfits, but it is really quite reasonable, especially compared to the tourist traps nearby. We visited, hoping mostly for a gorgeous bay view, and were disappointed in that regard, but very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The view is fine, but not stunning as we had hoped. After sitting, I was afraid it would be classic, \"old people\" food, but it really turned out to be quite unique with an inspired menu of classic seafood dishes and some new spins on them as well. We had the crab louie salad, which was mush less what you would think of as crab salad, and more of an actual salad covered in huge mounds of tender local crab, as well as the crab spoonbread which was like a delectable shepherd's pie of crab. I'm so glad we both got crab as it was absolutely incredible there. You could tell it was amazingly fresh, probably off the boat that morning. All in all, it was a great place to eat. Though probably 90% of their clientele are tourists, they manage to make it feel like your are one of their regulars.",

We all tried the soups - Lobster Bisque and Scoma's Famous Clam Chowder - it delivered a smile. So we missed trying the sides like Sauteed Mushroom and Creamed Spinach, but that is what you get for drinking the wine too fast... for sure next time. This is where experience kicks in, like knowing to drive up in front for free parking...missed that too. Wine was outstanding, at the suggestion of a noteworthy waiter - Tony.

We finally were able to make the trip here this weekend for my our 4 year anniversary. Hehe. :) We came here for lunch after an Alcatraz tour. I like how the restaurant is located away from all the craziness on Jefferson St. Makes the dining experience a bit more relaxing.   My boyfriend ordered the cracked whole Dungeness crab, clam chowder and a Cesar salad. I ordered the lobster ravioli. Lobster ravioli was delicious. Even though there were only about 7 pieces of ravioli, they were about twice the size of other raviolis at other restaurants. It was creamy, not too heavy and even came with a piece of the lobster tail. At first, I thought it was just for decorations, but the tail still had delicious and fresh meat attached to it. The clam chowder and Cesar salad were also very delicious and flavorful. Definitely not your usual soup and salad that tastes like it was just thrown together with not much effort in making it different. I wish I had good taste buds to be able to pick out what made it different. But just know that I think you won't be disappointed! I think the best part of this meal though, is the crab! It was a good size crab, served chilled and had so much meat in it! It seemed like my boyfriend kept pulling good size pieces of meat out of each leg. I love crab and have always had it at Chinese restaurants. Those crabs don't compare to this one! Didn't even need to add any sauces or lemons.   Service was also great. Very attentive, friendly and quick, but we did eat at a slower time. However, I definitely will come here again the next time I'm in town. Nothing like eating fresh seafood at the pier in San Francisco. :)",

Ordered the roasted crab with garlic, olive oil and lemon.   Did I mention garlic?   Yeaaaaaah. Finger. Lickin. Good.   This is a dish you better have some time to enjoy; your companions are likely to be done with their meals before you. That's ok. Let'em stare. By the time I was done, I was covered up to my wrists in stuff, and I do NOT like to touch my food. I had crab, garlic, olive oil, lemon and parsley all over my hands like mittens, and I didn't mind one bit.   The crab was meaty and delicious, but the garlic? It does a body good!",

    "review_text": "Recommended by friend during recent trip up to SF.   Overall quality of the seafood was fairly good. (8/10) However overall value of food factoring in costs is only average (5/10). We spent over $200.00 for a lunch for four and only two people had adult beverages, so we tried to get the good stuff. However, I've had comparable meals if not better for a fraction of the cost.  In terms of ambience, location is off the water on Pier 47. Location in proximaty to water is nice, but the water was green, and the furniture was a little beat up.   The service kept our water cups and bread baskets full and checked in on us periodically. However, considering their prices, they better be asking me if I need more water to swallow this food.  The misses had the Lazy Cioppino, which I recommend as a good size bowl of seafood. It's really a good size meal, and probably not the best choice of my petite honey as she could only eat half the stuff. Scallops were tender and the ingredients tasted fresh. (Yah, guess who tried to eat the other half...)  I had the salmon with lobster ravioli. Salmon practicalled melted in my mouth. Only four raviloi, so I wanted more.  The blood marys are above average, but not as good as say Mimi's Cafe. They cut a small piece of celery stalk and they don't even coat the rim of your glass with salt or spices. Not worth $8.50, IMO.  I'd probably only give this place 3.5 stars mainly because as a relative value I feel there's better places out there.",

I hated the idea of taking them up near Fisherman's Wharf, but had too many locals who have been here way longer than I say its the best place to go. I can completely agree with them.

We chose the restaurant based on Yelp reviews and boy were we happy with our research results! The pacific oysters were INSANE! So incredibly fresh and delicious! Best oysters I've ever had! Decadent Swordfish Con Fagioli and wine! The service was fantastic even though we weren't dressed up. I felt like we fit in.

I was so grateful that I opted for a bowl rather than a cup because I would have been super sad with a smaller serving. The delicious broth was filled with large, tender pieces of clam. I've never had another clam chowder like it. I don't think I ever will, unless I'm back at Scoma's.  Man cannot live on chowder alone so we also ordered an appetizer that consisted of shrimp dusted in cornmeal and lightly fried. Pretty good, definitely fresh, but not up there with the chowder.   The restaurant is definitely on the hilarious side of outdated but I think they are looking to retain some of their old school charm, and that's fine by me. Since I'm not sure if anything else could live up to the chowder I might just keep this spot as a light lunch destination while in San Francisco.",

    "review_text": "Went here Sunday night for DAT. People aren't kidding about the long wait! We had to bum around for an hour or so before our seats were called, so definitely think about the waiting time if you want to dine here.  Once called, we were seated in a comfy booth and introduced to our waiter, Chris. Honestly, Chris is one of the reasons I'm a fan of this place- he has a friendly, grandfatherly air and will always keep you up-to-date on the status of your food &amp; service. He even managed to help us substitute a DAT entree (this is HUGE) for one of my vegetarian friends.  But anyways, the food. Like most restaurants, Scoma gave us a basket of bread &amp; breadsticks. I wasn't a huge fan of the bread, since I've never liked sourdough, but I guess that's more of an industrywide thing, so nothing you can do.  For the appetizer/\"first\" course, my friend Alan &amp; I ordered the lobster bisque. As expected, it was very rich &amp; creamy, though a tad salty, in my opinion. My friend's clam chowder, on the other hand, was delicious! Typically, I don't like clam chowder, but this was an exception! Although that might be because the clam chowder reminded me of a creamier version of chicken noodle soup. As Alan pointed out, the chowder wasn't very \"clam-y\", even though there WERE chunks of clam floating about the vegetables. Regardless, I loved it.  For the second course, I ordered scallops and linguini pomodora. The linguini was all right, not stellar, but the scallops more than made up for that. They were buttery and delicious, with a slight bit of crispiness. Ahh, so good! About halfway through the second entree, I felt completely stuffed and had to stop eating. Perhaps it was the clam chowder I consumed, or perhaps it was the generous portions we were given- either way, I literally had to get up and walk around the restaurant before I could go back and eat.  I also tried a bite of Alan's lamb chops, which were delicious &amp; savory. Funny enough, the spinach was also completely infused with a smoky, lamb flavor, which really made the dish unique.  We finished up the meal with various desserts. I got the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake, which was less cheesy than the usual cheesecake I was accustomed too, but delicious nonetheless. I especially loved the bottom layer of the cheesecake, which was a chocolately crumble with a hint of mint. Mm!  My only complaint: there was a waitress (Irene), who had a completely DGAF mindset. While pouring water or grinding pepper, she spilled half of what she was doing, didn't seem to notice, and just went along her way. A bit annoying, especially when some sauces from dishes she was sweeping off the table dripped onto my Android. Sigh.  But the bottomline- this was a delicious restaurant that I would love to come back and try again! Especially the desserts. I'm still unsure whether or not the dinner was really worth $40, so the jury's still out on the success of this DAT meal.",

The clam chouder was reported as good but not spectacular.   When our main dishes came I think everyone was a little let down except me and my friend with the ravioli. \u00a0The halibut was lacking flavor, the deep fried special tasted only of deep fried flavor and the prawns and scallops were good but, again nothing special.

Includes a small pile of greens and balsamic dressing. \u00a0Simple and satisfying!  *Romaine Crab Salad - Essentially a whole head of romain, julienne beets, a pile of dungeness, blue cheese, and a light balsamic vinegarette. This guy is a meal in itself  *Crab Cakes - Three cakes of solid dungeness! No filler in these guys. Crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside!   *Fresh Fish - We each ordered a different fish and they were all OH SO FRESH! served with a generous serving of pasta and vegetables...Simply delicious.  I guess theres a reason why this place has been around for so long. They're food is without a doubt excellent! Expect to be set back $25-$30 a dish, but its well worth the highquality and great service. Lunch would be a more economical alternative.   Sadly we had no room for dessert.",

    "review_text": "2.5 STARS   WELCOME TO TOURONVILLE!  Touronville is where you will find a flock of homogeneous tourons. You know...the khaki, socks with Birkenstocks, and fanny-pack wearing tourists who naively wear their $1k DSLR camera around freely like a puka shell necklace. Like a moron, they overpay for a mediocre meal that ends up hurting more than having your wrists cuffed to your ankles.   Sadly, I was THAT touron last night...  I've heard great things about Scoma's being this great \"SF Institution\" serving superb seafood. Well that may have been the case 40 years ago when their only competition was Sizzler's, Lyons, or Auntie Flo's diner (my lame assumption at least) but today it's more like an SF retribution.   Craving sashimi, I ordered the closest thing to it on the menu, the Sea Whistle Smoked Salmon Plate. For $19, I got a $5.99 three ounce pack of grocery store quality smoked salmon that had been laid out on a plate to air dry like a Downy detergent commercial with red onions, capers, solidified cream friache, and sliced toasted baguettes. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEpBbf_qNfWuz_GBkwCjw?select=tOxNhmV_ulIJAZrCXleA3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEp\u2026</a> Don't worry Costco, Scoma's got nothing on you.   For my entree, I chose the highly acclaimed $37 Lazy Man's Ciopinno. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEpBbf_qNfWuz_GBkwCjw?select=nF3o9GaR4HGq66eNF4zffA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jqEp\u2026</a> After having a the most phenomenal bowl of ciopinno from Anchor Oyster Bar on Monday (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZDvIMjJ-7I0561ckM4pAeA?select=LTriXoXcFiSWY6eWFdqGqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZDvI\u2026</a>), I was sorely disappointed when a pho sized bowl of Campbell's tomato soup was laid before me. It was like going from an artisan cup of coffee from Philz to Sh*tbucks coffee. The cioppino was more like a fish stew and a poor one at that. The fish was noticeably \"fishy\" and there were just 2 clams, 4 scallops, 4 tiger prawns, crab lint and a plethora of bay shrimp suffering from Napoleon complex. With the exception of the scallops, everything was overcooked. The tomato broth was too thick and tasted like diluted Hunt's tomato paste yearning for fresh herbs (garnishing with herbs does not count) and garlic to rejuvenate it from its lonely canned shelf life.   Service was equally as unremarkable as the food. Our brusque waiter was MIA the entire night catering to the whims and wants of the obvious tourons trying to get the non-existent San Francisco treat at Scoma's.  Sitting in the outdated restaurant surrounded by 70s-80s sports memorabilia and a adorable congregation of those casting to be on Grumpy Old Men Part Deux made me feel like young cub as opposed to the usual cougar that sticks out like a sore thumb in a nightclub.  The best part of the meal was the FREE valet parking...now that IS a San Francisco treat! *Woot Woot*",

Maybe I am emotionally attached, but then again it tastes better than I remember every single time we go.   A trip to Nor Cal is never complete without visiting Scoma's, and I recommend it to anyone that is in the area. Sure the prices are a bit high, but to me, it's worth it.  We have never had anything short of great service and always at least get the clam chowder and calamari, both my favorite I've ever tasted. We always leave completely stuffed, because none of us ever want to stop eating the deliciousness. I also often crave their melt-in-you-mouth sourdough bread and butter.

They had a good prix-fixe menu for $40 that included appetizer, entree, and dessert, which I thought was pretty affordable for a seafood restaurant. \u00a0A couple people got the lobster bisque, while the rest of us got the crabcakes. \u00a0I gotta say they definitely had one of the better crabcakes I've had (sorry hubby, just *slightly* better than yours).  For the main course, I got the seared scallops. \u00a0They were pretty good and well seasoned, though I gotta say it seemed a little rubbery to me and I've had better scallops elsewhere. \u00a0Loved the swiss chard though, definitely one of my new favorite veggies. \u00a0The portion size would probably be considered small by some (3 scallops) but I didn't mind since we had appetizer and dessert, and I wanted to eat something light. \u00a0A couple of people got the \"Lazy Man's Cioppino\", which they loved. \u00a0It was $3 more than the regular Cioppino but it saved them the trouble of opening up the crab in a bowl of hot soup. \u00a0  Only 3 out of the 5 of us ordered the prix-fixe, but 3 desserts were more than enough for everybody. \u00a0We had a couple of the brownies and the pumpkin cheesecake. \u00a0Nothing to write home about, but they satisfied our sweet craving at the end of the meal.  We had a fantastic deal on our wine. \u00a0We had a bottle of the Stag's Leap Wine Cellars \"Arcadia\" Chardonnay, and it was a total steal at $42 for the bottle. \u00a0Either it was a pricing error or they must have gotten a nice deal from the winery. \u00a0I'm not normally a white wine person, but it was a great match for all the seafood that we ordered.  I like the ambiance, it was nice being right on the water, though it's probably even better during the day. \u00a0This place has an old school look to it, which is cool for the location. \u00a0The service was really good as well. \u00a0Their prix-fixe \"Triple Play\" menu is definitely a great deal (much better than most DAT menus I've had at $35). \u00a0Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice seafood restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf",

    "review_text": "It is somehow fitting that although I've used Yelp for a while, my visit to this restaurant finally motivated me to write my first substantive review.  Some context: I've been to San Francisco many times for business and had always looked forward to finally being able to visit with my family. This was that opportunity. As we traveled from our hometown of Vegas for a week-long vacation in the Bay Area, I expressed my enthusiasm to the kids about the great food we'd be enjoying in one of my favorite foodie cities.   After checking into our hotel (Argonaut) at the end of Fisherman's Wharf, we hit the pavement in search of dinner. A quick look at Yelp led us down a sketchy alley near our hotel to the favorably-reviewed Scoma's.   I thought it a good omen when I was informed by the hostess that they didn't take reservations, since I assumed that meant our wait time would be reasonable. After being given a wait time estimate of 25-30 minutes (it was a Monday night), our family waited outside by the wharf, listening to the seals and watching meandering boats.   After about 40 minutes I went in to check on the status of our wait time, and from the look on the hostess' face I knew that somehow she'd forgotten/skipped us. She looked like a deer in the headlights and told me there were just a few more parties ahead of us. (My wife later told me that she'd seen people who arrived after us get seated before us. I don't typically notice these types of things, but if I'd known that at the time I would have made an issue of it.)  Finally, after an hour long wait (there's nothing like blown expectations), our hungry family of four were seated, ordered our food, and...were underwhelmed.   We eat out. A lot. I'm proud of the fact that my young kids have sophisticated palettes and that they're discerning but not pretentious. They've also been instilled with an expectation that there's something to enjoy in every meal, regardless of its cost, location, or name on the menu.   Which is why it was disheartening to see my under-10 daughter, who loves salmon, only eat about a quarter of her salmon and lobster ravioli because the sauce \"overpowered\" the natural tastiness of the fish (although she loved the lobster ravioli). I also watched as my just-became-a-teen son was first given a salmon with vodka-infused pasta before our waiter returned five minutes later with the correct order (salmon, assorted veggies, and mashed potatoes). Fortunately, his dish had not been touched. Unfortunately, that was because he, my wife, and I were still waiting for my daughter to receive her food.   My wife selected the pre-fixe menu and had chosen an ahi tuna dish for her entree. While she thought the tuna was okay (medium rare) she didn't like the contrasting taste of the tomatoes with which it was served. She also had the Golden Gate cocktail (I think that's what it was called) and said it was just \"alright\".   And of course, being at a seafood restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf, I ordered the 12 oz. filet mignon. It wasn't as bad as a steak ordered at IHOP (a mistake that my son can attest to), but having enjoyed a great steak the night before, in Mammoth Lakes, the one from Scoma's was not worth the $48.   Lest you think me a perpetual downer, there were some bright spots (actually, they weren't that big, so maybe bright pin pricks might be more apropos): the clam chowder was nice, my wife enjoyed her crab cake appetizer, and one of the desserts we tried (the raspberry cheesecake) had a nice texture/taste to it.   So, in summary, this is what I learned:  - I make terrible decisions when I'm hungry (we should have left when I realized the hostess had somehow missed us on the wait list).   - I know what a disappointing $280 meal tastes like (including tip, family of two adults, two kids).   - Never chase a great rib-eye from a resort ski town with a filet mignon from a seafood joint on Fisherman's Wharf.   - Writing is cathartic, and Scoma's required a lot of catharsis. \u00a0  In summary, you may have learned:  - Sketchy alleys do not always lead to happy endings.",

The cioppino has so much shellfish and seafood that it is difficult to finish unless you have a huge appetite. The lobster is the best I have ever tasted, and it is available served at least three different ways each night. Crab perfect, chowders loaded with clams, etc. Warm fresh bread and a variety of salads compliment probably the best dinners available in the Fisherman's Wharf area.   Located a bit off the main drag of wharf shops on Al Scoma Way, this restaurant brings back the memories of what the waterfront use to be like. Great service, nice bar, quality food, in a very clean environment. Wait staff has been nothing short of perfect on every visit. Plenty of small tables in the bar to relax if you do have to wait for dinner seating.  I have also had lunch/dinner at most wharf restaurants and while many of the menus have been adjusted to the tourist crowd and are somewhat disappointing, Scoma's maintains the quality and atmosphere that you should expect of a higher end restaurant along the waterfront. They don't cut corners. Valet parking is available at the front of the restaurant, and by donation.   I usually call in about 30 minutes before arrival to check on wait times and never have had to wait more than 10 minutes on weekends, no wait ever on weekdays. The atmosphere is nice enough for any occasion and the bar serves up a long list of quality wines, as well as your favorite cocktails.",

We were given waters and bread with our menus. Now. I know this is a seafood restaurant. But for some reasoned both had a hankering for steak! I had the filet mignon and he had the Cowboy Steak. What I loved about this was that I asked for medium rare, and that's exactly what I got. It's very rare for me to order a medium rare steak and to actually get it. We also ordered soup; clam chowder for me (delicious) and lobster bisque for him (also not bad at all). All in all, I had a really good experience here and would definitely come back soon.",

Anyway, we get to Scoma's and they tell us it would be about 45min-hour wait, nothing we didn't foresee. \u00a0They tell us there is complimentary valet, if thats helpful. \u00a0Dunce caps on, we decided to trek back in the cold to put more money in the meter. \u00a0Halfway back to Scoma's I say to boytoy: \u00a0\"What was it they said about valet?\" \u00a0\"What? I can't hear you.\" (Dunce cap too long, covered his ears) \"Nevermind.\" (As I readjusted my dunce cap)  Appetizers: Lobster Bisque w/Lobster salad: Meh, bland city. \u00a0Dungeness Crab Cakes: \u00a0Yummo. \u00a0Can't complain. Main Course: Char Broiled Ahi: Slammin. Lamb T-Bones with Parmesan Polenta: Lamb had to be sent back to be \"cooked\" - Apparently, they forgot that part. Dessert: Ok....here's where it gets tricky. \u00a0While we were looking over the dessert choices, the man dining in the table next to us overhears our sweet dilemma: \"We had bread pudding earlier at Luna Park..do we want to have bread pudding again here?\" Man to be named Mitch later says: If you don't get the bread pudding here you're crazy.\" (totally not verbatim but it went something like that) \u00a0He goes on to say its the best bread pudding he's ever had, he's a regular customer, joke here, joke there, insert laughter here and there...and by the time you know it Mitch and Boytoy are having a bromance and I'm doing cartwheels in front of them trying to get their attention. \u00a0Anyway, eventually Mitch calls it a nite, says goodbye to us both and tells us to enjoy the rest of our nite and weekend, etc. \u00a0   We were ready with our dessert choices when our waitress came up to us, \u00a0and surprisingly says, \"Mitch, the man who was dining next to you has graciously paid for your dessert- the bread pudding.\" \u00a0GET.OUTTA.TOWN! \u00a0We were blushing. \u00a0Well, I was. \u00a0She then goes on to say that we STILL have 2 more desserts to pick on top of that, since Mitch's was extra. \u00a0Oh, shit. \u00a0Boytoy decides to \"pass it forward\" and \u00a0compliment his newfound bromance by offering one of our other desserts to a couple at a table nearby. \u00a0In the end, we took home a walnut brownie minus the ice cream. \u00a0Oh- and the bread pudding? \u00a0No joke. \u00a0Mitch was right. \u00a0Best bread pudding I have ever had.  Overall experience, 3.5 and rounding up.  Mitch, if you're reading this- thank you. \u00a0You made our nite :)",

The sampler appetizer for two is excellent with a small crab cake, calamari and shrimp scampi which was like shrimp in cioppino broth. Nice mix.

Delicious.  For an entree, I ordered the Ahi Tuna topped with a butter-soy sauce-- it was a little overcooked (but I like mine RARE). It was delicious.

The Shrimp and Crab Louis Salad has the Louis (Thousand Island) dressing over a generous portion of Bay Shrimp and Dungeness Crab Meat (no shells to peel or pick at here!) on top of a bed of lettuce with beets, and other garnishment. \u00a0This is the lunch sized portion, not to be confused with the full dinner entree portion which costs over $30. \u00a0But, make no mistakes here, I'd assumed it would be a small portion, it's actually a very fair and fulfilling portion, that is perfect, it's big enough as an entree to get you filled.

Located in Fisherman's Wharf, but a little bit off the beaten path. \u00a0They have a few parking spaces but also have valet. \u00a0  The bar/waiting area is ample. \u00a0I give the chocolate martini 2 thumbs up! \u00a0When our name was called for the table, the host graciously took my drink for me and carried it to the table. \u00a0Very nice touch.  The restaurant is divided into smaller rooms, each room has about 3-4 tables. \u00a0Perfect to keep the noise volume at a minimum when dining, and to also ensure that the servers aren't taking care of too many tables at once. \u00a0 Genius, in my opinion.  Calamari, scrumptious.  My Dungeoness Crab Salad was absolute heaven. \u00a0A mile-high solid mound of fresh crab-- It was $30 but you really do get your money's worth. \u00a0(Except for the extra $4 they charged me for avocado on my salad). \u00a0They serve very generous portions, so don't be startled by the relatively high menu prices.

I followed the advice from the iPhone Yelp app and it brought me to this restaurant with 400+ review and a solid 4 star.   I decided to go full tourist style and went with the prix-fixe lunch menu. What could one possibly get from a $23.95 lunch at a tourist district?  Starter  Cup of Clam Chowder - (5/5 stars) - Their chowder completely blew my mind. I only found out later that Newsweek had named Scoma as one of the five best chowders in the US. While I can't totally agree with that claim, the chowder is still definitely one of the better ones. Solid 5 star quality.  Entree Scallops with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Mixed Vegetables - (3/5 stars) - A bit disappointed by this. The scallops were flavorful but was a bit too salty and over cooked. I have had better scallops elsewhere.   Dessert  Chocolate Mousse Cake - (4/5 stars) - I usually dislike chocolate cakes but I was managed to finished my dessert. The cake was rich in taste yet light in texture. The strawberry puree paired well with the dark chocolate flavor.  I also managed to 'sample' the other entree. Petite Dungeness Crab Salad - (4/5 stars) - Nothing petite about this salad. There were tons of crab meats. The meat was very fresh. Yummy salad dressing.  Great quality food for only $23.95? I have possibly paid close to that for lunch at some mediocre restaurants in south bay.  I am very tempted to try their cioppino that everyone was raving about.

Bowl of clam chowder was also amazing paired with the warm and fresh sourdough bread. Tried my husbands Lobster Bisque and was also amazing. As my main dish I ordered the Fried Combo Platter - Shrimp, Scallops, and Pollock - this dish was good but not fantastic. Wish I would have ordered something more interesting. Nice list of wines to choose from.",

The food was okay. \u00a0Certainly overpriced. \u00a0And certainly nothing special. \u00a0I have been in SF for a few days now and all of the menus from every restaurant by the wharf are kind of running together. \u00a0Nothing particularly stood out at Scoma's.

Make sure you get there early or have reservations. Down side they should open the second bar at 4:30 pm on the weekends. Other then go there ready to get large potions of high quality seafood at great prices for such a high quality establishment. Enjoy",

Whenever I have a craving for Crab Louie I head over. \u00a0Prices have gone up(of course, over 2 decades) and the menu has been shortened considerably. \u00a0But the food is always amazing. \u00a0 By the way, in addition to the food, nothing else has changed(I am pretty sure). \u00a0The bathroom is the same, the decor is the same, the tables and chairs are the same, &amp; the paneling on the walls is the same. \u00a0Kinda funny, but cool too. \u00a0They don't put on airs to make it fancy -- it is just good. \u00a0I almost always get the crab/shrimp Louie combo salad. \u00a0Not on the menu anymore, but they can do it if you ask. \u00a0I wish they had a few more veggies (like it used to), but overall still amazing. \u00a0The shrimp is baby bay shrimp and paired with the crab is the perfect combo. \u00a0Great dressing. Brought friends and family many times and always a hit with the food. \u00a0Parking in back is valet. \u00a0Never have had to wait. Give them a good tip - they work hard. \u00a0No charge when you are dining. If you are nice for a small charge they will let you leave your car after eating so you can walk around along the wharfs and nearby streets. \u00a0Well worth it(we have to get our saltwater taffy across the way before we leave).",

I don't go here very often but we decided to go by on a Thursday. \u00a0It wasn't too busy. \u00a0Remember that if you go during the busy weekends or holidays, it is a mad house and when that happens, food and service can go down a little. \u00a0We dont' go during those times.   We had the crab cakes and clam chowder; both to die for. \u00a0The chowder was as fresh as the ocean with a clean creamy finish in the mouth. \u00a0The crab cakes were fresh and awesome. \u00a0  The cioppino was to die for. \u00a0I sopped up the sauce with sourdough french bread drinking my cold beer. \u00a0I was as happy as a pig in sh*t as Gordon Ramsey would say.   We also had the seafood combo platter. \u00a0The seasoning was lightly done and good. \u00a0Too many people want a lot of seasoning on seafood and it's not about the seasoning, it's about the seafood.   The creme caramel was rich and thick and it was good.   Usually you have to wait in the bar and the bar prices remind you that you are in a big city. \u00a0it's expensive.   Pros: -Fresh seafood -consistent food during non busy times -to die for soups and cioppino -amazing views  Con's: -expensive -bar is really expensive -sometimes the food is hit or miss during really busy times.   This is still a staple in San Francisco and probably always will be. \u00a0Not my first choice to dine, but it's solid and mostly never disappoints.",

Remember the rule of the blind leading the blind?  I decided to avail of the prix fixe menu they have and this is what I had:  Lobster bisque and lobster salad Lamb t-bone on parmesan polenta with caramelized shallots and sauteed swiss chard (main course) Tiramisu and sourdough bread pudding duo (dessert)  Love love LOVE the lobster bisque. I cannot sing it enough praise. The lobster salad was okay, but the lemon wedge made it better.  The lamb I ordered rare and it came out the way I wanted it: nice and bright pink. It was tender and juicy. The veggies that came with it just made this wonderful dish just better.  I liked the tiramisu; I wished there was more of it. The sourdough bread pudding was more firm than I expected from a bread pudding. Oh well, that's ok. It was still good and not bad at all.  The place overlooked the bay, and had a nice view. The staff was uniformed and looked neat and clean. My waitress was nice and polite, and joked back with me when I joked with her.  This place is a seafood haven. You get to splurge a little, but it's worth spending the extra few bucks considering the food and the service here.  My hat's off to you, Scoma's of SF!

The restaurants been around forever and most of the servers have worked here for over 20 years or more per my waitress however they didn't have good food , well at least our lobster's wasn't good.   It's extremely pricey, it's an older restaurant, older demographic. Nothing trendy or hip. I wouldn't call it classy or elegant either, my chair was uncomfortable and my silverware was dirty, my waitress was super sweet about getting me a new set of silverware.. The servers have cute uniforms.   Our food cost around $150 for two of us, salad, entrees and desserts.   Both of our lobsters were super over cooked. My pasta had no flavor but it was cooked perfectly, no sauce , no seasoning just pasta. My steam veggies were just veggies , no flavor. I asked the server if the lobster is usually over cooked. She seemed offended that I asked her, she got into this whole thing about how they broil the food and how they have been in business since 1960's before I was even born, yeah she said that. She was an older lady and it was cute how she took pride in her job and the food, but at the end of the day we didn't like our rubbery over cooked lobster and the comment about when I was born was unnecessary. \u00a0My parents raised me to be polite to my elders, I just smiled and thanked her for letting us know. Anyways we didn't finish our meal and thankfully there is a thing called Yelp :) Despite our lobster experience I wanted to try the Jack Daniels bread pudding, so glad I did.   Personally I won't go back for their food however I might go back for the dessert if I'm in the area, however will never again make a trip to dine here.

We go inside and we are immediately blown away by how tired everything is. \u00a0The carpet is old, the walls are old, the photos are of old people. \u00a0It smells....old. \u00a0It looks like some kind of speakeasy from the '20s that was never once renovated.   We sit down and look at the menu. \u00a0It's basic seafood, but a bit pricey. \u00a0My wife and I both order something from our (old) waiter. \u00a0He is a little peculiar. \u00a0I hear him in the next room yelling at another employee about something minor and give my wife a sideways glance. \u00a0Oh well, we try the bread.  He brings out our entrees and my meal is not what I expected. \u00a0The menu was a little ambiguous, but I didn't return it or anything. \u00a0I'm usually one to just man-up play my hand if I'm at fault. \u00a0The waiter takes it a bit personally and tells my how beautifully prepared the meal is and that I will enjoy it. \u00a0It was an odd tone and I ordered a salad with crab meat on it. \u00a0I'm sure it will be fine. \u00a0He later returns to ask about the food and says, \"Well, I know yours isn't what you wanted.\" \u00a0Whatever. \u00a0I guess I had upset him. \u00a0We paid and left.  Nothing is really bad about this place, but you can do a lot better in San Francisco. \u00a0Go to the dives and eat the seafood there. \u00a0Their food is much better and you don't have to deal with the snooty \u00a0time capsule that thinks it's \"high class.\"",

Our waiter was funny, attentive and overall...quite charming.   My bay shrimp dinner salad was flipping delicious. I don't know how the few ingredients of lettuce, thousand island and bay shrimp can taste so much better than it normally does...but Scoma succeeds in the blowing of the mind.  My lobster/scallop sautee was tasty...however it was a bit heavy. I prefer my seafood without heavy pasta AND rice...yep two starchy carbs in this bad boy...but the quality was still excellent. Next time I am definitely getting the ciopino.  The only thing that could have made my experience better would be if they carted me out and gave me a ride to the jazz bar up the way. I had to roll out of there I was so stuffed!   GOOD TIMES!",

It never seems like they're trying to conserve the ingredients. My favorite dish at Scoma's is the Mixed Seafood Plate. It consists of rice, noodles, scallops, lobster tale, shrimps,..etc. The portions are huge! I usually go to Scoma's for a family dinner (I'm a broke college student, and therefore can't afford food above 20 bucks sighs) and we order about 4 plates for 5 people. We always come back with leftovers!   If you're searching for a place that gives generous portions, delectable taste, and a beautiful view (at the pier), this is the place for you!",

Scoma's was recommended for the view, but we didn't have a view from our seats. \u00a0The service and meal made up for it and the ambience was still nice.  I cannot say enough good things about our server. \u00a0He was attentive to our drinks, made suggestions and answered questions, and helped my daughter with crab etiquette. \u00a0While the service was excellent, it was not stuffy or snobbish.   We started with a bottle of the house white. \u00a0It was mildly sweet and not dry-- the way my husband prefers. \u00a0He liked it, but I would have preferred a red. \u00a0That is my taste issue, though.  I started with a Cesar salad. \u00a0The dressing was light and lemony, with the portion on the smaller side for the price. \u00a0I think it could have used something extra (bacon crumbles, maybe), but I thought chicken or shrimp would be unnecessary.  There was a prix fixe and I really wanted the lamb, but I couldn't resist the cioppino. \u00a0I was not disappointed. \u00a0The portion was large, the tomato broth light and flavorful, and the seafood was perfectly cooked. \u00a0I have a new affinity for scallops because of this meal. \u00a0My cioppino was served with garlic bread which was a wonderful compliment.

We have gone to the Sausalito location many times, but never knew about the San Francisco one.  I like that they have their own parking area with valet parking. Definitely a nice service and touch. What \u00a0I liked about Scomas' environment is that it's classy, yet not over the top. Definitely an old-school classy and fancy restaurant on the water, something that my mom loves.  We were seated in one of the private, smaller dining rooms with an ocean view. At first, we were seated in a cramped table in one of the other rooms, but my mom requested to be moved, and they opened up one of their private rooms for us to sit in. Very nice.  Our server for the evening, Elizabeth, was wonderful. Very friendly, humorous, never bothered or rushed us. She was a sweetheart. For appetizers, we ordered the Mussels. The mussels came in a clear, light broth. The mussels were delicious and very soft. The broth was really good with some garlic and onions mixed in.  For dinner, we didn't know what to order. My mom, sister, and I kept browsing the pasta section exclaiming what we each wanted, but couldn't find EXACTLY what we wanted. Then our server told us that the \"Saute\" section of the menu, we could order that and have it come over pasta. Once we found that out, we were SOLD.  So, the three of us ordered the exact same thing - the Shellfish Saute Sec. I opted for mine to come with a creamy sauce, but it usually comes with a white wine and butter sauce.   The pasta was so delicious, the seafood was fresh, soft, and cooked perfectly. Our pasta came with prawns, scallops, lobster, and crab legs. YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM! The other thing that sold me was the garlic, onions, and mushrooms that came sauteed with the seafood. My absolute favorite veggies when it comes to creamy pasta.  Overall, we had a great experience here. All of the service we received from the valet, to hostess, to server, to busboy, was excellent. The food was great, my mom had a great time. We definitely had a great Mother's Day dinner this year.",

The Broiled Aged New York Steak was ok. The seasoning used was very tasty, but I am pretty sure it was cooked to a medium when I had asked for a medium-rare. My friend ordered the Broiled Mahi Mahi and that was very very good. Very flaky and nicely seasoned. The dessert of the day however fell a little flat. We were given a scoop of spumoni. I was hoping for something maybe a little more extravagant, or even a slice a cake, but... that was it.   Our server was very nice. She was extremely attentive.

In general the experience was wonderful, although there were some odd quirks. \u00a0First when we first entered the restaurant we were told there was an hour wait. \u00a0So, we decided to get something to go. \u00a0The maitre d' was walking by so we asked him if we could place a to-go order. \u00a0He said, \"come this way\" and then proceeded to seat us at an open table. \u00a0A nice surprise but I have no idea why it happened.  On to our drink order. \u00a0My wife asked for a glass of the house champagne, and the waiter brought out something that looked like champagne, except in a wine glass. \u00a0There were no bubbles so my wife told him it was flat and sent it back. \u00a0The next glass was also flat. \u00a0It wasn't until I got the bill that I realized our waiter had served her chardonnay, not champagne. His English wasn't great so I can see how that mistake would occur. However why didn't he or someone else bother to figure out why someone was sending the chardonnay back multiple times? \u00a0Ultimately my wife just drank it.  I ordered the shrimp &amp; crab louie and my wife had the lazy man's cioppino. \u00a0Both were excellent, although also expensive ($32 for the louie, $35 for the cioppino). \u00a0The portions were quite large. \u00a0Also the sourdough bread served to the table was very fresh.  Another comment on the waiter: he never offered fresh ground pepper. \u00a0My wife had to specifically ask for it \u00a0When I'm paying more than $30 for an entree I expect to be offered those sorts of amenities.  Still ultimately we were satisfied with the meal. \u00a0Scoma's is probably the best choice for dining near Fisherman's Wharf, particularly if you want to impress out-of-town friends with your local knowledge. \u00a0Just keep in mind that you may have to wait quite a while for a table on a busy night as they do not accept reservations.",

I started with the shrimp cocktail and my mother ordered the salmon cakes. The shrimp were just meh and tasted like they'd been frozen and not yet 100% thawed. The salmon cakes were so heavily deep fried it was hard to tell whether there was actually any salmon in there. And if there was, you certainly couldn't taste it through the oil and batter.   For our main entree I ordered the broiled swordfish, which was completely tasteless and came served with stiff mashed potatoes and soggy vegetables. Mum had the calamari fritti which was also heavily heavily deep fried and seved with mountains of old rice AND penne pasta...REALLY? We sent back the calamari and it was then replaced with an undercooked calamari dish. We reluctantly took our leftovers but discarded them in the first trash can we came across.

    "review_text": "I grew up on the east coast, so I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to seafood. We Marylanders are pretty picky about our crab. In our minds nothing can compare to the Blue Crabs we pull from the Chesapeake Bay. So when a local friend kept telling me that we needed to go to Scoma's for an awesome seafood dinner, I kind of had that, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever...\" attitude. Then when she said it was on Fisherman's Wharf I was even less impressed with the idea. Tourist trap is what came to mind.   But she was persistent and kept raving about it, so when we had some friends visiting SF and staying in a hotel at Fisherman's Wharf, we decided to give it a try. Their complimentary valet parking makes it so convenient \u00a0- so they already had one star in my book. It sits out at the end of a pier/dock so the views are spectacular - the Golden Gate Bridge to one side and Coit Tower and the Transamerica Building to the other. How can you beat that? They don't take reservations, so if you show up at the prime dinner hours expect to wait. But with views like that, who cares? Wander around the pier a bit, take in the breathtaking scenery of one of the most beautiful cities in the world while you wait!   The tables are rather close together, but otherwise everything about our dinner that night was spectacular! The warm baskets of \u00a0fresh sourdough kept us happy while we decided what to order. My husband got the Lazy Man's Cioppino, which he loved. I got the Seafood Saute Sec. It's got to be one of the best dishes I've ever had! We've since returned several times and have yet to be disappointed!   It's a bit pricey, but for the view and the food, smack in the middle of a touristy area of a city, what else can you expect? \u00a0I am definitely a fan of Scoma's!",

It's still touristy, but it's not over-the-top annoying.  The food is great, but a little higher priced than it should be. The dishes should be a solid $7-8 less than they are. But paying the extra amount for the awesome U-shaped booth right by the window was mostly worth it. The shellfish saute was awesome, the swordfish was lightly fried and perfectly cooked. The calamari (asked for spicy) was good, but definitely not spicy. Lobster ravioli was good, but the saute and fish beat it out hands down.  The servers seem like they have been working there for the last 20-30 years - i.e., also rolling it old school. Felix (our bus boy) is so old school that when one of the people in our party asked for honey, he said, \"for what?\". Now, normally that would be annoying... but it was so ridiculous of an answer from someone that is supposed to be getting you the things that you ask for that it became funny. We basically used that as an excuse to give Felix a hard time, and I think that he appreciated it. Well, maybe he didn't... but we sure had a good time.  Overall really fun experience, and one that could definitely make it hard to pay the bills that month - but something that is classic for a visit to SF.",

Here in SF, Fisherman's Wharf is such a \"trap\" that I often find myself trying to avoid at all cost. \u00a0So when a good friend suggested we dine here one night, it was like asking me to give up my left nut. \u00a0He is in sales, and has eaten many a meals on an expense account, and loves to order Steak n Lobster. \u00a0Of all the places he's traveled to, he claims Scoma's to be very legit for that particular plate. \u00a0We were kinda celebrating the arrivals of our tax refunds, and I do love a good steak n lobster meal, so off to touristy hell, I went.  First of all, it's kinda tucked away on the back of a dock/alley and is not really visible from the main street, so that was a plus for me. \u00a0It is old school in that the food is by no means creative or artistic, but solidly executed fresh seafood. \u00a0It is pricey, but there are plenty of service people to monitor your experience and everything is proper, ie perfect SF sourdough bread, \"soft\" butter to spread, decent drinks, comfortable chairs, etc...  Another friend orders the Swordfish Steak ($32) nice portion with perfect grill marks but served w/ basic rice and steamed veggies. \u00a0Although solid, just nothing memorable. \u00a0The other 2 of us go for the gold and order the Steak n Lobster for $75 a pop. \u00a0He told me not to get an appetizer, a soup, or salad cuz the plate was gonna be hefty. \u00a0He even went as far as to tell me to go easy on the bread, but with warm crusty sourdough probably made just blocks down the street, that morning, I told him there was no way, I was going to leave that bread unmolested.  Our plates arrives and it was everything I anticipated. \u00a0A meaty, maybe 1/2 pound tail of Pacific Lobster, perfectly steamed with the superfluous sprinkling of paprika with a ramekin of perfectly shimmering clear drawn butter. \u00a0A petit filet mignon (6-8 oz) was perfectly cooked with a distinct garlic salt crust and mouth- wateringly tender in the center. \u00a0It came w/ both mashed potato and rice, strange to serve double starch, but at that price, I wasn't complaining. \u00a0Also came with same mediocre steamed veggies. \u00a0  We deliberately hiked here from the the Ferry Building as to build our appetites, and as it turned out, we were so stuffed, we decided to hike back, in lieu to taking a cab. \u00a0It proved to be a worthy meal, a meal good enough for a king's appetite, but at 75 bucks a plate, it may be a once or twice a year thing for me. \u00a0For that much, I can get a 3 course pre-fix meal that won't be as gargantuan a portion but more creative and just as solidly executed. \u00a0Just sayin'. \u00a0  Scoma's, you may be the only reason I ever agree to step foot in this area of cheap t-shirt shops, cheesy street acts and clusters of tourist. \u00a0That is sayin' a lot.",

We arrived at approximately 4:20pm on a Saturday, and it didn't seem to busy. \u00a0The hostess greeted us, and we were waited on by Chris. \u00a0He had some good descriptions and recommendations from the menu. \u00a0Honestly, I was NOT planning on paying more than $15 for a pasta dish. UNTIL one of the servers passed by, and presented another table with a huge plate of seafood pasta! \u00a0The little devil on my shoulder said, \"Screw it you cheap bastard, you're gettin' that dish!\" \u00a0   I ordered the Diplomatica ($38), and this made for all the reason to write my review. \u00a0It had two small lobster tails, fresh shrimp, perfectly cooked soft scallops, and clams. \u00a0With linguine noodles drowning in a savory white cream sauce. \u00a0Maybe a bit too saucey, but just add some parmesan cheese and you're good! \u00a0So glad I tried this, and I had mega-leftovers! \u00a0  The gf ordered the Mixed Seafood Grill ($39) with penne pasta, rice, veggies, shrimp, scallops, and two small sized lobster tails. \u00a0You can tell all of the seafood were fresh because there were just juicy; Not overcooked, and again made perfectly well! \u00a0If you cannot decide on what to order, this huge dish will absolutely satisfy. \u00a0It's a mix of everything, so you can't really go wrong with this one.  Oh yeah, the appetizers: \u00a0The Calamari! \u00a0Soft and well breaded! \u00a0Another winner! \u00a0The sour dough was good, but I was expecting it to be warm. \u00a0No biggie!  Our server started out with Chris who was very polite and funny. \u00a0His shift ended and we were waited on by CC. \u00a0Both were well attentive, and always filled our water glasses. \u00a0One minor mistake was serving my Diplomatica to the gf and vice versa. \u00a0Also no biggie, but as a compliment we were given some Lady Fingers for free. \u00a0Those Lady Fingers were a nice crunchy sweet treat!  I'll absolutely come back, because there's much try like the \"Lazy Man's\" Cioppino and the King Salmon. \u00a0But if I were to recommend anything, it would be to try something that has shrimp or scallops, or both!",

It's nice to get away from the hussle and bussle of the touristy fishermans warf area and drive your car into valet parking, hop out, and get seated. We only waited about five minutes after having a opentable reservation. We were seated next to the waterfront and served with bread and water.  For appetizers, we started off with the crispy calmari. Lightly fried to perfection and so flavorful! The two options of dipping sauce: tartar sauce or cocktail sauce. YUM! Oh boy did it not disappoint! \u00a0I ordered The Diplomatica ($38) with linguine and red sauce. They don't mess around with seafood here and I found my plate with 2 lobster tails, a handful of clams, 5-6 scallops, and 2 shrimps. The sauce, the pasta, and the seafood was cooked to heavenly perfection. I could only finish half my plate! Bf ordered Steamed \"skookum\" Clams ($25) and comes with the biggest bowl topped with clams. The butter, garlic sauce is delicious and i found myself putting down the clams and just drinking the sauce!  If you're looking for a place for a business meal, birthday lunch, celebration, or a simple lunch and dinner, you will not be disappointed! The only thing that I get frustrated with are the stuck up waiters. The first time I came, I felt like the waiter was snobby. This past time, our waiter was even worse. When we inquired about the specials, he sarcastically said, \"everything on the menu is a special!\" Then proceeded to point out some things and laugh at the prices and said it was a \"good deal..sort of\" The only reason why we asked was because there were some dishes on yelp but we didn't see on the menu.. Anyway, after the meal when about to eat dessert, they usually take a knife and scrape off the crumbs. Nope, he didn't bother. Didn't felt taken care of at all by him. The other staff was very helpful on clearing our tables and refilling our drinks. I guess they make the most tip on large parties, business people, or \"fancier\" people drinking wine but he really didn't make us feel like we belonged there.

It makes me wonder how clean other areas of the bar and kitchen really are. There's no excuse for that in a place of this caliber.

Loud, drunk, belligerent behavior by a large party of rude, thoughtless guests, ruining the ambiance for all of the other guests in the dining room, is uncalled for.

    "review_text": "What many newcomers to Scoma's should know is that long before Pier 39's redevelopment to retail, Scoma's was a locals restaurant. It was located on the Wharf because its fishing fleet is there. And, with exception to the hoards of tourists and new people who moved to the Bay Area in the last 10 years, the restaurant has changed very little since the '60's.   The cioppino broth is still made from scratch using the butter of dungenous crab. I have tried other variations of cioppino from NYC to Venice, Italy. Scoma's cioppino is, by far, the most savory.   Was there for the hundredth time last month. Still excellent.  _____________________________________  former reviews: Forget Allioto's and all of the other tourist traps. Scoma's is the finest family owed restaurant on the Wharf. That is why locals, like my family, have been going there since before the hippies. Yes, it is \"old school.\" If it were anything else, we would stop going.   Scoma's has owned and operated their own fishing fleet for decades and serve up the freshest fish daily in the northern Italian style. If you're looking for a classic San Francisco seafood experience, this is it!   Their signature dish is cioppino. It's a rich and savory seafood stew loaded with the freshest and tastiest seafood northern California has to offer. Their Louis salads are great. Their dungenous crab dishes are the best. Their bar serves up oustanding cocktails. The service is usually outstanding.   The middle of the week is the best time to go.",

    "review_text": "I finally had the opportunity to try Scoma's with some great friends over the weekend and I would definitely recommend this place to someone looking for quality, family-style seafood. Not only do they serve fresh, gourmet seafood, but their portions are huge! I strongly recommend two people to one main entree. Let me give you a breakdown of the food before I get to the ambiance:   CLAM CHOWDER: This had just the right consistency (not too creamy, not too chunky) and lots of flavor! I think I even tasted some crab in it. I saw their bowl of Lobster Bisque and it was large enough to have as a main dish. I strongly recommend their clam chowder.   CALAMARI: The calamari was good but I can't say it was the best I've ever had.   FETTUCCINE WITH SMOKED SALMON &amp; ROCK SHRIMP: This pasta dish was very rich and creamy (and delicious). I love fettuccine and smoked salmon, but I never thought of mixing them together; what a great combo! What I love most about this dish is that it's even better after refrigerating for the next day!   SHELLFISH SAUT\u00c9 SEC: This dish included prawns, scallops, lobster, and crab legs with a side of wild rice. Everything on this plate was very well prepared and flavorful, right down to the buttery rice.   As for service: I'd give them an \"A+\", shout out our server HAN MIN, for being so accomodating. From holding some dishes for part of our party who were running a bit behind, to being kind enough to split the bill 5 ways, she was great. Seating is a bit tight, but not a problem. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable and the noise level is just right--meaning you don't get that uncomfortable silence like you have at say, Boboquivari's, and your neighbors aren't too loud that you want to shove a crab leg down their throat. Its a good place for groups, including children.  Scoma's definitely does not disappoint, and you can't go wrong with free valet parking in the city. However, not every place is perfect and they do have their drawbacks such as, of course, the wait. But anything this good is sure to be worth it. It's important to note that you will not be seated unless your entire party is present. It is also important to remember to inform your server that it is someones birthday, therefore entitling the birthday boy/girl to a complimentary slice of dessert! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALFIE! LOL!",

    "review_text": "So I tried to be open minded because a friend of mine visiting from D.C. wanted the Fisherman's Wharf seafood experience. \u00a0I understood the clientele here would be mainly tourists and the servers would make lame \"so where are you from?\" small talk. \u00a0I expected the prices to be inflated given the location on the water in Fisherman's Wharf and tourist demographic. \u00a0However, given such a high Yelp rating, I at least expected tasty food. \u00a0I was sorely disappointed. \u00a0So please note that all those aforementioned hangups were checked at the door and my Two Star rating is only for the food. \u00a0More inland places like Anchor Oyster Bar, Woodhouse Fish Co. and Anchor &amp; Hope have way better San Francisco seafood.  Rock Shrimp Scampi: So I get that \"Scampi\" has two meanings: (1) \u00a0\"small lobster\" such as prawn or langoustine and (2) \u00a0shrimp served in garlic butter and dry white wine. \u00a0Since there was no description on the menu, I assumed it was the latter since that is the norm in the U.S. with Italian-American cuisine. \u00a0What we got were overcooked shrimp in a bland tomato broth. \u00a0Very disappointing.  Calamari Fritti: Pretty standard. \u00a0Didn't sense any extraordinary spices, just a lot of fried batter. \u00a0Would have appreciated a marina dip option instead of just cocktail sauce.  Crabcakes: These came as part of the $26 Hot Sampler Trio along with the two other items listed above. \u00a0Two crabcakes the diameter (and width) of silver dollars arrived. \u00a0Seemed unfair that we got so much mediocre calamari and \"scampi\", but so little crab. \u00a0And the crab cake wasn't that great either, seemed pretty doughy. \u00a0I ended up drowning the blandness in generous dollops of remoulade.  Lazy Man's Cioppino: This was the whole reason for coming here. \u00a0To show my visiting friend a San Francisco specialty at Fisherman's Wharf with a nice view. \u00a0Sadly, it disappointed all around. \u00a0The fish chunks were way too fishy and overcooked. \u00a0I prefer a delicate filet that is lightly poached so not to overpower the rest of the dish. \u00a0Though I appreciate being a lazy man and not having to crack a messy crab, I didn't appreciate seeing just crab dust. \u00a0Whoever was cracking the crab for me could have been more careful to maintain the integrity of the chunks. \u00a0The scallops were a bit overcooked too. \u00a0The shellfish (mussels and clams) were ok. \u00a0We got huge chunks of garlic bread to dip into the broth, but they were really stingy on the garlic butter so it tasted like bread.",

    "review_text": "Wow, a 45 minute wait on a Monday? And no reservations, ouch. As the minutes ticked by...past 45 minutes and pushing an hour...my hunger almost overtook me. I stared intently as the hostess from where I stood about 15 feet in front of her for the past hour. I watched as people whom I think arrived after us got seated first (other two person parties like me and my friend). Finally, I went up to her and asked how much longer for us and she waved to the seating hostess and said, she'll seat you right now. Interesting.  Once seated, the service was attentive and the food was quite good! It is a little pricey and quite touristy, hence the big crowds, but I enjoyed my dinner. The lobster bisque was creamy and had a little bit of bitty chunks of lobster in it. I tried their \"most popular dish\" (as the menu states), which is the shellfish saute sec. This dish entailed crab (already de-shelled), scallops, and baby lobster tails saut\u00e9ed with onions, mushrooms and garlic in a white wine and butter sauce. At 36 bucks, its a pretty penny, but it was \u00a0really enjoyable! The sauce was tasty and it came over a bit of rice. It also came with undressed pasta, but it was good with a little grated parmesan on top and dipped in the saute sauce. It also came with some steamed veggies. Their portions are quite generous so I was stuffed and had some leftovers (and believe me, I am not a dainty girlie eater)!   I think this place is a pretty standard seafood place with fresh, tasty seafood. Being a touristy area, it's a little pricey and busy, so come prepared for $100 for two people and come early!",

Plus, the bits of clam meat had only one or two grains of sand (or whatever gives that crunchy sensation while chewing) which is extra brownie points in my book.  Our lunch consisted of a seafood appetizer sampler, green salad, and the aforementioned chowder. The portions were ample, and the food was delicious (in a crisp, they-must've-got-this-seafood-this-morning kind of way). Heartily recommended for even part-time seafood enthusiasts.  As an aside, the ambiance in there was incredible. From the black and white photos of famous people to the cozy seating arrangements, you get the sense that Scoma's has been doing their thing (and doing it well) for a long time.  Expensive, but in my opinion, completely worth it.",

The pasta consisted of linguine, mussels, salmon and sun dried tomato. Fantastic combination, however, the more appropriate name for the entree would have been Salmon Garibaldi. The ratio of fish to pasta was way off. I soon found myself playing hide n seek for the noodles after a few bites.

    "review_text": "Scoma's remains my favorite seafood place in San Francisco, but my second visit wasn't as impressionable as my first. There's always a long wait at this place, but we were lucky this weekend and got a table within ten minutes. While waiting outside, we noticed that they now have a dinner prix-fixe menu, which makes a meal quite affordable in this economy. But after we were seated, the waiter actually removed the prix-fixe menu from our table - I'm not sure if that is regular, but isn't that the whole point of having the menu there? I ended up ordering the lazy man's cioppino after having the seafood saute previously.   We started with half a dozen oysters, but they weren't enjoyable because they weren't even shucked properly. I am by no means an oyster connoisseur, but every time I have had them, the meat was severed from the shell. It was a bit unexpected to try to eat them while they were still connected to the shell. \u00a0Despite that, they were still fresh and good, albeit a few grains of sand from the shell. As always, the mini crab cakes were great and didn't require any heavy breading. I also had a taste of the lobster bisque that was part of the prix-fixe and it was quite good. There was even bits of lobster, which were not very big, but a good portion for an appetizer from a prix-fixe. As for my cioppino, it was delicious as expected. Best cioppino I've ever \u00a0had and loaded with generous portions of fish, shrimp, crab, scallops, and more. What I enjoyed the most was ironically the buttered piece of toast dipped in the soup. It was delicious, but everything in the cioppino was amazing too. The serving size was so large, I couldn't even finish it all. I ended up trying to scoop all the seafood meat out and bypassing the soup.   I also tried the dessert portion and at that point I was too full to eat anything. That may have played a role in my disinterest in neither the cheesecake nor the bread pudding &amp; tiramisu. Good food was had, but I could have had a better experience.",

    "review_text": "Service was awful this time. The food and prices were still good, given that we took advantage of Dine About Town. However, our server was ridiculously slow and inattentive. He only appeared maybe 4 times, and that was just to take our orders and drop off food. He never stopped by to check on our meal and how we were doing. There were many 5-10 minute gaps in the meal during which we sat there with empty plates. I watched many parties who were seated after us finish their meals and new parties take their place. Those parties then finished their meals at the SAME TIME as us, even though some of them were also doing DAT! I think that service at Scoma's is usually really good, but we just got a very lackadaisical server. I'm not sure why he was so slow, considering the fact that he can make more money in tips if he can move us quicker! And we weren't the only party in his section that suffered. There was a nice couple behind us who literally sat with their menus, ready to order, for about 15 minutes. They looked so bored...  We arrived at 6:40, were told 45 minute wait. We were called and seated by 7:25, so the accuracy of their wait time was much appreciated. However, we didn't get our food until 7:50, and we didn't get out the door until 9:30!!!! Talk about a slow, leisurely meal.  I'll probably still return, but I hope not to get seated in this guy's section again!  Oh and about the food:  - Crab cakes on watercress salad: Very tasty! I liked how the crab cakes were mostly crab and very little filler. I was able to share generous tastings with everyone else at the table.   I also sampled the lobster bisque (very rich!) and a bit of clam chowder. The complimentary sourdough bread is a great utensil for scooping up every bit of the soup!  - Scallops and linguine: You get 5 medium sized scallops on a bed of slightly too overcooked linguine topped with a large dollop of pesto. This dish was actually very large in size, which pleased me. It didn't have a ton of flavor though, and the scallops seemed slightly overdone. I had to add some pepper. I didn't finish this so I had enough to bring home for leftovers. It tasted pretty good the next day, but I was kind of appalled at how oily the sauce was. Must have been the pesto.  The lamp was slightly overcooked for medium rare, but I enjoyed the Parmesan polenta, caramelized onions, and sauteed spinach that were under it.   My dad said his halibut had been precooked and then reheated. He was VERY displeased with the texture, as the reheating was obvious from the mushy crust of the fish. He also said it was too salty.  - Tiramisu and sourdough bread pudding: Tiramisu was really good. The portion size of both was very generous. I liked the tiramisu a lot, but by then I was stuffed. The sourness of the bread and the sweetness of the bread pudding was a bit too much for me, so I didn't finish it.   The raspberry cheesecake with chocolate crust was SO. GOOD. I should have ordered that instead.  One thing I'll give to Scoma's is that they don't skimp on portion sizes, even for Dine About Town selections. And all the other plates I saw emerging from the kitchen were massive as well!  Corkage is $20.",

It was bar far the best seafood dish in the Bay Area. BY FAR! Service was great. One big negative: a bit price. $30+ for the halibut.  My boss had the filet mignon. He could've easily cut that steak with a butter knife. Very juicy too. Good job Al Scoma. RIP.",

    "review_text": "One of my team members is commuting from Chicago. After a long workday, I asked what he was he'd like for dinner. He eagerly said seafood! This guy's never been to San Francisco, so as a surprise, we took him down to Fisherman's Wharf for dinner.   Driving into SF from the south close to sunset does offer some great views of the city and the bay bridge. Even in the early evening, the wharf was still busy with tourists and folks picking up some food on the way home. We parked on Embarcadero and proceeded to Pier 47.   Having visited to fisherman's wharf many times, I know enough to stay away from the tourist-trap restaurants that dominate FW. Behind the glamour, in a little alley, lies one of the true seafood meccas this fine city.   Scoma's is always buzzing with people. We arrived early evening and waited in the bar for our table. There are very few restaurants left where the bartenders still wore white tuxedos - it just gives this place a sense of class and decorum. The guys ordered beers and I started with a crisp Ferrari-Carano sauvignon blanc.   After about 25 minutes, our party was seated next to the window. We had a view of the day boat fisherman. It reminded me of that scene in Jaws when Roy Scheider looks at the boat he's going to hunt the shark and says \"You're going to need a bigger boat.\"   We started off with the sampler appetizer that came with crab cakes, shrimp scampi and calamari friti. It was delicious and really got our appetites going. My coworkers ordered the fresh snapper and the salmon over crab raviolis. I simply ordered the steamed 1/2 crab it and was so fresh and sweet, it had me thinking I could have finished a whole crab!   The wait staff and servers were gracious, precise and early filled out water glasses and cleared away the dishes after every course. We ended the meal with espressos and the chef's special chocolate torte. It was made with bittersweet chocolate and was sinfully silky smooth. We ate heartily, laughed too loudly, was happily satiated and thoroughly enjoyed our time and dinner at Scomas.",

The bf and I showed up for dine about town last week on THURSDAY, they told us 35-40 minutes and 1 hour and 15 minutes later we were seated. By then there were tons of empty tables around so I am a little confused what took so long, especially on a weeknight.   Low ceilings, awkward staircases and limited window area do kindof give it the feel of a trailer home inside. I was definitely expecting something more impressive inside given their ideal location at the end of a pier. The bar area was crowded with everyone waiting for their table, and people were pushing by the whole time because it was a pathway. I was excited they had Gordon Biersch hefeweizen and another lighter beer places don't usually have on tap, so props to the bar.   The appetizers were definitely the best part of the meal. The crabcakes were melt in your mouth, and the caesar salad/ clam chowder combo was excellent as well. Long wait for the main course though, and I was pretty frustrated by then so picking apart an entire crab by hand was not exactly what I had in mind. Would have been useful for the menu to spell out what kind of crab was coming on my pasta. Very oily penne, but overall delicious, if someone else had been cracking the crab for me. Just felt like every bite was spit out a piece of shell, wipe butter off my hands, repeat.. The bf's tuna was the best I've ever tasted tuna, since apparently it's super hard to cook exactly right. The raspberry cheesecake for dessert was a little bit of a letdown, definitely dry and cakey and somewhat tasteless.   Our server Sonny apparently didn't speak too much English and got our check wrong twice. Not a fun experience on that end. Overall service was slow and not too attentive. I think maybe we got our water refilled once, by someone else.   Overall a tasty and unique dine about town experience, never to be repeated on a normal night since it's wayyy out of our price range.",

We split the cold seafood app for 2 - $25 - which came with 2 oysters, 2 clams, 4 prawns and 4 pieces of crab. \u00a0I thought this was pretty reasonable and the prawns were delicious! \u00a0For entrees, two of us ordered the swordfish and one ordered the snapper. \u00a0All entrees were served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies. \u00a0I passed on the potatoes and the veggies were your standard carrot/broccoli/cauliflower combo and just so-so. \u00a0The swordfish was cooked perfectly and just melted in my mouth. \u00a0The entrees seemed a bit high, starting around $30 for pretty much everything but it makes sense when you factor in the location. \u00a0We also had 3 desserts, Vanilla Cheesecake, Apple Crisp and Lemon Tart. \u00a0All were good but the Lemon Tart was the winner.  Our waiter was very attentive and didn't leave us waiting too long in between visits to check on us. \u00a0The decor was a bit 'old-men's club' but maybe that's just because we were in a room with pictures of all sports memorabilia. \u00a0  Overall it was a good experience...just give a 3 for the noise level, elevated prices and older decor.",

I started off with a cup of Clam Chowder and got to try the Crab Cakes shared with the table. \u00a0The Chowder was good and loaded with clams. \u00a0Likewise, the Crab Cakes from were loaded with crab and were pretty plump and breaded nicely.

I don't know what much else there is to say about Scoma's. \u00a0The seafood was definitely fresh and the portion sizes were pretty generous, but I thought the food was pretty overpriced for what you get. \u00a0Well, the bright side is that they have plenty of tables, so if you have a big group to feed and happen to be around the Fisherman's Wharf area, Scoma's would be good enough to handle that.",

It was a mixed crowd with after-work co-workers, tourist couple and families, and older couples. \u00a0For those who grew up in the City, it's a bit of a Back to the Future experience. \u00a0Our waitress was efficient and friendly and the staff made sure our water glasses were full. \u00a0The valet was extremely nice and parked my vehicle near the entrance. \u00a0Regarding the Cioppino, they also offer a \"Poor Man's\" version where they remove the shells from the crab (it's pricier which goes against my thrifty conscience). \u00a0The cuisine is a nice mix of North Beach and seafood, packaged in a touristy neighborhood. \u00a0The business celebrated a recent 45th anniversary last week and gave an additional $5.00 on the above menu. \u00a0Darn, didn't make it back in time to catch that discount.",

I skimmed through some reviews and they all looked pretty promising.   So we parked at one of the lots by Joe's Crab Shack and decided to go there on foot so we could browse or sightsee on the way over. When we got to the restaurant we saw there was free valet parking, so you can imagine our annoyance with ourselves... Especially since it was quite a cold and windy night. Oh well, next time we'll know.  They had a prix fixe menu that offered a choice of appetizer soup, an entree, and then a dessert. He had the Lobster Bisque, I had the Organic Butternut Squash with Creme Fraiche and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds. I preferred his soup, but mine wasn't bad either. For my entree, I had the Broiled Prawns on Linguine Pomodoro w/  3 Wild Gulf Prawns, Fresh Tomato, Garlic, and Basil. He had the Broiled Swordfish with White Beans, Swiss Chard, and Pancetta. It looked like a small portion for someone with a big appetite like he has, but later he said it was the right size and he was comfortably full instead of stuffed. My pasta was okay, I think I got jipped and should have had 4 prawns according to some others experiences on here, LOL. Anyway. For dessert he had the Tiramisu w/ Sourdough Bread Pudding Duo, and I had the Walnut Brownie and Triple Espresso Ice Cream w/ Caramel Sauce.  Anyway, the service was just meh. I mean, our waiter wasn't rude to us or anything, but he seemed to be chumming it up with every table BUT ours, serenading two Bronx lady tourists with some Sinatra, \u00a0joking with some silver-haired group of women having their 40 year school reunion at the restaurant.

I had the Dungeness Crab Risotto... one of the most delicious things I've ever had in my life. \u00a0The risotto was so rich in flavors and well balanced. \u00a0The amount of Dungeness crab was great too.

Ordered clam chowder and Hot sampler trio platter for two, and, of course, the cioppino. Hostess was not very hospital but the waitress served with a smile. Han min was her name and she treated us very well. Making sure we were comfortable and our food came on time. First the appetizer and then our meal. So the food was always hot and right on time. Like a meal is supposed to be! Our main course was slow in coming out. But there was a bit of a mix up in the kitchen. Mistake made with my cioppino. Brought me a delicious looking scallop in some cream sauce with penna pasta. Looked good! Just apologies and nothing much for that. Didn't get to keep the pasta. XD Sun was another server who helped us out. Made sure our water glasses were always full. Grated pepper on our pastas and cheese... He was a bit abrupt though. All service, no smile.  This is a great sit down restaurant for sitting and /enjoying/. The food comes in a timely manner and one course after another. A perfect date spot to enjoy each other's company with good food and a good view.   Eat slow and dont order too much. Large servings of perfectly cooked seafood.  A for sure anniversary spot for me and Der Boif.",

Started off with raw clams on the half shell and some corn and crab chowder. Clams were the best I've ever had. Even the cocktail sauce stands out here. The chowder was a little bland for what I was expecting. I'm from Boston and a snob with chowder, so I'll let it go. Now the cioppino, is best of the best.

My favorite was a white sauce pasta with prawns that was paired with the most amazing glass of wine. For what you pay and the quality it is surprising how generous the portions are.

Probably because we arrived after 8p...and it's a Thursday. Note: meter is cheaper after 7pm. Though, I believe the restaurant offers complimentary valet parking.  - Place was packed, but NO WAIT luckily.   OUR FOOD:  * Calamari Fritti $14 Our starter. Squid was fresh. Probably won't be ordering this on our next visit (if just us 2) cause we couldn't finish it and it got us kind of full. I think I'm just sick of calamari, honestly. Feeds 3-4.  * Seafood Salad (Smoked Salmon, Prawns, Dungeness Crabmeat, Bay Shrimp) $33  This is actually an entree, but we ordered to split. This is what you call seafood salad! The prawns were HUGE! Take a look at picture #4; 1st one on the left. Hella crabmeat and the salmon blanketed the salad. The best seafood salad ever! It also had anchovies and olives, btw. People all around us just kept staring at it! Couldn't finish this one either, so our server bagged it up to go. As a side salad, this feeds 4-5, maybe 6!  * Lobster Newburg Alla Scoma $36 HUGE! Loved it! Lobster toppling off the side of the shell and topped with melted Provolone cheese (for you cheese lovers, this is a MUST-HAVE). Very flavorful! Entree included sides of veggies, wild rice, and penne pasta sprinkled with parmesan.   * Lobster Thermidor Alla Scoma $36 Also huge! My husband ordered this and enjoyed it. It's just like my order above, only that it's topped with Hollondaise sauce instead of cheese.   * Tiramisu $9  Loved it! It had the cutest presentation! Served as if it were a large mug of cappuccino...with an all-chocolate spoon in the middle. Oh, there was cookie stick on the side, too. Feeds 2-3.   * Coffee $3 (with unlimited refills) Fresh!   Oh, I almost forgot - we also each had a glass of wine :)   DISLIKE: Our seating. We were in the middle of a section where the tables were TOO close together. It felt like we were seated with a party of 12. There was however, an entertaining moment; a 40+ year old man at the table next to us singing Flo Rida's, Low. :D  BILL: Pricey! But we were celebrating :) Total + tip came out to $192. but as you can see, we ordered everything...AND we have leftovers for breakfast! By the way, we couldn't finish our lobster either. Tim (our server) was EXCELLENT and each dish was served when WE were ready. Water and coffee were refilled without being asked.   We love this place and will definitely be back!",

The prices are extremely steep, and Scoma's counters that with ridiculous portion sizes. \u00a0They like to support the \"sustainable\" fish movement. \u00a0Unfortunately, with the simple preparations and single levels of flavors, I would like a bit smaller portions with more depth of flavor.  My cioppino stew was definitely a hearty dish. \u00a0Even at $32, it provided an enormous amount of seafood and an overly buttered slice of bread. \u00a0 There was probably about 2 fish fillets, 20 baby shrimp, 4 large shrimp, 8 scallops, and 5 clams. \u00a0Oh, and there was definitely a half crab in there, which I picked myself in order to save $3! \u00a0If I was a starving fisherman, it would no doubt have satisfied, but the flavors were very one-dimensional. \u00a0It was basically marinara over seafood. \u00a0Way too tomatoey.  I had a few bites of my friends' scallop dishes, and they definitely gave generous portions. \u00a0The scallop risotto was not bad, but it lacked a certain freshness. \u00a0The sauteed scallops were somewhat ordinary and merely served over rice.  Scoma's is a great restaurant for a night out on the pier, but if you are truly looking for seafood, go into some of the more refined seafood joints. \u00a0This one is more about packing customers in than the food, and it is very pricey.",

Scoma's is the type of place that takes you back in time. I walk in and expect to find my grandma wearing a lovely dress and gloves.. the way she looked and dressed in the late 1960's.   Scoma's is old school. The decor is right out of the 70's. The servers almost could wear their uniforms for Halloween. However, old school is GOOD. The service is excellent! Servers are friendly, attentive, appear at regular intervals without being intrusive. They don't rush you. They know EVERYTHING about the vast menu. This is an old fashioned restaurant with old fashion customer service. I LOVE IT!   We arrived to a find a crowded pier and crowded restaurant. It's Saturday evening, who cares! We put our name in and head to the bar after being told it would be only be a 10-15 minute wait. We stood at the bar for less than a minute, didn't even have time to order our drinks, and they called our name. What? The place is packed and they're calling us already? Yippey!   The food is soo good. All the fish is fresh, fresh, fresh and also wild caught (no farmed fish here). The chefs have the knack of cooking everything to perfection so even the super meaty fish arrives tender and moist. Food arrives HOT and portions are generous.   Mr. started out with a prawn cocktail. He couldn't decide between the prawns or the baby shrimp. When our server brought him his prawn cocktail, she included a small portion of the baby shrimp so he could taste the difference. Very nice touch!   I started out with a mixed green salad with a side of their delish anchovies. Mmmm.. Fresh and cold and tasty! Their Blue Cheese is heavenly.   Mr. had the Cajun salmon which was cooked perfectly and very moist and flavorful. I went for broke and got the lazy man's chippino. So good! I loved the garlic bread that came with it. I could have easily just gone for the bread dipped in the chippino sauce. MMM...   Do you want to know a secret? Shh.. come closer and I'll whisper it.. they have FREE valet parking! Yes, that's right, the best deal in town. You pull up to the door, hop out of the car and hand the keys to the attendant. Be nice, give him $5 or $10 when you come back to get your car. It's the best deal in town and easy to do (if you don't get caught in a traffic jam coming down Al Scoma Way).   This was our third time having dinner at Scoma's.

It did have potatoes (not a big fan), but also a hearty helping of clams. My seafood was cooked to perfection with a mini lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, and crab leg meat. The sauce was also quite good and light, without being overbearing in flavor. I also liked that the rice (pilaf?) soaked up all the juices.  Our waitress was also very personable and nice!

They continued to bicker over the next 30 minutes or so. We would have left to find another place but as grouchy as that bartender was he did make a good margarita. We are from San Antonio so that is saying a lot.  Finally seated my girlfriend and I ordered an appetizer and another round of drinks. Things were going great and this review would likely have been three stars had we stopped there but when it came time for the main course everything fell apart.   Our waitress was very difficult to find. Only the guy that refills the water was ever seen. The risotto was 33 dollars and terrible. It was watery, bland, and did I mention $33....  If you absolutely want to eat here get a margarita, and lobster bisque. Eat somewhere else for your entree. It was our only bad experience in our entire gorgeous vacation to San Francisco.",

After much Yelp checking and rejection (by myself - I was fussy for some reason) we landed at Scoma, a totally old school restaurant that reminded me of the restaurants that used to exist in Trenton back in the day. Waiters that have been working there for 40 years, wood decor and pictures of celebrities who have graced their presence over the years.  Service was ... good. We felt ignored at times and our waiter never told us the specials which every other table around us were told. I ordered the broiled salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The salmon was HUGE and very good. The mashed potatoes were lumpy and bland and the vegetable was broccoli which I don't like. My three star review is based on my meal only. T got the lazy man's cioppino and I think it was one of his favorite meals while we were there. I'm pretty sure this is a case where I ordered wrong which is disappointing. But there you go. Oh, and it was ex-pensive. At least no one left hungry ...",

They have lunch specials that are under $20 that Hubby and Sis tried. \u00a0Sis had the Crab and Shrimp Louie and said she had never seen a Louie with so much seafood on it. \u00a0Piles of fresh shellfish that was stunningly delicious. \u00a0Hubby had the Fish &amp; Chips, but wasn't crazy about them. \u00a0I had the Salmon and Shrimp Alfredo which had a light and lovely sauce that wasn't too heavy and really hit the spot. \u00a0Delicious!  The wine list is packed full of fabulous wine to go along with everyone's meal and we enjoyed a fine bottle of red.  So the next time a friend comes to town and asks to play tourist at Fisherman's Wharf, don't cringe - indulge!! \u00a0Scoma's is the way to recharge your energy before wandering the streets of San Francisco.",

It's kind of an old school look inside with lots of wood and some nautical hints. The food is old school delicious.

Sometimes you just want fresh fish with the least tampering possible and you can get it done beautifully here along with just about any other seafood craving you have.

The bisque was completely smooth with no actual chunks of lobster meat. The fresh lobster meat on the side was only about the size of a quarter, but at least it tasted great. I was a little annoyed that my cup of soup was about 2/3 full.  My entree was linguine with diver scallops. They definitely didn't skimp on the fresh scallops, but the sauce wasn't memorable.  For dessert, I opted for the tiramisu. It came in an espresso cup, and while it was delicious, it was only about two bites. Tasty, but nothing special.  I'm glad we weren't rushed, but the service was incredibly slow and the atmosphere was too stuffy for me. Maybe it would have been better if we'd sat by a window to better enjoy the views.

Reluctantly, I logged onto Yelp to find some semblance of a decent place in the Wharf, and I had remembered a client once recommending Scoma's.   To my surprise, it was actually a decent venue. A fairly relaxed restaurant (especially for the Wharf area), with a pleasant ambiance, and good seafood. I ordered the fixed price menu of the day - the butternut squash soup, the Petrale Sole (the fish special), and the warm brownie a la mode with a warm caramel sauce. Everything ordered was delicious.  There are but two complaints I have about Scoma's - one, the wait staff seemed a bit patronizing and had that Disneyland-esque feel about them (I was so tempted to just blurt out, \"I live here, I'm not a tourist,\" but refrained from doing so). And second - when we went to split the bill on 2 cards, the waiter accidentally put the entire bill on my one card. Unfortunately, it was my debit card, and the entire bill had to sit on my card for the next 4 or 5 days, until the correct amount posted to my account. It was an easy mistake, but it sucked, and I wished they'd had a better POS system to simply void the mistake.   Anyhow, all in all, I think I prefer Scoma's to the Pier Market - the only other restaurant I've eaten at for dinner in the Wharf. Though, I do wonder what it's like up top at Boudin for dinner?",

    "review_text": "Let me start by saying that I have been coming to Scoma's for years. Unfortunately after my visit tonight, I don't think I'll be back. San Francisco is full of too many great places for me to keep visiting simply for the nostalgia of what this place used to be.   First, I'd agree with other reviewers that this isn't a modern fine-dining establishment. The d\u00e9cor is definitely a throwback to old-school seafood restaurants, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. Lots of wood paneling and memorabilia on the walls. Tourists used to look in, see the prices and fancy clothes and turn around to head back to Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., but those days are long gone. There were plenty of people in camouflage cargo shorts waltzing in. That might be more a statement about society than the restaurant, but there it is. Sorry if you like camouflage pants or Bubba Gump.   The service has always been a high point at Scoma's. Tonight was no exception. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful. The only minor blemish for gluten-free diners: tonight was our first visit after my wife had to adopt a gluten-free diet regimen. We looked ahead to ensure there were good options on the menu (there were) but our waiter wasn't very knowledgeable about the different options. Some of the menu items that would normally be gluten-free (even simple grilled fish) didn't carry that designation, which was confusing. Just something to consider for those with a dietary restriction.   The food was ultimately the reason for the low score in my book. We started with the highly vaunted lobster bisque. It barely even tasted like lobster, much less contained any - it was more tomato bisque than anything. I've had better store-bought.   With entr\u00e9es, I went with cioppino while my wife chose crab risotto. The seafood part of my cioppino was pretty good - a little squid-heavy for my taste and with decidedly non-traditional lump crab (is that why it's \"lazy\" cioppino?), but overall it's good and there's plenty of it. The problem was the tomato sauce. It tasted like a cross of canned spaghetti sauce and tomato soup poured over the seafood - bland and weirdly thick, not the spicy, wine and tomato-y broth that usually comes with the dish. Just plain weird.   The risotto was even worse. First, they used long-grain rice, not Arborio or another short-grain rice. I'm no food snob but it looked like they dumped Minute rice onto the plate. It didn't look edible, much less appetizing. Second, there were random peas, mushrooms and tomatoes throughout (none of which was mentioned on the menu). Risotto should be rich, creamy and flavorful. This was none of those.",

After the meal, I had to actively check to make sure that my plane had not fallen out of the sky, crashed into a hillside, and killed everyone on board; after eating here, I thought I had died and gone to food heaven.  We arrived around 7:00 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was packed to the rafters. However, in spite of that, we were seated promptly (inside of 5 minutes). Our waitress was attentive and came to the table frequently, but not so often that it became creepy. Refills on drinks came quickly; we never ran dry at the table.  For our appetizers, my girlfriend ordered a Caesar salad, while I ordered the \"world's-best\" clam chowder. The salad was prepared and dressed perfectly, with the lemon in the dressing giving the salad that one last missing element. To me, this is one sign of a stellar restaurant - take the classics, maybe put a small spin on them, and execute them flawlessly. As for my chowder, I am always skeptical when something is advertised as the \"world's best,\" but this particular dish did not disappoint. This chowder was as good or better than any I'd ever had on the East Coast, and was delicious from the first spoonful to the last.  Our entrees came out shortly thereafter, and they did not disappoint either. My girlfriend got the salmon, while I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna. First of all, both fish were cooked perfectly, but what blew me away were the portion sizes. Both my girlfriend and myself received huge portions of fish, to the point where we both stuffed ourselves stupid in order to eat them. Sadly, we saved no room for dessert.  The only drawback of this meal would be the price; it was rather expensive ($60 per person, including tip). However, I didn't have a problem with that price, as the food my girlfriend and I received was worth every penny.  My meal at Scoma's was one of the best meals I have ever had. The food was fantastic, the service was excellent, and while the price was high, I didn't mind paying extra for such quality. If you are a fan of seafood, this place should be on your list of must-visits when you visit Fisherman's Wharf.",

A friend suggested that we try out Scomas for dinner. They do not take reservations and from what I've read, the wait can be daunting. I called them around 7pm on Wednesday to see how long the wait was going to be to grab a table around 8pm. The lady on the phone said that it was about a 40 minute wait. When we arrived, we grabbed a drink at the bar and waited for our name to be called. There were a handful of parties waiting around for their tables. Note: They only seat parties where everyone is present. To my surprise, names were being called quite frequently and one right after the other. The restaurant didn't see large but they have a good number of tables available. We were seated right around 8:10pm. By then, a lot of tables were open and the restaurant seemed less busy. We decided to try their \"Triple Play\" which was basically a choice of appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert. For about $40, they offered at least 4 dishes to choose from, which was great. I choice the lobster bisque, the scallop linguine and the three of us shared all 3 desserts. Everything was fantastic. The food came out in a timely manner. The food wasn't as hot as I would have liked but it tasted just fine. I'll have to come back and try other seafood entrees.   Great deal if you choose the Triple Play menu, validated/free valet parking in the back, relatively fast seating for a weeknight and great seafood dishes. I would love to check this place out for lunch and take in the views of the water.",

Most of the ingredients were green beans rather than crab meat or rice. The appetizers weren't good either.   I've lived in the area for more than four years so I know the kinds of good fancy seafood that I like, but the food here was nowhere near the standards.   Also, I asked for the bill after making it CLEAR that we weren't getting dessert, but the waiter nevertheless brought the dessert menu INSTEAD OF the bill. Then he asks us if we were getting coffee. Thinking that what he brought us was the bill, it totally looked as if the coffee was complimentary and as if he was apologizing for the 2 hour wait we had to go through after being told that the wait would be only 45 minutes -- so we asked for coffee. Seconds later we realized to our dismay that we didn't get the bill from him yet, and the coffee was going to be charged on the bill, so I actually had to walk up to our waiter to cancel the order for coffee. How not classy...... We all felt like we were tricked into paying more.. it may have been his small mistake of the day but there's only so much you can tolerate after being ripped off in terms of time and money.  In sum, if I ask for the bill and say no to the dessert menu then I want the bill, not the dessert menu. Give me what I ask for and don't give me what I clearly and loudly refused.",

As typical, ordered a variety of dishes. \u00a03 ordered the pasta diplomatica, a couple of crab cakes, a cippiono, and I had the lamb. \u00a0They have \"Dine about town\" special for $35 that includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. \u00a0Considering most entrees are $30-$35, that's a great value.  The food, especially the seafood was good. \u00a0Portions are large and the service outstanding. \u00a0Water glasses are always full. \u00a0Waitress cut and served our birthday cake for us. \u00a0Its expensive, but you expect that. \u00a0Still, a solid choice for a special occasion dinner after all the years.",

Here's what we had...the dungeness crab cakes where okay, flavorful but bread-to-crab ratio was leaning more towards bread. \u00a0I guess I just got my hopes up a little too much, maybe we should've went to Pacific Cafe instead. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered the shellfish saute which seems to be a big hit at the restaurant and for good reason 'cause it was yummy! \u00a0Small lobster tales, scallops, and prawns all sauteed in a garlic-white wine sauce...it was pretty good and I think this dish saved the rating from a 2 star.  I think I know why Scoma's is one of the highest grossing restaurants in the nation...their prices! \u00a0I don't think I've ever spent over $70 on lunch until I ate here. \u00a0Just a warning...be prepared to pay the big bucks dinning at Scoma's. \u00a0So the question is...will I come back? \u00a0Maybe to give it another shot, cause I want to like it, I really do.",

Went in at 6:05pm and I asked the hostess how long is the wait, she confidently replied, \"...at 6:15pm\" And I thought to myself, wow, seriously? OK..then, I stepped aside and waited. 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, 47 minutes later, I got my table. Then, I asked her, \"what happened to my 6:15 on the dot table ready comment? And she said, \"it happens...\" So much for a great impression.  Sat down at the table and waited by a server promptly and he said something about the specials which I didn't hear very well. Anyways, ordered the food, waited for about 10 minutes, food came. The only thing that's worth mentioning is their famous Lazy Man's Cioppino..not because it's so fabulous, IT WAS HORRIBLE !!! They got their name right, so damn LAZY ! They don't even bother cooking the tomato sauce properly. To me, it was just a bottle of Prego dumped into the pot, stirred a little (please note that the sauce was not even hot, it was....luke warm), then, throw in the seafood. \u00a0Unless you're up for some \"..a-little-better-than-microwave-tv-dinner..\" type of food with HIGH price. GO TO SCOMA'S ! The rest of the food, cod, seafood platter, clam chowder and fried oysters, go to Red Lobster or Sizzler instead...  The only reason why I give 1 star is because of the view.

    "review_text": "*** For all of you seafood lovers out there ***  Scoma's is a hidden gem within Fisherman's Wharf. Nestled in a little back lot off of Al Scoma Way, this place can be tricky to spot if you're not paying attention. If you do drive there, the parking is strictly valet unless you park on the street.   The decor gives off almost a boathouse type of vibe. Depending on where you're sitting you can catch small glimpses of the city or the bay. The service here is excellent, they are friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and very attentive.  I highly recommend the Spice Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Cake as a starter. Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of crisp, you catch both the salmon and shrimp flavors with each bite. For an entree I recommend the Scoma's Shellfish Saute which is an assortment of shellfish (2 Lobster Tails, Jumbo Prawns, Large Scallops, \u00a0and Dungeness Crab meat) served over penne pasta, rice pilaf and a vegetable medley in a buttery wine sauce. This is the epitome of perfection. Each savory bite is filled with sweet decadent flavors of the shellfish. Whenever we dine here I can never bring myself to order anything else. The Saute is a winner and worth every penny.  Whether you consider this a touristy spot or not, it's definitely a must if you're craving fresh, delicious seafood. It's a bit on the pricier side so I wouldn't say this is a go to every time you're in the area but it's definitely a great spot for a nice intimate dinner or special occasions.",

But I finally found this place and took the wife for her first cioppino. What a great one they had. They do it \"lazy\" style which means they take the crab meat out of the shell. Since my wife is pregnant, our waitress Sze Sze accommodated us by giving us more salmon instead of swordfish (most places usually just give you cod). The place is expensive but better than all the overpriced tourist traps around here.",

With a slightly dated but altogether charming interior, lined with pictures of celebrities who have once enjoyed the Scoma menu - it's bursting with character. We were seated quickly and were able to peer out at the docked boats gently lolling on the mellow water ripples. Seals even swam by with relaxed elegance as we dined.  Our waiter was suited in up in a formal white shirt and black pants. It was evident by the way he discussed the menu that he's been a fixture at Scoma's for awhile. We ended up getting a plate of the prawns and scallops - which came nestled beside creamy garlic mashed potatoes, seasoned rice, and steamed vegetables, the Petrale Dore, and the Broiled Wild Salmon. The salmon was incredible. Moist and paired nicely with the mashed potatoes and simple vegetables. The scallops and prawns were huge and exploding with flavor. The Petrale Dore was tasty - but it is served fish and chips style - so it was a tad heavy and greasy.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal, but moreover we enjoyed that we could hear each other talk and welcomed the quietness apart from the busy main wharf.  Highly recommend this fresh fish restaurant and would definitely love a return visit to enjoy their other acclaimed dishes such as Scoma's \u00a0\"Lazy's Man's\" Cioppino.  Trust.",

Wait time on a Saturday night around 9pm was 30 minutes, but well worth it. Really good clam chowder, really rich and flavorful. Lobster bisque pretty good too, but personally preferred the former. Got sauteed mixed seafood with linguini, where the seafood was amazingly tender and fresh. Portions not bad, while those for the cioppino are very generous; however it has a heavy tomato-based flavor, so if you're not a fan of tomatoes I would not recommend. Not sure if it's just me, but the complementary breads I've had in SF (including this restaurant) have been relatively hard, but I guess that's what sauce is for.   Best seafood I've had ever.",

The Alaskan halibut steak was great too, but the person who came to clear our dishes away threw away a big piece that we were gonna take home as leftovers. It was a sad moment, but I wasn't too sad at the time because I was drinking a well made maitai. The beer selection here is pretty standard. You should also know that there is no drink menu!

The food was excellent (as always), but the service was not up to the standard I am used to and the changes to the menu are equally disappointing. \u00a0Their prices have increased but the portions are smaller, the side selections have narrowed and are not up to the standard of their traditional rice pilaf and garlic mashed potatoes. The main dishes are still the highest quality and in the 15+ years I have been going there, I have never had a bad meal, but the 25 minutes between ordering my salad and getting it and the additional 15 waiting for the entree (while waiting the whole time to get a refill on my coffee), was unacceptable.

If I want someone to watch my calories for me, I'll get married. \u00a0When I go out to dine, I am looking for quality food and service. \u00a0I felt this was not what I received.

I dont care either way for scallops or shrimp (my friend left most of the scallops behind, and he loves scallops)- but the crab and lobster were delish. This comes with rice AND pasta- strange! - Apple crisp a la mode- sugary apple sauce was good and I ate this with the ice cream, after finding the apples were far too hard and spongy.

First off, it is super easy to get to, you pull your car up and they whisk it away for you for no charge (well, except a nice tip for the valet). This is definitely a plus for a \"tourist\" at the wharf to not have to worry about finding a place to park in a foreign city.  Now to the dining! My group had drinks at the bar as we waited (we were walk-ins and were accommodated with no problems, took maybe 10 minutes). Nothing special, waitstaff was helpful and informative regarding the local brews on tap.  Seated (party of 4) at a smallish table, albeit most tables at Scoma's are on the small side. The waitress was very energetic and was quite knowledgeable about any dish we asked about. I went with one of the specials, a seared, caught-that-morning Ahi tuna steak, served with a ginger reduction (complete with soy and wasabi), fantastically cooked (i mean perfect!) fresh veg, and smashed garlic potatoes. The tuna was skillfully seared and was very tasty; the accouterments creating an Asian flare. The sides were great, with the mash done with gusto and the normally forgettable vegetable side being an absolute stand-out.  My comrades also decided on one of the pescetarian specials. Two of them having the blackened halibut, again wit the fresh veg and garlic mash. The halibut was magnificent, envelope white and wonderfully flaky, with a meaty and fulfilling mouth feel.   All in all, my experience at Scoma's was a great one. My only regret is that I would have chosen a dish with a fish that has more inherent flavor. Don't get me wrong, tuna is good, but its flavor is not overt and I'm afraid the flavor of the fish itself was maksed by the heavier flavors of the meal's other players.  Needless to say, I'll be going there again!",

Onto the food! \u00a0For starters, you'll want to grab the infamous hearty man's cioppino. \u00a0It's stewy and hearty so be careful you don't tap out only on the first course. \u00a0With the complimentary bread, it's easy to fill up since the bread goes so well with that tomato soup base. \u00a0If you want to play it safe, split the cioppino with your date. \u00a0The other thing to try is the lobster bisque. \u00a0It's a love or hate thing so if you're not a fan of bisque, then don't get it. \u00a0I'm a fan of both bisque and lobster so it was a great starter for dinner. \u00a0It tastes like I'm sucking out the lobster entrails from it's body/shell/carapace! \u00a0The crab cakes were pretty good but small. \u00a0I wished they were just a tad bit bigger to be satisfying. \u00a0I won't go into detail for the main entrees since the appetizers were pretty good and talking further would ruin the good vibe already built up. \u00a0Only thing I can say is that the entrees are mediocre compared to the appetizers/soup.

    "review_text": "4.5 Stars  First let me say that there was many things that were not going in our favor in regards to eating here. \u00a0Like I do in many cities I visit I like to ask the locals the best place to eat. \u00a0Many times I get \"tourist\" places, but sometimes I get some good unique places. \u00a0This is definitely the former but the location and the building was pretty cool and made it look like a place that I may have never been before.   First, I don't think we (and my wife for sure) were looking for a \"fine dining\" place to eat. \u00a0More of just a good seafood joint. \u00a0When my wife saw the menu and the prices next to them she nearly fell off her chair. \u00a0She was so upset with how expensive it was she literally started crying. \u00a0I; however, was just looking for what I wanted to eat from what looked like a pretty righteous seafood place. \u00a0  This is where I look like a bad husband (but I partially redeem myself later I promise). I ordered the cioppino and the lobster bisque...she was so pissed off she ordered nothing. \u00a0I had little remorse...but I digress...  The whole time while the food was being prepared I was consoling her and assuring her that we were on vacation and we can go out to a nice meal. \u00a0When the food came I split everything I ordered with her (GO ME) and she had nothing to say but positive things about the food (However, when she looks back at this place she still doesn't think it was worth it).   I guess this is the part where I actually review the food (c'mon I had to set the mood). The cioppino was the best I have ever had. \u00a0The broth was very flavorful, but didn't take away from the freshness of the seafood. \u00a0It felt like there was literally pounds of seafood in this dish too. \u00a0The size of each piece of seafood was very impressive - and you can almost justify the price because of that. \u00a0The lobster bisque was great as well.  So yeah, its quite pricey (and crowded), but I would go back there to get the cioppino no questions asked, but I may need to sign the deed of my car over to get it.",

I have lived in the Bay area 35 of my 36 years and I finally went to the World Famous Scoma's in Fishermen's Warf for the first time. I had two items, a cup of clam chowder and the Shellfish Saut\u00e9.   Let's start with the clam chowder. Overall it was very good, but not my favorite. I am however not going to knock them because I can see why so many think it's one of the best. it was very flavorful and very dense. I personally prefer clam chowder that has less potatoes and veggies and is more about the clams. Probably the best chowder I've had yet was on the pier in Monterey, sorry the name escapes me. The waitress did bring me a little sample of the Lobster Bisque at Scoma's and my recommendation (unless you can't get chowder off the brain) is go for the bisque.  The Saut\u00e9 was absolutely amazing. Prawns, Scallops, Lobster, and Crab Legs Saut\u00e9ed with Onions, Mushrooms and Garlic in a White Wine and Butter Sauce served over a bed of rice with a small helping of pasta noodles and zucchini. This was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had, what's better is I could not finish it and had the rest for breakfast the next day.  I will not be passing by Scoma's without having them ever again. I fell in love!",

We ordered the Ciopinno (drool...) and the Mixed Seafood Grill (consisting of grilled shrimp, scallops, and salmon). We also ordered fried oysters and lobster bisque as starters. I'll begin with the fried oysters, which were fried perfectly. Breading was crispy like a panko breading, and the oyster was fried just enough to give it that crispy edge, but without drying the oyster itself out. The lobster bisque was on point, savory but not too salty.   Now, the Ciopinno was great; the tomato broth was a bit on the rich side, but not enough to cover the taste of the seafood. Mussels were cooked just right, soft and not rubbery. Scallops were amazing, and the fish was fantastic. The mixed seafood plate was amazing; their grilled shrimp was probably the best shrimp I've ever had. The seasoning was SO good, and the shrimp itself had that snap/crunch which all grilled shrimp should have. Salmon was perfectly cooked through; moist but not raw, and was seasoned well. Scallops were great too, as expected.   I'd recommend coming here for any special occasion. The staff is well trained, courteous and very accommodating should you have any special needs.",

    "review_text": "I have eaten at Scoma's in the past with mixed feelings. \u00a0So being in The City again I thought I'd take a friend and try it again. \u00a0Was close to our hotel and was raining so a close place was definitely in the cards. \u00a0No problem getting a booth overlooking the fishing fleet (which is really a bunch of charter boats that likely never leave the dock but, hey, it's Fisherman's Wharf so there had to be boats, right.?). \u00a0White table cloth Italian. I will say the service was very good. \u00a0Not hovering, knew when to leave one alone. \u00a0White jacketed waitstaff in a white table cloth restaurant. \u00a0Cool.! \u00a0As for the food.. \u00a0Well, it's crab season so I go with the Dungeness Crab Cocktail. \u00a0$18.. \u00a0One can do better at the walk up in front of Alioto's or Pompei's Grotto. \u00a0Crab was mostly flakes, was watery and the cocktail sauce so overpowering with horseradish that using it drowned what little taste of crab existed. \u00a0Friend had Caesar Salad. \u00a0She ate maybe 5 bites and pushed the rest around the plate. \u00a0Said it was mostly watery lettuce and tasteless. \u00a0On to dinner.!!! \u00a0Neither of us wanted fish so she has a Pasta Pomodoro. \u00a0Simple thin spaghetti, tomatoes, olive oil and garlic. \u00a0Looked terrible.. \u00a0Skins on the tomatoes and watery. \u00a0More small bites and food pushing.!! \u00a0I had a Penne Bolognese. \u00a0Waiter said it was made with \"really good cuts of meat.\" \u00a0OK, so I didn't know hacked up Italian sausage was considered \"really good cuts of meat.\" \u00a0 The sauce was thick enough and somewhat spicy where positives.. \u00a0However the penne was over cooked to the point of being pasty and bland. \u00a0I also thought it amazing that both mains arrived very quickly after ordering. \u00a0Hum, can you say \"pre-cooked/hot boxed/pre-fab.?\" \u00a0Price.. \u00a0When all was said and done with 1 drink each we ended up owing some $150. \u00a0Way over priced for the quality. \u00a0Look, I get the Wharf. \u00a0I get the tourists, shops full of junk, tee-shirts, etc. so I guess with the tackiness comes mediocre restaurant options under the disguise of \"high end SF dining.\" \u00a0So be warned.. \u00a0 Scoma's isn't great and not worth the price. \u00a0And please don't think it is representative of the quality of SF dining. \u00a0I tell my friends that it's hard to find a bad meal in The City unless, that is, you go to Scoma.!",

Definitely saves time and it's FREE! :)  Food-  Dungeness Crab Cakes on Watercress Salad - Crabcakes were crispy with small chunks of crab. Watercress salad was refreshing and complemented well.  Lantern Scallops and Fettuccine - Scallops were pretty small... Pasta was rich in flavor, but nothing to be amazed or wowed by.   Chocolate Brownie and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - Can't really mess up with this dessert.... but tasted delicious especially mixing the brownie with the ice cream!  Service was just OK.... but prices are definitely higher since you're at Fisherman's wharf. (This restaurant is definitely a tourist trap!) The restaurant was really packed that Saturday night. In my opinion, I don't think I'll be back just because I have had better seafood meals elsewhere.",

We had to wait about half an hour to get seated but we sat at the bar and sipped more Pinot Noir while we were waiting. When seated I ordered the combo sea food, calamari and oysters to start and more Pinot Noir, We then noticed the portions were very good for this type of restaurant. It's not Majiano's Italian Restaurant but it can be very filling. You can share the food if you are not a big eater which places you in an outstanding position. I am glad I found this place. This will be my great refuge from frugality of my earlier years when I can enjoy some good seafood and feel I deserve a treat once in a while. It's.

Large wine list. 4 different kinds were selected at our table and all were delicious.  Calamari for appetizer made the spicy way... Perfection!!!  Highlight of this meal... My dads CIOPPINO!!!! Omg!!!! Please. You must get this. This is the end all to be all.  My half baked crab was exquisite and garlicky, but if you are not willing to get cracking and stink like a shellfish the next 24 hours... I don't suggest it:) crab takes work!  A standout in this meal was my sisters lobster ravioli. Wow. Fresh lobster stuffed in pasta with a huge piece of salmon laid on top. Need I say more?  They have the best sourdough with EVOO for dipping..... Pair this with the huge bucket of cioppino \u00a0(it's seriously a huge portion) and you are set my friend.

Clam chowder was the best I ever had!!! there were tons of clams in there! and the crab salad was a favorite of san francisco, told by my waiter. I didnt believe him till I tried it! there were tons of crabs and it was so goood!!! Dressing was like a thousand island dressing.

It's pretty much a seafood only restaurant, but they do have some meat entrees, but lets be realistic, you order fish at Scoma's. All of the food is very, very fresh and I think it would be hard to go wrong with any seafood selection. Even still, the oysters rockefeller are outstanding and I recommend trying them. The portions are very generous, so be sure not to fill up on the sourdough bread... like I did.   Scoma's is a very good seafood restaurant, but be sure to get there early or expect to wait (no reservations).

It definitely looked way better than it actually was. Every bite was a disappointment. Although all the seafood were top notch fresh off the boat, I couldn't taste anything in the sauce.

Not too many potatoes, plenty of clams and celery and the soup isn't too creamy like most in SF. My girlfriend even said that it was better than Splash Cafe's clam chowder (in San Luis Obispo).  Main Courses Ordered: CIOPPINO ALA PESCATORE ($32) A San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf Original. Prawns, Shrimp, Clams, Sea Scallops, Fresh Fish, and a 1/2 Dungeness Crab cracked in the Shell in a rich tomato broth.  and my gf got the SCALLOPS SAUTE SEC ($30). She originally wanted the \"GRILLED SEA SCALLOPS RISOTTO - 30 Peas, Red Bell Peppers, Zucchini, &amp; Pancetta\", but the waitor told us that \u00a0only 3 scallops come with that and 12 come with the the saute, so she got the saute.  If you want the freshest seafood and the original SF landmark, this is the place to go! Scoma's owns its own fishing fleet and brings in fresh seafood daily. \u00a0Seeing how crowded it was on a sunday night with a full 420 capacity restaurant and STILL having to wait 20 minutes is amazing. It isn't even located in a great spot, yet you could tell...it is the place to be if you want the best seafood. Other reviewers say it is pricey, but for what you're ordering....and what you get, it is worth the money.   DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS THAT GIVE IT ANYTHING LOWER THAN A 5......THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT!  P.S. - TripAdvisor has Scoma's as one of the top Seafood restaurants in SF.",

    "review_text": "I came here this past weekend because my favorite restaurant (House of Prime) was all booked up.. This place doesn't take reservations but luckily we have a connection with one of the waiters and were able to score a table within 30 minutes.. Scoma's was packed from the time that we got there, 7, until the time that we left, 10, with a bunch of people still waiting for tables! From what I've been told it's normally like that but I'm guessing that the NFL Playoff game being in town didn't help the crowd control either :P.. So there were a bunch of rowdy New Yorkers present as well as the usual San Francisco/Bay Area crowd.. The waiting area of this restaurant is pretty narrow so expect to stand in a cramped area while you wait for your party to be called by a hostess who looks unhappy and gives you a fake smile when you enter or speak.. The bar is right by the entrance so that's a good way to dish out $10-12 per drink while you wait.. Probably the most annoying part of our wait was listening to a group of drunk New Yorkers (I do not dislike NYers just this particular group!) yell to each other across the bar.. This isn't Applebee's it's a fine dining restaurant so let's get it together guys!  Being that our family friend is a waiter at Scoma's he would naturally know what the best things to order are so we left this in his hands and offered a few suggestions for what our party of 7 likes.. For our first course we had 2 plates of clams and oysters on a bed of ice, calamari (mmm baby tentacles!!), garlic bread, shrimp cocktail, steamed clams, and a cup of clam chowder (packed with goodies!).. I didn't try the hard shellfish because I'm not really a fan of it raw or cooked except for in a few dishes.. The only time I tried the clam was when it was steamed and even then I just couldn't take to the taste or texture of it.. The shrimp cocktail came with jumbo prawns and was absolutely amazing, as well as the calamari and clam chowder.. The garlic bread was probably some of the best I've ever had and was flavorful, well textured, and warm.. My guests thoroughly enjoyed the shellfish platter and the steamed clams so I'm guessing that was good too! For our second course we had a platter with an assortment of seafood including sole, seared ahi tuna, scallops, and crab cakes.. Everything on this platter was delicious except I'm not very partial to scallops, especially raw, and these were only partially cooked (75% maybe).. The seared ahi tuna was the most impressive item that they brought out and I could've eaten it all night if my stomach allowed for it.. We also had spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, and steamed veges as sides with some seafood pasta.. I didn't get a chance to try the mashed potatoes but the veges and spinach were okay.. I don't generally like my veges steamed since the flavor can be quite bland.. By the time the pasta got to our table I was already quite full so I only tried some of the lobster tail that was in it.. Surprisingly this was my first time trying lobster, ever! And with my under developed palate for seafood, naturally, I wasn't that big of a fan, haha! I still enjoy crab now and then though [: For all of the above mentioned our bill came to ~$340 +18% gratuity and we didn't order and drinks once we were seated..",

    "review_text": "Mediocre, overpriced seafood at astronomical prices!! \u00a0  This place is old-school, in the sense that it's a flashback to the restaurants of yester-year: \u00a0white table cloth, aging male servers who are politely brusque, middle-aged tourists and older diners who have had too many cocktails and have gotten a bit too loud for the comfort of their neighboring tables, uninventive \"classic\" recipes that all too often remind us of just how far this country has come recently in terms of culinary creativity...and therefore how much of a dinosaur this restaurant really is.  My biggest objection: \u00a0The prices. \u00a0$15 for shrimp cocktail??? \u00a0$7 for garlic bread???? \u00a0$16 for a spinach and goat cheese salad????? \u00a0 And most offensively, $26 for penne bolognese???????  It would be one thing if the food really were exquisite, an explosion of new, creative flavors in your mouth, the sensation of \"oh my GAWD this is SO GOOD, I can't eat enough of it!!!\" \u00a0But that's not what I felt here. \u00a0Instead, as I dined on a fairly by-the-book Lobster Newburg ($36), I couldn't help but wonder why I was feeling so \"meh\" about lobster, ie, my FAVORITE FOOD IN THE WORLD!!! \u00a0It was just sort of...bland. \u00a0And why the steep prices? \u00a0The portions weren't large. \u00a0The boring ol' steamed veggies on the plate didn't lend me any clues. \u00a0And my friend's flacid pasta didn't give me any answers, either. \u00a0The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't exciting. \u00a0And since we weren't sitting near a window, and it was also nighttime, it's not like we were enjoying any exquisite view. \u00a0  And then I remembered: \u00a0I'm on Fisherman's Wharf. \u00a0I never go here, because it's famous for one thing, and one thing only: \u00a0tourism. \u00a0Aha. \u00a0So when someone comes to San Francisco and opens a guide book, they see Scoma's listed as being located in a tony location on the wharf in what all their not-from-San-Francisco friends tell them is the area of the city they simply MUST go see (because certainly there is NOTHING to do in SF unless you see Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf!!! \u00a0Ooo, don't forget to buy an Alcatraz t-shirt!!!! \u00a0Otherwise, how will people know you've been to SF?!). \u00a0And they suddenly rationalize paying $26 for an average bowl of pasta and meat sauce. \u00a0Because after all, there WAS a white table cloth, so certainly this MUST be a classy joint, a San Francisco landmark!  Listen, people: \u00a0if you want to experience really good Italian food and/or seafood, there are a ZILLION better restaurants in San Francisco to go to. \u00a0A little research will reward you with a dinner at a far more delicious (and reasonably priced!) restaurant in town! \u00a0Sure, you may not be able to buy an \"Alcatraz Triathalon\" t-shirt on your walk back to the hotel, but you'll have a far more genuine and exciting culinary journey if you venture outside of the Fisherman's Wharf bubble. \u00a0Scoma's might've been what spelled class to your grandparents back in the day, but nowadays we've come so far from over-priced entrees made up of protein, pasta, and a heap of limp, favorless steamed veggies....",

The walls are festooned with faded color photos of older people having good lives who are probably long dead.   I suspect the menu hasn't changed much in decades. Same old staff. Same old uniforms (service was fine though). A bit rain down, but not dirty.

First the atmosphere. \u00a0This is in a very touristy area and I wanted to avoid that. \u00a0The prices on the menu scare off the typical tourist, which is good.  The food was up there with the best restaurants in NYC. \u00a0My wife and I had different seafood and both were amazing. \u00a0A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.

When we arrived at Scoma's we did not have a reservation because we were travelling in from Concord, and did not know how long the drive would take. We waited at the bar for about fifteen minutes and then were seated in the renovated section of the restaurant overlooking the marina. It was a gorgeous view!  Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and shared that he had worked here for many years. My in-laws and husband all ordered the same thing. It was a seafood medley, so they could try a little bit of everything. I decided on the Dungeness crab and a side of French fries.   When they brought out our food, my crab was steamed in a garlic seasoning (which I did not order) but it smelled so good that I ate it anyways. While the garlic seasoning was incredibly messy, I loved the flavor it gave the crab. The French fries came in a massive order. My hubby and I split them, and even then we couldn't finish! \u00a0   Everything is fresh. You see them cleaning the seafood and fish in the building over when you walk by. Seeing that made me love Scoma's even more.   I would come back here in a heartbeat. Be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation. But, the food and atmosphere is worth it.",

I can appreciate the sort of kitsch factor of the place -- you can tell that in the 60s or 70s, this was *the* place to go... \u00a0but with the original wood paneling and fixtures and everything, plus the servers' boxy white waiter jackets, it all comes across like you're stuck in a time warp. \u00a0But again, I can totally appreciate it.  What I didn't appreciate, though, was the rotten service once we were seated at our table. \u00a0Someone brought us the bread basket, and then it was almost 20 minutes before our server came over to even greet us. \u00a0When he did, it was just a very short \"sorry 'bout the wait, what can I get you\". \u00a0All of our interactions with him were this way -- pretty much he'd just drop off the next course without saying a word and walk away. \u00a0When our desserts came (we did the 3-course prix fixe where dessert was included and ordered at the beginning), he didn't even ask if we wanted coffee. \u00a0It was obvious he just wanted to get us eating and get us out... \u00a0which was confirmed when we were outside waiting for the valet to bring our car, and we saw him put his coat on and head home. \u00a0Now, I totally get that people have lives and everything... \u00a0but it doesn't add extra time to your shift to smile, ask how our meal is, etc. \u00a0Goodness. \u00a0I've had service 10x better at a TGI Friday's, for half the price.  The food itself was pretty decent -- my arancini appetizer (3 risotto balls rolled in bread crums and quick-fried) was piping hot, the risotto was cheesy and gooey... \u00a0the entree of giant grilled prawns over pasta was a little bland but the prawns were grilled perfectly. \u00a0and the dessert of a small brownie served with a scoop of ice cream and caramel sauce was good to satisfy a need for something sweet, but the brownie was rather dry. \u00a0My co-workers got the swordfish entree and cheesecake dessert and enjoyed them.  In a nutshell, it's worth going to for the old-school seafood restaurant experience... \u00a0just hope you get a different server than we had.",

    "review_text": "so my boss recommended this place based solely on their famous cioppino. Being italian i was intrigued, i'm from Boston and love seafood. I'm also italian and love italian food. Combining both was bound to be good. I was not disappointed!  First, this place is expensive. The bill for the soup alone came to around $50. But high cost does not diminish the experience. Scoma's is a CLASSIC place, the kind of place you want to take your wife on special occasions. Places like that are worth it.  Second, the ambiance is old town San Francisco from the North Beach of the 1960's. This is a place that the wise guys used to come for the best food around. I was most definitely in my element.   Third, the food... WOW. As soon as I ordered the cioppino Salvatore advised me that I didn't need to order anything else. Now I can eat but I got a little nervous about the breadstick i had eaten. When the food arrived I realized Salvatore was right, this was a huge bowl of seafood with a big slice of garlic bread. But having walked to the restaurant through the cold and wind i was ready. In fact that made it better, warm soup on a cold day. The broth was heavenly, i sipped most of the broth before I started on the fish. Now most fish in soups gets a little tough as it cooks. Somehow this fish was incredibly tender, the cod, the scallops, the clams and shrimp, it was all delicious.  Lastly, the people. Everyone was awesome! Salvatore was a true professional. Salvatore was hard working, knowledgeable, friendly. I was very lucky to have him as a server. Then the chef, Donnie Grey, came out and talked to me about the cioppino. Donnie was a great guy, very down to earth and friendly. He treated me like I was a celebrity!  Scoma's is a four star restaurant and a San Francisco landmark! I would highly recommend it if you're visiting with someone special and you want a romantic night out or you want to celebrate a special occasion....or if you just want GREAT food and service. i know I will be back whenever I am in San Francisco again.",

I've been avoiding swordfish because of its previous avoid status on the Seafood Watch list, but our very competent waiter assured me this swordfish was handline caught, and I succumbed. One of my non-fish-loving dining companions was sorry that she'd ordered the mediocre steak instead of the swordfish. The other orders at my table included a decent pasta dish and a crab risotto, and both diners were quite happy with their orders. The bread slices were huge and really good. Next time I'll avoid the bread basket, lol, because half of my swordfish came home with me for lunch. :-) If you don't like seafood this is probably not the best place to eat.

Arriving around 6pm Sat., we were a group of 5. \u00a0As they do not take reservations we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. \u00a0I had a deliciously dark draft beer to make the time fly faster.  When we finally started I had some perfectly prepared Crab Cakes. \u00a0Followed by a stellar Shell Fish Saute. \u00a0It included shrimp, scallops, small lobster tails, crab, steamed Cauliflower, manicotti, and risotto. \u00a0 Finally the Tiramisu was served with the Marscapone, some Lady Fingers, Coffee/Choc. mousse in a cup and a solid Chocolate Spoon on top. \u00a0Whipped cream and extra lady fingers where served on the side...delicioso!  It was good but for $60 per person with tip, not worth the price, so only 3 stars.",

This is definitely more of a touristy place than a restaurant that actually serves great food. My biggest pet peeve is when \"nice\" restaurants serve cold almost stale looking bread with cold butter. As a first impression it's well not impressive. The food isn't well presented for a place that's $$$. The mushroom/dungeness crab appetizer looked like it was overcooked and the vegetables in my lobster risotto seemed like they could have come out of a frozen bag from the grocery store. Not a place I would recommend.",

The Cioppino is what everybody talks about, but I have also enjoyed a number of entrees ranging from the catch of the day to steak. \u00a0The oysters are fresh, the prawn cocktail is huge, and the lobster ravioli is really good.

    "review_text": "An old school San Francisco seafood restaurant, Al Scoma's place on the wharf continues to shine even after 50 years.  While the worn red carpet and wood paneled walls hung with faded photographs of famous visitors seemingly haven't been updated from since the 1970s, the d\u00e9cor is just what one would expect from a longstanding San Francisco landmark. \u00a0The location right not he water cannot be beat.  The expansive menu has something for everyone, even those that shy away from seafood. \u00a0That being said, the dishes that feature the bounty of the ocean really shine at Scoma's. \u00a0  With a light vinaigrette, the organic baby spinach salad ($16) with bacon, hard boiled egg, and tomatoes was a great way to start the meal. \u00a0Sweet and creamy, the butternut squash soup ($13) topped with chunks of local Dungeness crab was delicious. \u00a0Hearty and chock full of scallops, shrimp, crab, and fish, Scoma's \"lazy man's\" cippino ($39) is large enough for two and still leaves some to take home. \u00a0Fresh from the boat, the whole steamed Dungeness crab ($MP) is sweet and succulent. \u00a0The meal is accompanied by a seemingly endless supply of warm, freshly baked sourdough bread, butter, and olive oil.  Friendly and attentive, service is excellent. \u00a0Dressed in cropped white jackets, white shirts, and black ties, the waiters (nearly all are men) are classic. \u00a0Be sure to consult your server before ordering, as they are supremely knowledgeable of the menu and can direct you to selections that are sure to please. \u00a0Scoma's has a full bar as well as a nice, reasonably priced selections of wine by the glass and by the bottle.  With tasty seafood fresh from the boat, there is a reason why Scoma's has been a San Francisco seafood go-to for 50 years.",

    "review_text": "I have been a San Francisco resident since 1986 and was first taken to Scoma's back in 1989. My first impression of the local restuarant tucked back in Al Scoma's Way was one of wonder. How cool it was to find a piece of \"old San Francisco\" hidden among the touristy confines of the Wharf. After my first meal at Scoma's I was hooked. I came back often and nine times out of ten I would order the blackened salmon. It became one of my favorite restuarants in SF and even had many of my \u00a0birthday dinners at my \"favorite\" spot.   But things have changed.....  A couple of years ago I knew the end was near when Scoma's replaced its bound menus to a one page laminate. The menu had been replaced and was scaled back. But the food was still excellent and I saw no reason to complain.  Until now......  Took a date my to old \"favorite\" restuarant last night. I talked it up all the way to our seated table. But once the food arrived I was sorerly disappointed. Gone was one of my favorite places to dine. Chalk it up to another place in disappearing San Francisco. My date and I shared the trio appetizer for two......it was disappointing but still looked forward to the main dishes. I couldn't wait to get my blackened salmon! My date ordered the once famous shellfish saut\u00e9. When it arrived It looked nothing like it did back when Scoma's cared about presenting quality dishes. My blackened salmon was an even bigger bummer. The size of my fish was a third the size it used to be. And it wasn't even blackened......the waiter offered to have it blackened but after I saw what was to come I thought to myself why even bother.   It just sucks forking over $150.00 (including a couple of cocktails) on mediocre food at best. What was once one of my favorite places to take my out of town friends and myself is no more. I have spoken to many other of my local friends and they all agree. Scoma's is no longer the restuarant that it used to be. And I will miss it. Giving it two stars solely on the great memories I had there.",

The clam chowder is, of course, brilliant seeing as it is near the wharf. What more could you possibly want?  Oh yeah, that's right. You might want a fucking table!  It doesn't matter what time of day you go. The place has so many damn tourists that it's impossible to get a table if you go anywhere near a normal meal time. There will be about half-hour waits on off hours (like 3pm) and usually an hour and a half to two hour wait at dinner and on weekends. More than that, the place is horrible for odd numbered tables. They will try to shove 3 people at an obviously two person table instead on conceding the extra seat at a 4 person table.  Yes, the food is great, but I don't want to spend more time waiting for a table than I spend eating my meal. No matter who you're with (and I was with my best friend for this dinner) the wait just isn't worth it. I would come back over and over again if only they took reservations.",

It has a sort of old-school vibe to the decor.   Service was just okay. \u00a0Our waiter said they had a full bar and asked if we wanted a drink. \u00a0After walking through the crowds, that is exactly what we wanted! \u00a0I wasn't into the drink list and tried to order a Dark'n'Stormy which their bartender had never heard of it. \u00a0I found rather odd if they have a full bar but was good sticking to the menu. Our waiter really pushed the pre-fixed lunch menu saying it was a good value. \u00a0I was a bit hesitant but he said it had Scoma's best items. \u00a0We went for it, but in the end I am not sure if it was the right call. Also, at the end of our meal, we felt rushed as it appeared to be shift ending time.  The food was good and fresh. \u00a0Their clam chowder was very good and probably my favorite item. \u00a0I ordered the Combo Crab &amp; Shrimp Louis salad and my husband ordered the fish of the day (halibut). \u00a0The Crab &amp; Shrimp Louis was very fresh and I can see why it is a popular item. My biggest complaint is that I had shell pieces and quite frankly expect better from a restaurant of this quality. My husband's halibut was fresh, perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. \u00a0However, the cheddar polenta that was served with the fish was a bit heavy and didn't seem to fit with the dish. The raspberry desert cake was excellent and not too sweet.   With the service and pre-fixed menu choice, I am not sure we had the chance to really get the best taste of Scoma's.",

SF has so many great trendy restaurants as well as authentic ethnic food...and Scoma's is where you go when you're not in the mood for either of those things. It's just a very classic restaurant with good service and good food. The give you endless sourdough bread with butter (that's actually room temp, which is a nice touch!) and the menu has an abundance of seafood standbys. I had the lobster bisque (so so good!) and the crab cakes (also excellent) and my husband had a whole crab. We really enjoyed our food, although we both left absolutely stuffed! Don't let the touristy exterior/repuation/location fool you, this is a great place to go if you just want normal, classic seafood done right!",

If this place got a revamp, it would be so much better!  Ordered the lobster bisque, forgettable. Okay, honestly I don't even remember the name of the entree I got which is really sad considering I remember almost everything I eat. This is how forgettable the food was. I just remember it being overcooked fish with different sauces and broth that were all mixed together with some vegetables plopped around it. The dessert was not good - got the brownie.  Would never come back here, but the reason for 3 stars instead of 2 was for the service. The waiter we had was incredibly sweet. Although he didn't really pay attention to us, he was really nice when he did. It was a very casual and comfortable dining experience that I can see regulars coming in and ordering their favorites. The view is pretty nice, and the location is great if your'e a tourist and want to go walk around the pier aftewards. Okay, just to give you an idea about the unsatisfaction of this 3 course meal, I bought a whole steamed crab from the pier after and ate it all.",

    "review_text": "I honestly can't think of anywhere else in San Francisco to get fresh seafood cooked to perfection! Perhaps Tadich Grill on California St. puts up a good fight with Scoma's but other than that, I don't know where else to go. Suggestions?   FRIED CALAMARI (appetizer) I love how the calamari comes out tangy, with a crispy fried crust. The calamari itself is soft, and the two dipping sauces (tartar and cocktail) go so well with the fried calamari. I usually mix the tartar and the cocktail sauces together to get a better consistency since I think the tartar sauce resembles mayo TOO much and the cocktail sauce can be on the watery side.   PASTA ALLA SCOMA (linguini and clams) I'm sorry, Scoma's. But I had so much better linguini and clams in Venice! Something about that dish hasn't been topped yet. I'm still on a search for a good linguini and clams dish but the one I had here was decent. I had about 30 clams on my plate. I definitely had more clams than pasta, which is a good because I'm getting what I paid for, but I was also craving pasta. I would recommend this dish for someone who isn't a big seafood fan, but would like to try something new.   CIOPPINO We didn't get the lazy man style where the crab was out of it's shell and we should have paid $3 more for it. They give you 2 crab legs plus that big part of the crab and it's still all in the shell. I think it would have been easier to eat had it been shelled for us. Oops. Oh well, now we know. The sauce to this cioppino was good -- not too tangy and not too sweet. I love the bread that comes with this because it's nicely grilled and it's way oily. It's definitely goes well dipped in the cioppino soup, YUM!   There are two complaints I do have about this place: 1. No reservations for SUCH a classy restaurant. Sure we wore jeans and a tank top to dine here but you would think such a fine establishment would take reservations. They tell you to stay at the bar until your name is called. I'm guessing that's a good tactic to reel in more profits but that's at such a disadvantage to your customers since they have to WAIT for a table. Sigh! I do have to add that Eddy (Asian man with a comb-over makes an excellent Fruit Punch -- no alc) -- GET IT! 2. As the server was refilling my water cup, he accidentally poured a bit of water on my camera, realized it, then swiftly walked away. He didn't even acknowledge that he did something wrong. I was half fuming, but stayed calm because of the good food I was devouring. Plus, the water only hit the shell of my camera, not the lens (THANK GOD).   I'm definitely returning to Scoma's but if a server pours water on my camera again, I will be livid (that might be an understatement).",

Bone-in Cowboy Steak. This was good and even though this place is known for seafood, this steak was good, no A1 needed. Just the Gratin potatoes and bacon-bourbon butter with every bite of steak was enough.   I guess this would be the best restaurant on the wharf so far, but overall it's average.",

Several guys had the awesome looking \u00a0\"Lazy Man's\" Cioppino which others have commented - you best be VERY hungry or consider splitting this dish. \u00a0They are not kidding. \u00a0No one was able to finish this dish! \u00a0I opted for a cup of Bisque and then the mixed grilled seafood. \u00a0The Bisque was great but the mixed grilled seafood was just OK. I was disappointed with the inclusion of french fies with a grill dish of this caliber (guess I'll read the menu closer next time). \u00a0 \u00a0My second choices were the Seared Tuna or the awesome sounding Seafood Salad which I'd get next time. \u00a0Overall, Scoma's is a nice place to visit to have some really really fresh seafood while avoiding most of the touristy side of the Wharf. \u00a0 They also have nice parking arrangements for those daring to drive. \u00a0Overall good, but be prepared, their pricing is on the upper side of the seafood scale but the experience and service is well executed.

Others at the table had other things (there's a lot of pasta on the menu, which seems odd for a place on the Bay). \u00a0The best prepared dish was the seared Ahi, which wasn't very interesting palate-wise, but was cooked exactly to order.  The interior is acceptable, with lots of \"Look who ate here!\" shots on the wall. \u00a0The exterior is awful... looks like you're eating in a shack. \u00a0 Oh, and it's a bit of a pain to get to if you're walking the wharf.  3rd star is really just for having an edible cioppino. \u00a02 1/2 otherwise.",

We made reservations which is a must as the place attracts a large crowd. Has a good location right on the pier so if you are lucky to get a table near a window, its fun to gaze at the docked boats. Wait staff was definitely old school which matched the decor in the restaurant but friendly and informative.   Our meals were good and a hefty. We definitely were not blown away as all the hype made it seem, but overall a good place and worth checking out for a good seafood plate.",

For my entr\u00e9e, I went with the Acqua Pazza, which consisted of mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, fish, and tomatoes in a light, aromatic broth. It was a really nice, refreshing dish that's perfect for the summer time. One of my dining companions ordered the cioppino, which came loaded with seafood in a thicker tomato-based broth. When she failed to finish off the cioppino, I gladly volunteered to finish off the rest of it. There was a ton of seafood, and I made sure to get some extra bread to sop up as much of the sauce as I could fit in my stomach.  Great seafood, good service, and reasonable prices - there's not much not to like about Scoma's.",

    "review_text": "I cannot praise this place enough. I hadn't tried crab before Scoma's, so I will always treasure it as the place where I fell in love with Dungeness crab. All I have to say about the experience is OH. DEAR. GOD. There are no words to express the surge of joy that coursed through my body when I took that first bite of tender, sweet crab meat dipped in drawn butter. It was perfectly cooked and the freshness was unparalleled. Conveniently, they give you a bib imprinted with the Scoma's logo to protect yourself against the spray of crab juice, as well as a warm cloth with lemon to clean your hands when you're finished. Others in my party also raved about the lazy man's cioppino, and being Italian, I trust their opinion about cioppino.  The first time I was here I had a steak and didn't think it was anything to write home about. They say you shouldn't go to a steak house and order seafood, and unsurprisingly the reverse is also true. Their beef is obviously not as fresh as their fish, which I believe is caught daily. It's not often you'll get to eat seafood that fresh.  Yes, it's pricey, but not prohibitively so. It's worth it for the quality and quantity of food you get. The portions are decent, neither too much nor too little, and $26 for a whole crab is definitely reasonable. The service is average in speed, but they make up for it in friendliness and professionalism. They always have a knack for suggesting the best thing when you ask what they recommend. They're almost always busy because they don't accept reservations, so be prepared to kill some time at the bar. The ambiance is fantastic, and being on the pier, the view is even better. I don't know what it is, but there's something about the decor that makes you feel swanky. Don't come here in jeans if you can help it.  \"Died and gone to heaven\" is an understatement. If you don't visit this place before you die, you will regret it, I promise.",

I found our last full day, a Monday, we had availability so I found a 4:00 time and worked our schedule for the day around it. \u00a0Glad I did. We started at the bar 1st for an early cocktail (it's 6:30 back east where we live!), my wife having a blue cheese stuffed olive martini, and I opted for a glass of Zin. \u00a0My wife raved about the martini and my wine was quite tasty. When we were ready, we were seated at a table with a view of the back dock. Nothing overly scenic, but better than looking at a wall. \u00a0We order a bottle of wine, and while uncorking it the server went over the menu, offering \u00a0her opinions and suggestions. \u00a0We usually share dishes so we can experience more tastes, so we ordered the Lobster Bisque and the Oyster Rockefeller alla Scoma to start. \u00a0 We decided on the Mixed Seafood Grill and the Alaskan Halibut Siciliana for our entr\u00e9e's.  The Bisque was good (I'm not a big bisque fan anyway, so 'good' is a compliment) but the Oysters were out of this world. \u00a0Made me wish I didn't have to share them. Yummy. Then came the entr\u00e9e's; \u00a0Both were delicious. \u00a0The Mixed Grill was plentiful, so much so that my wife couldn't finish it all, but did manage to leave no shrimp or lobster behind. \u00a0My Halibut Siciliana was so flavorful I didn't leave anything behind. Our server (change of shift, seamless) tried to temp us with desert, and he was successful. \u00a0I judge places based on their Tiramisu against my favorite back home (I won't give away the name of that place) and considered whether I wanted to risk souring my overwhelmingly favorable opinion of \u00a0the early evening's dining experience, but decided to go for it. \u00a0He also told us of a Chocolate Torte that wasn't on the menu, so we order that too. \u00a0The Tiramisu exceeded my expectations and the Torte just made it hard to declare a winner, so we called it a tie. What a wonderful dining experience. The food and the service are top notch. So glad we decided to fit this into our schedule. We had some great food during our week in SF, but I think we saved our best experience for last!",

    "review_text": "I think my favorite line was from our waitress that day, \"....and those are our specials. And of course, there's our famous clam chowder.\" Nice try, but I'm an SF native who actually worked at Fisherman's Wharf &amp; Pier 39 as a teenager and EVERYBODY says that about their clam chowder when in fact, most of it comes frozen and then re-cooked in a large pot. For a real bowl of clam chowder, try Hog Islands.   When a friend a mine told me she wanted to her birthday luncheon at Scoma's at Fisherman's wharf, I was a little skeptical because of the fact that it's on Fisherman's Wharf. Everything on that strip is a tourist trap. And Scoma's is just that, a tourist trap. Equipped with okay food, high prices and the ambiance similar to an old Elk's Lodge. The wait staff was pleasant, but I expected something with more personality. Yea, I get tradition but I think Joe's Crab Shack might have more ambiance than Scoma's.   Ambiance: Old, maybe somewhere I'd go with my grams and gramps. Conservative. You can argue its on a dock but Fisherman's Grotto in Monterrey is also on a dock and they serve flavorful food and it had a livelihood about them that Scoma's didn't.   Food: Bland. I have to give them credit for their scallops. They were tasty and did have flavor. Went well with the mash. But the veggies on the side were so uninspired and had no flavor. I mean they were really sorry looking to the point I'd compare them to hospital food. The clam chowder was good for my tummy but at the end of the day, its not the best and it wasn't too different from what you would get else where.   Service: They were polite.   Conclusion: At the end, the bill came out to be $30ish for Dine About Town. If I had to pay their regular prices for their \"meh\" dishes, I'd probably be pissed. Sorry Scoma's, you didn't do it for me.",

They don't take reservations, so just get your name on the list and grab a few drinks at the bar or walk around while you wait. They overestimated our wait time, lucky for us, but it was still about an hour around 8 or 9pm on a Friday.   Our waiter, Sal, was great.

Food... Yeah seafood is the way to go. I have no comments on the red meat here because frankly I don't see why you'd want that at a seafood place on the pier. The chowder is pretty tasty, and it's more creamy than it is full of large seafood bits. The warm appetizer trio had good calamari and crab cakes. The shrimp was fine too but not super amazing. The swordfish fagioli is a solid dish - also has some pancetta and leafy greens. I loved my seafood mix saut\u00e9 plate, which was not only HUGE but very tasty, tons of large crabmeat pieces, 2 1/2 lobster tails, about 4 large scallops and at least 2 or 3 shrimp on top of a bed of rice + pasta (not sure why there was both) plus lots of veggies.

But I had hoped to have better service (it was friendly, but always a long wait just to get drinks and make sure everything is OK after getting food). \u00a0 the cioppino was stocked FULL of fresh seafood and the scallops, in particular, were fresh, HUGE, and tasty. The problem with the cioppino was the think, tomato 'sauce'. \u00a0I had hoped to have cioppino like Tadich Grill - where the broth doesn't overpower the fresh seafood. \u00a0More of a water-based broth. \u00a0But their cioppino is think like a sauce. \u00a0It took away from the wonderful seafood and made the dish much heavier than it should have been.  All in all, probably one of the better places to eat along the wharf, but I prefer Tadich Grill for cioppino.",

    "review_text": "I came here with my family and was told to wait about 30 minutes, which we expected. I had the crabcakes and the pasta diplomatica, and the rest of the family had the risotto and the lamb with clam chowders. Overall, the food was great. My pasta was light and delicious. The seafood in the pasta was a lot for me to handle, but for the rest of the family the food was adequately portioned.   The quality of food is okay, not super great or amazing. My family thought that compared to price, the food could have been better. But it's a tourist attraction and I don't blame the restaurant for this. But I do have to compliment their chowder and crab cakes. They were very good and after trying out a lot of the chowders in the area, i can say that this was one of the better ones. same goes for the latter.  The service was also very friendly. He was very attentive, kept good conversation, and was very genuine throughout the meal.   However, the one star I took off was due to something that happened towards the end of the meal. It was not directly related to us, but it was a bit distracting in a bad way. Apparently one of the other waiters could not find the tip that was on a table next to us. The guests had already left and the table was already cleaned. He kept looking for it, and asked one of the \"busboys\" if he had taken it. I dont really know what happened but the waiter got pretty angry and kept flipping through the tablecloths. Then he said to the \"busboy\" \" youre not getting paid tonight.\" Maybe I didn't comprehend the full situation, but for him to say that in the middle of where all the guests are that loudly made me frown. He kept saying \"where is my money?\" And the repetition bothered me and the guests around us.   For a restaurant that is supposed to be renowned for its class and service, it was surprising to hear such things.   But our waiter fortunately was very nice til the end and we were generally satisfied. Would not come back because of the price which we just considered a bit overkill, but I would still recommend it to others. Nice restaurant!!",

    "review_text": "Breathtaking! What an incredible dining experience!!  My Fiance and I came stumbled upon this restaurant during a recent trip into San Francisco. I had previously heard about Scoma's through various blogs, news articles, etc but had never ventured on to try it. As we docked from our bay cruise, our stomachs started to talk and we went searching for dinner. After speaking with a few locals on the street, they each RAVED about Scoma's! We took the bait . . .  Tucked behind every other restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf lays Scoma's, which is actually on a receiving dock. We didn't let looks fool us, the reviews we heard we too incredible to miss. Any place with raves of this magnitude is bound to have a wait, and our experience was no exception. We sat in one of their three bars, where we were served a couple of the best drinks of our lives! A perfectly created Mojito and an excellent Old Fashioned.   The time (30 minutes) passed quickly as the crowds began to swarm. We discovered this is a very popular destination with locals! We moved upstairs into a comfy booth with, as you could expect, glorious views of the SF Bay. I couldn't begin to tell you how many people worked at this restaurant! Each person had a specific duty, whether just pouring water, setting the table, bringing bread, serving drinks, busing, etc. The service at Scoma's is EXCELLENT! You will have a difficult time finding better service anywhere.  Our waiter, and any of the waiters we saw, was extremely professional and knowledge about the dishes, preparation, and ingredients served. Scoma's only uses local produce and wild-caught seafood. This dedication to quality is reflected in their prices, which are extremely high. Several dishes pushed $50 but most seemed to fit the $30 - $40 range. We were warned about this by folks we chatted with but I was on a date with my Fiance, celebrating seven years together, and had saved up for months for the day - she deserved the best and she certainly received it!  We each opted for Scoma's \"Triple Play\" menu. A daily menu featuring chef creations with the best of their available ingredients. For only $39.99, you received an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Here is what we enjoyed: (My Fiance) Roasted Butternut Squash and Dungeness Crab Soup with Toasted Pumpkin Seeds &amp; Creme Fraiche Garnish, Broiled Colossal Prawns on Linguine Pomodoro with Pesto, and a Walnut Brownie &amp; Triple Espresso Ice Cream with Caramel Sauce. (Me) Lobster Bisque with Lobster Salad and Chive Aioli, Broiled Wild Swordfish with Sicilian White Beans, Pancetta, Tomatoes &amp; Organic Rainbow Chard, and a Tiramisu &amp; Sourdough Bread Pudding Duo. \u00a0  I could go on and on about each dish but you'd be here for the next 20 minutes reading when you could be in the car on your way to Scoma's to try it yourself! I will tell you each dish was beautifully presented, with the perfect marriage of flavors and seasonings. The chefs at Scoma's have a magic touch - this food simply melts in your mouth!   If you are looking for the perfect culinary experience, complete with friendly, professional, and knowledgeable service and savory sensations you'll be raving about for weeks, Scoma's is where you want to be . . .",

I asked our waiter about the lobster(s) and he said that they never put them in there. Leads me to believe that he has not been there long enough to even give me a better answer. I started complaining again, this time, there was no lobster. I was a bit disappointed. However the dismay, this place is classic, the food is great, the service is wonderful and ambiance is oh so old school style. \u00a0The food is tasty with variety in the menu they prepare. \u00a0 The dining area a bit tight as they try to cram as much people in such a little space (but this is San Francisco). I would have given them 5 stars, however, stirring for lobsters in your meal to find them not even on the bottom of the bowl is a bit disturbing.",

Pleasant and courteous bartender - we got our drinks and immediately were escorted to a window-front table looking into the immediate harbor.

I ordered the whole crab garlic it was delicious but I would say that it totally falls on the greasy side (especially with the cup of melted butter they gave me to dip the crab meat in). I also had the lobster bisque- it was the best lobster bisque i've ever had.  Personally, I would totally go back for more of that famous lobster bisque :)  My husband got the crab salad- It was huge! He wanted something light but ended up with gigantic salad topped with crab (a lot of crab)!!!!  The service was not amazing- the waiter keeps refilling our water ever 5 minutes for some reason (we were really annoyed that he came to our table every 5 minutes).   Overall, Scoma's was ok. It was kind of noisy and touristy but the experience was fun!",

(Sorry, one too many ciapet commercials!)  We walked up to the hostess desk and put our names on the list. It's a 45 minute wait. But hey, it's Friday night, so no surprise, right? There's a bar to kick it at and occupy our time, while we wait. Our friendly bartender joked with us, as we ordered our drinks. For me, it was the Malbec from Argentina, later to be followed by the Prosecco di Congliano. Both lovely choices.  Conveniently enough, after we finished our 2nd drink, it was time for dinner. The seating area is tight and intimate. Our server was exceptionally on his A-game. My girlfriend and I split the Caesar salad and the cioppino. Our other friend ordered the pasta diplomatica.  Let me tell you something. I was pretty apprehensive about having the cioppino because it was a tomato base soup. Me and tomato anything, at night, is definitely going to lead to some kind of tummy rebellion. But, since my girlfriend strongly suggested it and we were splitting a plate, why not give it a whirl?  The cioppino all pescatore was absolutely, wonderfully DELICIOUS! A light tomato base soup with clams, scallops, prawns, fish and crabmeat. Every bit of it was a tender morsel to savor and cooked to perfection. Served with a chunky piece of garlic toast, I used it to soak up every last drop at the bottom of my bowl, after my 2nd serving. Yes, I said 2nd serving.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy an awesome seafood experience. All our dishes were delicious, extra thumbs up for the cioppino. Definitely worth the splurge. \u00a0And, even though my stomach battled it out with the tomato-y goodness, I would definitely have cioppino, again, in a heartbeat. Or, should I say in a heartburn? \u00a0;o)",

There is an intercom outside so you can hear when they call your name which is nice so you don't have to just sit around inside doing NOTHING.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant next to the window with a nice outside view. We get a round of drinks and then start with a half dozen oysters on the half shell. These were very good! Personally I can't really taste the difference between different oysters but I know when they are BAD. And these weren't.  Next we move onto the whole Dungeness Crab! We get it steamed plain (you can get garlic steamed or something too) and it is served with warm drawn butter. I usually don't use butter with my crab but I did this time and it was QUITE delicious!! Half of the crab was cracked so it made it VERY easy to eat and the other half wasn't for some reason... I would have given FIVE stars if it had been.

Also note where the god damn restaurant is. It's in a narrow alley behind a bunch of tourist shops for godsakes. It's not supposed to be super uppity. It might as well be a gathering place for old fishermen who enjoy the finer things in life, so if you're super trendy be wary!   However, diners should also note that it has nice white table cloths and equally shiny and white plates. It's somewhere in between fine and casual but definitely San Franciscan. But hey, I'm not stupid enough to go on a weekend night.  Now down to business. My first experience and best experience was with the cioppino. Good Lord, it had so much seafood, they really don't skimp. I've had a lot of cioppino and this one takes the cake. Fish in every bite. And incredibly fresh (except maybe for the baby Alaskan shrimp, but hey shrimp in every bite) The individual pieces of \u00a0petrale, mussels, clams, and prawns weren't overcooked at all. Which means the cooks know when to put the fish in. \u00a0It's not just tossed into the broth. Heavenly, broth I might add. And it's all served with a delicious and I mean delicious buttery piece of toast.  But the best thing is Scoma's doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It's behind the tourist shops. Down a smelly little alley. It's San Francisco and it's how they cook there seafood. And if you want your fish served in fusion cuisine contorted into a roll slathered with mayo in a more \"hip\" environment--well there's those kinds of places in the 7mile by 7 mile city too. Just not here.   So yes, the service might be a little slow. But your server more likely than has been there for 20+ years. Have mercy and just enjoy your fish.",

While there we were seated in a corner wedged between 2 tables with wheelchairs. This is really my only complaint for the whole evening because it felt cramped. The service was good, but not spectacular. I went with the crab risotto because it's crab season and I didn't feel like wrestling with the Dungeness crab legs and I wasn't disappointed. It was creamy with good flavor and generously sprinkled with crab throughout. The others in my party had dishes with prawns and they both raved about their dishes.

I was raised in the North Beach part of the city and so Fishermen's Wharf was in the neighborhood. Scoma's has been around for many years and has a certain reputation. I think it lives up to that.   I've learned that this is one of the restaurants where it's great fun to eat off the appetizer and pasta parts of the menu.   I'll just list the items I've tried and enjoyed in the past. \u00a0Dungeness crabcakes with Remoulade suace is excellent, as well as the calamari fritti, which to me is the best in the city. Grilled sea scallops risotto is memorable too. They usually have them fresh so make sure of that. Even though caesar salad is a restaurant staple, Scoma's is unique. As far as pastas go, try the lobster ravioli which is quite rich but great. Also the pasta pesto. Most of the other pastas are good too. As I said, I don't usually eat off the entree part of the menu, but their Cioppino Alla Pescatore is the best thing on the whole menu. Talk about Italian comfort food. On return trips to Scoma's you could also try the grilled local sand dabs with Amandine sauce or grilled Alaskan King salmon on crab ravioli.   I realize that Scoma's is expensive but if you want to have the best fish in the city, then this is the place, served perfectly with a great choice of wines. Of course the restaurant has a lot of charm and warmth as well.",

I asked the server for more sauce and they basically just brought a bowl of canned mashed tomatoes. Ragu sauce would have been a huge upgrade.  Dessert - lemon panna cotta - Okay, tasted more like cheesecake because it was so dense.

It wasn't bad, but the quality seems to have down graded and the flavour &amp; freshness were average. I dont expect average from an upscale restaurant. \u00a0The menu items are typical of a seafood restaurant. Expect good/decent seafood, but don't expect gourmet and creative. \u00a0  The restaurant has an older, outdated feel - it needs updating. On the other hand, the waitress went the extra mile to check all the ingredients in my mother in laws meal and make sure there wasn't chili in her meal. When she found that there may be chili in the cocktail sauce, she quickly created an alternative solution. Good service and nice location on the water.",

    "review_text": "Wandering around fisherman's wharf, doing the tourist thing, I stopped to ask some charter fishing boatsmen for a good place to eat, where there would be quality food, and not jsut the same old tourist thing I saw everywhere. They pointed me down an alley, out on a pier to a restaurant with its own dock on the water.  The place reminded me a good deal of the old New Orleans classic, Brunnings (R.I.P.). It has water on 3 sides and wood paneling on the walls. The waiters wear black bow ties and white jackets. The restaurant has its own dock, whichput the freshest seafood on my plate. I read reviews here on yelp while waiting at the bar about 20 minutes for a table. By the way, a 45 minute wait isn't really that bad. If I am going to get good food and good service I am willing to wait. Maybe that is just the NOLA in me though (see Galatoire's line for Friday lunch). I had their house Pale Ale, made by Red Hook. It was \u00a0good bitter beer, great as a compliment to the fish I was going to soon have.  I started with the clam chowder, as the reviews here on yelp indicated a should. It was very good (though I ahve no bassis for comparison, as it was the first time I had ever had clam chowder.) and it was full of large chunks of clam and potatoe, and lots of veggies.  After inquiring of the waitress (who was nice, but seemed like she had better things to do than wait on a table of 1; but don't blame the restaurant as a whole for her crimes) what was local and fresh. After she showed me what was, I decided on the red snapper in lemon butter sauce. The fish was delish, and it made quite a dish. The lemon butter sauce being practically the mueniere sauce I am used to at home, it reminded me more of dinner in New Orleans. The portions were GIGANTIC. The pasta that came with the fish was bland, but lets face it I wasn't there to eat the pasta anyway.  I appologize for all my comparison's to my home town, but as I see it, New Orleans is the unatainable standard of perfection as far as aseafood goes. If you are looking for good food on fisherman's wharf and want to avoid the tourist traps,I highly reccomend you stop here.",

We arrived on a Saturday evening with two other couples and no reservation; so we had to wait to be seated. The place was packed and I was not very hopeful of getting seated very quickly (even though the hostess did say 20minutes); so we made our way to the bar. We got some drinks; chatted it up; and before I was half-way done with my beer we were called to a table and seated.   We started the meal off with the crab cakes and fried calamari appetizers and they were good, but not great. I ordered the \"Lazy Man's\" Cioppino (LMC) and my wife got the Smoked Salmon Linguini. The LMC had a hefty price tag of $40 but it was worth every penny. The bowl came loaded with shrimp, fish, clams and scallops! It must've been a 80-20 ratio of seafood to sauce and I was afraid it was going to be the other way around. I did partake of my wife's Smoked Salmon Linguini and it, too, was terrific. The other two gentleman in our party got steaks- which I thought was going to be a mistake since I'd personally never order beef at a seafood joint, but if you want a steak you want a steak. They both said they were great and would order it again given the chance.   Our server, John, was great at making recommendations; answered all our questions and was very attentive (but not too attentive; you know what I'm saying).   The price tag was a little hefty, but well worth it. I can't wait to visit Pier 39 again so I can dine here again.",

Not much - if anything - \u00a0has been done to the decor in the past twenty years, but you come here for the food, not the ambiance. Think seafood with an Italian flair. For starters, share an order of calamari Calabrese-style, fried in a spicy tomato and red pepper sauce with mushrooms, and Dungeness crab cakes, prepared with a minimal amount of breading and served with a zesty remoulade. Pasta orders are huge and best shared, unless you intend one as your main course. Among my favorites is smoked salmon, rock shrimp, and red onion in a dill-cream sauce on a bed of fettucine. If they're in season, order the sand dabs, lightly grilled and served with lemon butter. The cioppino is sensational. Most entrees include fresh vegetables. Sauteed dishes are served with rice, while broiled or grilled dishes are served with pasta. Prices are very high, but portions are so overwhelmingly large that you'll be toting home enough for a second meal. As much as I'd like to award it a full five stars, their aggravating no-reservation policy means a very long wait to be seated, no matter the time of day, and the place is always so crowded, service can be brusque, out of necessity more than intention. Still, this is the best reason to come to the area, and the one place I always take out-of-town guests.

The clam chowder my mom ordered was really good borderline great. By far the best thing I had tonight. The other good dish was the cioppino. Tasty but I have had just as good elsewhere for less money.  This is where the good news ends for the food. I started with the lobster bisque myself and it was bland. Edible but for 10$ a cup I had higher expectations. The entree I ordered, which the waiter assured me was very good, was the prawns and scallop alla Gannon. I absolutely hated this dish. In fact I found it insulting. It came out looking like someone just threw it together. There is zero creativity in this dish and the only flavor is garlic. The vegetables looked and tasted like they were reheated frozen from a bag. The mashed potatoes, garlic of course, were like glue and there was a pile of rice under the whole mess. The \"stars\" of the dish should have been the scallops and the shrimp. While the scallops were cooked decently they had been overpowered with garlic and butter. The shrimp were overcooked and tough. For this I paid 38$?!?! \u00a0I expect this quality from a cheap chain restaurant and know for a fact I could cook better than this at home which is where I should have stayed. As for the place itself The location is fine but the decor is outdated and crowded the waiter was friendly enough but rather inattentive. I do not think I have had a more disappointing restaurant experience in my \u00a0whole life. My suggestion is try the chowder and hit the road or skip it altogether and spend your hard earned money on one of the other myriads of dining establishments that have not fallen asleep at the wheel.",

While the restaurant is a bit dated and the wait staff shows their age, this is still the place to go if you want fresh seafood...emphasis on fresh. The food is still the draw and well worth the visit. We'll be back again. Recommended.",

My co-worker and I had the butternut squash soup, crab cakes and cioppino. The butternut squash soup was mostly just pureed butternut squash. My coworker buried it in pepper and still didn't enjoy eating it. The crab cakes were good though pretty standard - no wow factor - and came with plain pasta and steamed veggies. Snooze! The cioppino was tasty - plenty of tasty broth and fresh seafood. I would have traded some of the white fish and thousands of tiny shrimp for just a few good pieces of scallop or something else.   The atmosphere was very old school, as well - old people, tourists, two Japanese business men, waiters from European countries. My co-worker and I (mid-20's) felt a bit out of place.   Overall - I'm sure this place is for someone with this many positive reviews, but it wasn't us.",

Mimosas were $8 and mojitos were $11 (typical restaurant price)  The clam chowder soup was delicious. It was in a small cup, but just enough. It had a lot of clams. I was really impressed &amp; satisfied.  I requested my steak to be Medium Rare - and it came out just as I wanted. It was although a bit dry at the ends, and tasteless. We asked for A1 sauce to save the day ! (:   Then there was the chocolate dessert. It was pretty yummy with an oreo crust.  The menu was really expensive - but it is off the pier.

    "review_text": "While I did enjoy the food and the (unintentionally kitschy) atmosphere, I must say that this place is overpriced and overrated.  First of all, the interior of this restaurant is truly comical. \u00a0It reminds me of somewhere my parents would take my sister and I in our small hometown for a \"fancy dinner\" in the early 80s (or late seventies had I been alive). \u00a0I think the walls are dark stained wood grain with bronze tinted mirrored sections and brass light fixtures. \u00a0Even more hilarious is the staff uniform of white tuxedo jackets and bow ties. \u00a0I wish I had been able to take a picture of all of this. \u00a0It was obvious that they were under the impression that they were providing a super classy dining atmosphere and experience, which could not be further from the truth.  What I found perhaps the most strange, aside from the fact that there was nary a meal under $30, was that they did not serve Coke or Pepsi. \u00a0When I asked for a Diet Coke, I was informed that they only had Diet RC Cola. \u00a0Um, isn't that a discount brand? \u00a0I had to look at the menu for almost half an hour to find something I would even consider eating, let alone spend $30+ on, and came up with Lobster Ravioli. \u00a0Gee, I've never had that before. \u00a0In their defense, it was pretty good and I had a bite of my friend's Lobster Bisque, which was lso good, but this is one of the few times that I've not been interested in trying anyone else's food. \u00a0I looked around the table and thought, nah.  Honestly, if you are a senior citizen with poor taste that likes cheesy traditional family restaurants but willing to pay top dollar the same experience you could have in a crappy diner somewhere, eat here. \u00a0Anyone else, get in a cab and get the hell out of this area. \u00a0I pretty much knew the experience would suck going into it, but I wanted to give it a chance since it was so highly regarded by the local who recommended it. \u00a0Fail.",

Very obvious seafood menu but also very good. The servers dress the part in their black and white and were helpful and with no attitude.

We went for lunch, hoping to save a few clams (groan, sorry. but I needed the $ for more Irish Coffees at Buena Vista). Anywho- yup, it was delicious. We had the crab appetizer, which was just enough for both of us to get really into seafood mode. Fresh and cold and plain, with dips on the side. Perfect. I had the Lazy Cioppino. Huge. And completely stuffed with stuff. Not bits of this and that swimming in broth, stuffed (you're waiting for me to say 'to the gills', but I can't do it to you twice in one review) . And not all white fish and a few bits of crab and some clams and mussels. This was worth every penny ingredient and quality-wise. And they will package up the leftovers very securely, since there is no way a normal human could finish it. Hubby had the seafood cannoli with scallops and crab. Super rich, he could only get through about half. If you want to eat again in the next 12 hours after Scoma's I suggest sharing a dish. I loved the restaurant and service. Definitely didn't have a touristy vibe, and was elegant yet casual. Sort of jeans and a tshirt are ok, but you remember to use the right fork and keep your elbows off the table. Since our friend said it was a 'splurge' meal, I really expected to pay a lot more. But I found the prices pretty much on par with the many other places we went. And so totally worth it.",

Not only was it the largest bowl of soup I've ever consumed, it was the most flavorful combination of brothy tomatoey perfection with a treasure trove of lovely shelled sea creatures to enjoy.   My only complaint... I ordered it \"lazy man's style\" with all shellfish cracked for me, but it left me wondering where the crab was? I could only find two small chunks in my soup. What the heck? I was really counting on some sweet salty crab bits in that bowl. It left me wondering if I had not been so lazy and had cracked it myself, would I have found more crab? When I told the waitress about this, she took it upon herself to bring my bowl back to the kitchen and added an insanely MASSIVE amount of crab meat to it. I was completely full by that point, but a local friend went home happy with crab soup dinner for the next night. Wrong, righted.   Wishing I could give this 4.5 stars...5 stars if the crab hadn't been MIA to begin with.",

The pork was served very dry and overcooked for my liking. The veggies were good; however, the polenta was fantastic.   Overall, this restaurant is overpriced and outdated inside. I imagine many of the dishes are very good, but you are really paying for prime real estate, not the food in front of you. Also, the view isn't that great, it has a parking lot view with a bit of wharf water and a warehouse across the waterway.   The valet was very rude to our party on several occasions. We were taking a group shot and he asked our uncle holding the camera to move so he could park a car. My uncle said he was almost done and would move, but it wasn't the immediate jump that the valet has expected. So he rolled his eyes and made several hand gestures showing his displeasure. It took another 10 seconds, and we moved our party inside to spend our couple thousand dollars on lunch.   I understand the valet is busy and has a job to do. However, there are ways to act, especially when we are your patrons who just tipped you, and are about to spend a bunch of money at your establishment.   We had a similar rude incident when leaving with this particular valet - I'm sorry I tipped him.   We also saw him park another patrons car too close to the edge of the dock, opened their car door into a wooden pier (somewhat hard), and then moved the car and walked away. Didn't check for damage, and I have a sneaking suspicion didn't tell the owners of the vehicle.   Needless to say, this valet left a poor taste in our mouths. Overall food was ok, prices much higher than the quality of the food was. Polenta was amazing though!  Also, sorry for getting long winded. My attempt to keep it short was obviously a fail.",

I had the MIXED SEAFOOD GRILL which will consist of 3 types of fish and 3 shrimps with grilled veggies and garlicky mashed potatoes for$39. \u00a0Tonight's selection included 3 small (just enough though) pieces of salmon, tuna and swordfish all very moist and tasty. \u00a0My friend had the LOBSTER RAVIOLI with Saffron Cream Sauce for $30 also very good. \u00a0The ravioli was tender and well seasoned and the filling had a nice texture to it. \u00a0The saffron cream sauce was very tasty. \u00a0The presentation was great with a very tender lobster claw on top. The server was attentive and kept our water glasses full. \u00a0From my review it seems like I should have given them five stars, each dish was very good but there just wasn't that memorable dish that deserves five stars.",

As a trendy foodie-type I rolled my eyes disdainfully of anything up in that darn touristy area, but ultimately acquiesced. When we walked in the door, it was packed to the gills (fish pun!) and I was wishing that I had been able to sway my mother earlier. It looked like it was straight out of the sixties and reminded me of restaurants we'd end up going to when visiting my grandparents.  I shall scoff no more at Scoma's. They're still in business for a reason. All the seafood was fresh and excellent, and I was able to pick good wines by the glass to go with. I don't remember what I chose w/ the cioppino other than it was red, but I recommend the Grgich Hills Fume Blanc w/ the mixed seafood plate. It's a sauv blanc that has spent some time in oak, so it's light, yet has some body.",

They have a great happy hour in the bar. All their bar menu items are made in smaller sizes, but it's only $5 each plate. I ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl and oysters, along with a Brancott Sauvignon Blanc ($9). The only open bar was facing the parking lot and pier, which was a bummer. They have another bar with a better bay view, but it wasn't open yet.   I arrived at 4:30 on a Wednesday, the bar was full. The service was quick and attentive. As soon as I sat down, the bartender took my order. The clam chowder bread bowl was excellent and quite substantial. The non happy hour price is $11, for $5 this is the best deal in town. The chowder was thick, full of clams, sourdough was fabulous and oh so tasty!   My oysters were great. For the happy hour, you get 3 nicely sized oysters.  I can't wait to come back for dinner!",

    "review_text": "The place gets a five star for location and a one star for density of patrons. They took a plan from the airlines play book and stuck as many micro tables as possible within their footprint. It is very cramped. I was practically leaning into the window waiting for the exit procedures to be announced.  Waited for the seat at the bar. Very cool. The bartender was one of the best. I had a cable car to get an \"authentic drink\". It was amazing even though I'm not a tequila fan. My friend on this business trip had a bloody mary which he said was perfect.   The host really was pushing us to get our seats, which was funny. Told him to tell the bartender and the two should work it out as we were waiting for him to make our drinks and then to close out the tab.  The waiter (as all of them appeared to be) probably had worked there 30 years. Very knowledgeable, confident and humorous. He gave us a rapid tour of one of the most ambiguous menus I've ever seen. Unlike Cheesecake Factories encyclopedias, this was a couple pages of bullet notes. I kid you not, my choice was \"Mixed Shellfish $40.\" I also ordered the Lobster Bisque.  At these prices, my quality meter went way up. I don't mind paying, but now I'm expecting. I love Captain D's cause for bucks you get $5.  The Lobster Bisque was fantastic, but I think a lobster may have bathed in the pot two years ago. I don't remember anything solid bumping into my teeth. The mixed shellfish was a huge plate. Half of it crisp vegetables (quite a \"mix\") and a third was rice and pasta. The pasta was incredible and the sauce was very good. The mixed seafood consisted of \u00a03 scallops, 3 shrimp, and two chunks of micro lobster tail that made me think they were fishing in the crustaceans' preschool.  The fantastic waiter practically disappeared after serving us long after our order. If I had my wife on a romantic evening, the alone time would have been welcome. On an airline with a business friend, it only reinforced how uncomfortable this was. The bill eventually came back. I thought the food was very good (not exceptional), but totally not at the same level as the bill.  Would I go again? If someone else was buying and if I wasn't choosing. San Fran has thousands of other untried restaurants that I would rather check out. I can understand ANY rating between 1 and 5 depending on how crowded/busy and what's ordered.",

Yes, there are several great restaurants in this town, but Scoma's is really \"something else\". First, it is not a tourist trap, as I see and hear most of the guests are locals. Then, the overall feeling - elegance yet unpretentious, quality yet not snobbish, efficient yet not pushy.  Tonight, I was \"party of one\" - probably least interesting type of guest. Perhaps I was lucky, but I got excellent table, and no waiting.... I'm pretty sure that they don't recognize me from before, so this is luck and/or standard practice. As for the food, I ate all. The portions are not \"amerikanski\" XXL, nor French \"taste a spoonful\" - this is genuine Italian - you get decent size meal. This evening it was Mr Sonny, but service was very decent any time before as well. So, price/performance this place is a true Gem. Yes, there is better food to get in restaurants that are significantly more expensive, but hey I've had more expensive \"stuff\" that is far behind what Scoma's delivers. Consistency, quality, style.

Scoma's is an upscale and classy seafood spot in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf with a staff well versed in everything seafood and wine and an impressively extensive menu. The servers can sometimes feel a bit lethargic and come across as a tad pretentious but given the upscale ambiance and old-SF vibe, it fits right in.   My friend and I headed here to celebrate the crab season and thus ordered the Crab Risotto and Garlic Roasted Dungeness Crab. We also prefaced the meal with some calamari as an appetizer. All three items were fabulously solid in their own exclusive way - the risotto was creamy in a tomato-based broth with large chunks of fresh crab meat spread evenly throughout. The dungeness crab was fresh, tender and came with some butter for dipping pleasure. And the calamari was crispy and fried to perfection. We paired all of the above with a some Prosecco and it matched perfectly.   The food gets 4.5 stars, service gets 3.5 - 4 stars and ambiance gets 4 stars - hence the 4 star average.   If you're in the Fisherman's Wharf area and are in the mood for an upscale seafood dining experience, definitely consider Scoma's.",

My friend suggested lunch at Scoma's, a place he and his family have been going to since he was a boy. The seafood here is apparently so fresh and cooked so well, anything on the menu will come out tasting delicious. There were so many things to choose from, I didn't know where to begin. \u00a0It probably took 10 minutes until I finally decided to go with the prix-fixe lunch menu for $23.95. \u00a0I opted for the cup of clam chowder soup, the dry pack sea scallops with garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies, and the chef selection dessert. My friend had the same, but ordered the pasta garibaldi for his entree instead.   Best... clam chowder.. EVERRRR! I salivated and savored each scoop of soup. The clam meats were endless. The taste to die for. So rich in clam juice goodness that I was genuinely saddened when I got to the bottom of my soup cup. \u00a0I simply don't think I can look at any other clam chowder soup the same after having this one. In fact, as I am writing this review, my taste buds are salivating for some more.   The scallops were super tender, not in the least bit undercooked or overcooked. Sadly there were only 4 medium sized scallops for me to savor (my friend ate my 5th one to try). The garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies were delicious, nothing out of the ordinary.  Picked off my friend's pasta garibaldi for a bit while he was trying my plate, and I loved his plate too! The pasta sauce is creamy, rich, and has a hint of wine hidden within the tomato goodness. The mixed seafood in the pasta was amazing too--tender, juicy chunks of salmon and tasty mussels. \u00a0I couldn't spot any scallops but I'm sure it was delicious too. Yum, yum, yum.   Finally, for dessert, they served us a chocolate marquise with raspberry coulis. This was absolutely too chocolate-y rich for my taste so I only manage to finish half of it.   Overall, the food is a little pricey and the portions are healthy sized (which, I understand many consider this to be small) and the service is excellent. To top it off, you get a gorgeous view of the wharf and boats. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for to-die-for seafood. Bon appetit.",

I ordered the Lazy Man's Cioppino (yes, sometimes, it's just that kind of night) and I mostly thought it tasted like ketchup and definitely not flavorful enough for the price it was commanding. Maybe it was my fault but down the street, I have definitely gotten a better cioppino from a place name just that...  I'm tempted to try Scoma's again because I feel like it can redeem itself food-wise. I just have to order the right things is what I'm thinking. So Yelpers, look for the best dish that everyone loves and gets that but stay away from the cioppino!",

    "review_text": "Been here a couple times and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of their seafood. Yes, it is a bit pricey as some of the other reviews noted, but if you want a sit down restaurant in SF, this is not an outrageous price. DO NOT compare it to In &amp; Out across the street...I suspect the person who did don't even know what seafood is...=p  I have had oysters, clam chowder, halibut, bay shrimp cocktail, bay shrimp and crab louie, and other various things from here. I've always liked what I've had -- the food is fresh and prepared well. A friend who's visiting has been hunting down for crab places in SF and found the roasted whole dungeness crab \"very very delicious although a bit pricey\". My picky boyfriend (picky about clam chowder =p) who's been to chowderfest in Boston a few times raved about how fresh the clams in the clam chowder is.  With the location of the restaurant (with the decent view), you would expect the portions to be more \"European\" even though they do charge quite a bit for the food. In fact, that is what I would have liked (with a slightly cheaper price) because I stuff myself every time I'm here. For example, the bay shrimp and crab louie is served with a mountain of shrimp and crab such that the beets and avocado seem to be almost falling off the plate. I had to bring half of it home in order to be able to fit in dessert.  Their desserts are also a delight, so maybe sure not to miss them if you have any appetite left (or save up some appetite for it!). Their wine list is decent with some local selections that we like, and I've also enjoyed their dessert wines very much.  Service is not spectacular but I can live with it. If the service were any better, this would have been a 5-star restaurant.",

Fast fwd to the next day and we went down said side street to take a look. Wow, what a great setting, all these little boats moored up and this great looking restaurant overlooking the bay and harbor. Walking up I see the white table cloths so you know its gonna be fancy and then looking at the menu outside the prices confirmed it but you get what you pay for and I wanted more than bar food. Quite posh inside, we get seated at nice window table and our waiter, Jose A and his helper were quick with menus, bread &amp; water. He was very helpful as I couldn't decide which fish to go for tho ended up on the Alaskan Halibut. He was also great help with some of the beers that I was not familiar with and I tried Anchor Steam and Liberty Ale.  The fish was awesome, cooked to perfection and I wiped the plate clean with the extra bread. Best dining experience in a long time and the bill wasn't that bad!",

The down fall was that we were told we would have to wait 45 mins for a table which was no biggie until we ended up waiting an hour and 45 minutes. When I went to ask how much longer it would be the hosted lied to our faces as if we were already called , this wasn't possible because we were standing inside the whole time within ten feet from where she was standing and would have heard her, when I told her this she got really offended at us and told us in a very loud tone not to argue with her, which we werent doing. and which was sort of embarssing because there were so many people around us  Besides that I would recommend this place because the food was amazing. I couldnt eat much see food because I am pregnant but I did try the crap cakes and they were delicious. I just got pasta which was probably some of the best pasta I had ate. my boyfriend got a plate that was all sea food and he loved it! Just go on a week day when it's not so crazy.  Also, they say no reservations but we seen her tell a few different people she would  \"take care of them\" and somehow these people would be called infront of other people who had been wating.",

Some reviewers note that the prices are on the high side, even if worth it. \u00a0Scoma's does have a three course price fixe for $45, a great option for those on a budget.   Ok-now about the food. Amazing lobster bisque, and this is coming from a New Englander. The price fixe version comes with a deconstructed lobster salad on the side. I added the lobster meat from that into the bisque and was in heaven. The main course was a scallop and pasta dish in a light cream sauce. Everything about it was perfect. Dessert was a brownie and ice cream duo. The brownie was mediocre at best. BUT, the homemade caramel sauce that accompanied the ice cream was pure heaven, so I didn't mind not eating the brownie at all.   I would definitely recommend.   We went on a Sunday night, without reservations. They were very busy, but the wait was less than half an hour. It is down a small side street, so you have to have an idea of where you are going.",

Scomas is made for these sweet people. It's not the place for a jaded palate. Their nod to keeping up with the times is the beer selection, so points for that.

This is one of my favorite restaurants ever - let alone just the Wharf. If you are headed to the wharf in search of seafood and happen to pass up Scoma's... shame on you. You have committed a food sin, and your palette will be punished. Don't even stop at Guardino's for a crab cake before hand. Tempting as it is, you are going to need to save every inch of space inside your stomach for what's in store.  Well what is in store you ask?  How about waterside dining? Not that the interior of the restaurant in all it's beauty should be ignored, but when you have giant windows to look outside at the swaying fishing boats...it's hard to look else where. It is also placed a bit away from the main street, so the big eyed tourist and crazies won't bother you. That said, this place does have a lot of tourist in it, but who cares. The locals come here too. When the food is this good, everyone hears about it.  The service at Scoma's is just as excellent as its location. The waiters/waitresses are both extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I've had many different servers during my visits and every time I felt the same wisdom and charm from each of them. They know the food is good, they love to work there, and even more importantly, they love to share the experience with you.  The menu is pretty daunting, but you can't go wrong here. That is unless you are one of \"those types\" and order a hamburger or something. If that's the case, head next door to the N and Out. But if you have some sense in you and want some of the best seafood in the city, here are some of my favorite items to help you out:  Depending on your party size, you're going to want to start out with either a cup of the Lobster Bisque or the Hot Appetizer Sampler Plate.   After that, the MUST HAVE item that someone in your party has to get (but warn them that once others try it that they might not be getting much), is the Shellfish Sautee. Remember these words - Shellfish Sautee. Write it on your hand if need be - but for the love of god, remember to order this. The Shellfish Sautee.  Another top notch thing to get is the Cioppino. Serving about 2-3 people, the Cioppiano is pretty massive, but so is its deliciousness.  Other than these must haves, the other seafood options are bound to be fantastic as well.   Enjoy!",

They suggested this place - so we figured if the locals thought it was good - it's probably pretty solid.   It's definitely really old-school - both in terms of the atmosphere and the food. The service was great, they helped us navigate a somewhat vague food menu. The food was also really good. My scallops were outstanding, but my prawns were a bit dry. Everyone else at my table really enjoyed their meals as well. One person we were with - who is originally from SF - swears by the Cioppino and made all of us try it. It's HUGE, and despite four people trying bites, and her giving it her all, she still took a boatload home.   It's pretty pricey, but it feels like one of those classic, old-school seafood restaurants that you have to try. Why change if it's still good, right?",

Who likes looking for parking at the wharf? Geez... that's the reason why I never go! Not at Scomas! Scomas does comp parking! Just gotta tip the guy... but shoot... still a deal if you ask me!  They have a prefix deal as well... and it's very well rounded. They have a big variety and choices to pick from. However, all 4 members of our party got the lobster bisque and lobster salad for appetizer... and that's all we still talk about!  It was theeeeeeeeeeeeeee best lobster bisque I've had. And I had lobster bisque in Boston.. where the lobster is fresh! And no. this still wins hands down. Hands and feet down. Throughout the night.. all 4 of us couldn't wait to burp so we could taste that creamy slightly mild lobster bisque again!   The entree was suuuuuper delicious... and dessert was great as well!  I truly have found a new seafood stop for me in SF. And I am super picky being in the culinary field of my options.   Come to Scoma's and get the Lobster Bisque and you will die and go to heaven and not want to return. PROMISE.",

The waiter took forever to come and acknowledge that we sat down. He brought water with him but took forever to bring out the beverages we asked for. He even forgot to bring an alcoholic beverage that we ordered.  We finally knew what we wanted to order so we placed it. 2 whole crabs, halibut, calamari, lazy man ciopinno, clam chowder and a ceasar salad.  When my brother said he wanted the whole crab and then ordered the halibut the waiter said so you don't want the whole crab?? And we all looked at him crazy!  My brother said he wanted both and the waiter said oh that a lot of food and told us the market price for the crab, making us feel like we couldn't afford it or something.... This guy was pissing us off! Maybe because he serviced the Caucasian people a lot faster then he did us brown folk!  Everything took forever to come out!!! Our drinks were empty and our waiter was nowhere to be found!  The food was honestly mediocre... The ciopinno is nothing fancy at all. For our bill being $230 for only 3 of us wouldn't have been bad if the waiter didn't take so long! We still left him a decent tip even though he made us feel like we weren't worthy to dine here.  I usually go to Pompei's Grotto which is a lot better and the service is amazing!! The food is also better in flavor than Scoma's.",

You can drive right up to the restaurant and valet your car which sure beats parking in the public lot. We were craving fresh caught crab, but apparently the crabbers are negotiating prices with the buyers.The crab and consumer is caught in the middle, well maybe lucky for the crab because they get to live a little while longer until the two sides agree on a price. We had to settle for flash frozen crab from Alaskan waters. The crab was saut\u00e9ed in a scrumptious garlic-olive oil sauce that just begged to be sopped up with the chewy, tangy sourdough bread that they give out. Waiters are efficient and honest. I like that they don't try to oversell the most expensive item on the menu.",

It's been here for over fifty years, and as an older friend of mine who grew up here says, it hasn't changed the entire time. It's on Fisherman's Wharf, but it's not ON the Wharf... you have to know where it is in order to find it. It's to the side and behind the other storefronts. It has an excellent bar, and carries some local microbrews.  Last time I was here, I went with a few friends. We sat at the bar chugging local brews while waiting for our seats--about 20 minutes total. Then our names were called and we were seated at a nice table by the window. Scoma's isn't a boat, but it feels like you're on a boat. You can look out and see the water and I'm pretty sure I can feel the restaurant rocking with the waves.  I got the Cioppino a la Pescatore (Lazy Man's). It very good. I have had better though. Scoma's Cioppino comes in a thin broth, and the amount of finfish is almost overwhelming compared with the scant amount of Clams, Scallops and Prawns. And the fish chunks are very large--you'll probably end up awkwardly cutting it with your spoon like I did. It's still very good though. We had some white wine, and I can't recall what it was--probably Sauv Blanc or Pinot Grigio. Either way, it was paired very nicely. Overall, the server was very good and took care of us without being overly attentive.  Tiramisu? You bet. And it's darn good, too. It even comes with a little tiny chocolate spoon. (I'm not sure what for... you can't eat with it, but it's a nice touch). Overall, an excellent experience.",

It's off the beaten path, barely visible from the street.  Based on my last visit: The service starts as soon as you drive in. I don't think I have the greatest car, but the valet guy seemed to like my Subie STi way more than the Porche Carrera which was parked right in front. He went about parking my car. When I later came outside to get something out of the car, I noticed the Porche was moved up further and my car was closest to the door. Big ups to the valey guy!!  As you come in, you're greeted by the Maitre d'. The wait usually isn't longer than 15 minutes. Scoma's is a fairly large restaurant. The bar is to the left of the Maitre d' podium, so I usually grab a quick drink before being seated. Last time, my father and I didnt even have a chance to take a sip and they were already calling our name for the table.   We were seated in one of the back dining rooms with great views of the pier. You can watch local fisherman dock up and unload their daily catch. You could not ask for a better backdrop when you're about to enjoy some seafood!  I usually always order the Swordfish at Scoma's. You can order it blackened or Cajun stylye. The cajun style is the best in my opinion. The seasoning goes great with the fish. Each plate comes with a generous serving of veggies and your choice of a potato or rice pilaf. My dad swears by the Cioppino. It has a whole array of seafood all mixed up in a tomato based soup. \u00a0Did I mention they serve endless supplies of SF Sourdough bread as an appetizer??   Scoma's is a great place for a good lunch or a nice date. I try to always make a stop when I'm in the city and don't have any eating plans.",

It was a cool way of trying out different types of oysters to see which ones we like best so that we can order more of that kind.   I had the the wild caught king Salmon and it was divine. The outside has been seared nicely and the inside was pink. Served with some mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies, its a winner's dish. I can really taste the freshness of the salmon.   My partner in crime had the pasta with the little clams and holy jebus there was a lot of clams. We counted at least two and a half dozens of clams in that pasta.. which wasn't a bad thing. The juice of the clams imparted a lot of flavor that the pasta soaked up which was just great.",

I also tried the Grilled Tuna Steak sandwich. It was moist, and tasted super fresh. My companions had the Cioppino. It was the best I have ever tried. The broth was sweet from the tomatoes, but the natural seafood flavor added just the right amount of flavor without once making me think it was salty. Everything was cooked perfectly. The scallops had that snap and texture that is the mark of true freshness. Wow.  Our server Sean was great, very friendly and welcoming. In fact, the entire waitstaff here is all over the place (in a very good way), always attentive to the customers.  My only regret is that I got full.

I started to see a trend that if you walk into any restaurant that has been opened for any length of time on the bay, it will be known as a \"tourist trap.\" This is another one of those places. Tourist trap or not, it wouldn't still be open if the food wasn't good. I didn't identify where everyone was from in the place, so from a qualified standpoint I can say it was busy without the known tourist status of the visitors.  The place appears small, but deceitfully seats more people than you'd expect.  We sat at the bar and had their Seahorse cocktail, in other circles this would be known as a Moscow Mule in glassware. The drinks were refreshing and our bartender was extremely helpful during our visit.  From the menu, my fianc\u00e9e ordered a cup of the clam chowder and the dungeoness crab cocktail. She said both were excellent. I had the dungeoness crab risotto. It is served in a generous portion and is a tasteful mixture of vegetables, crab, and risotto. \u00a0For those with gluten intolerance, the menu has an asterisk next to the options that are safe for you.

    "review_text": "Hidden at the deep end of a pier, Scoma's is a shrine to the sea.  Behind the tourist curtain of Fisherman's wharf, the easy to miss alley leading to this secret is an enchanting trip down history.   Fishing boats sway on either side, as the Gates leading to the bay provide a spectacular backdrop.  Similar to Tadich, Scoma's has a staff that is as much a part of the institution as the food. Old humor, quick sarcasm, and a hefty laugh; these guys will put you in your place, leave you with a smile, and age better than wine.  The night started out with a dozen oysters and steamed mussels. Horse radish with ammo will clear your nostrils, but the oysters would have it no other way.  The family was on a Dungeness crab kick, while I ventured with the famous Scoma's Shellfish Saute.  This dish is a monster.  It's as if the Chef seasoned the sea, took a scoop of it and delivered it to you.  Prawns, scallops, chunks of crab and 2 lobster tails adorn the plate. All resting on a bed of rice and pasta that will leave your stomach feeling like it just left the gym. You want seafood. The answer's right here.  Scoma's is a gem, and another great find within the soul of our great city. Just when you think you know SF, it'll teach you a lesson to never stop looking.",

Granted, I've been twice and didn't pay either time but it was still really good, some of the best cooked seafood I've ever had. Service is a bit slow but this is the kind of place you want to have a long meal at anyway. This was apparently my grandmother's favorite restaurant back in the day and I can see why.  The Oysters Rockefeller are amazingggg. I normally don't love this dish as much as I do here. So, so tasty. Crab stuffed mushroom is also a favorite.  The first time I came here I had the Alaskan Halibut Siciliana, which was perfectly cooked and so flavorful.   The second time had the Mixed Shellfish Sautee and Oh my goodness was that amazing. It comes with prawns, scallops, crab meat and lobster - ridiculous amounts and again cooked perfectly. Well worth the price. This dish was huge and delicious.   I've also tried (through people that I was eating with) the Lobster Ravioli, Prawns and Scallops Alla Gannon and the steamed clams platter. Not to be repetitive but all were amazing as well.   Pro tip: go later if you can, at ~9:30 pm. They don't take reservations and for obvious reasons this place is crazy popular but by this time it seems like there's not really a wait. Tried it out on a Thursday and a Saturday.",

I ordered the Prix Fixe Menus: starter of a small cup of clam chowder and a small side of caesar salad=5 entree of Blackened Prawns over Pasta Vodka; Brown Rice Penne Pasta, Pancetta, Tito's Vodka Sauce=5 desert of vanilla ice cream and warm brownie=5  My wife ordered 1/2 a crab, guess what?

A plate piled high of dungeness crab meat. Seriously, PILED HIGH. It's accompanied by some lettuce, thickly sliced and crunchy carrots, slices of tomatoes, wedges of lemon, and a thousand island dressing on the side. It's so good you won't even need the dressing.  We've been here so many times and have had a number of different items on the menu and nothing ever disappoints.

Definite charm to this San Francisco institution. The french bread was amazing, of course. Our server recommended the crab louie that had crab fresh off their boat. I got the shrimp/crab Louie lunch that came with a cup of clam chowder. Great chowder. A large amount of food in the Louie, but more that a couple bites had me fishing crab shell out of my mouth.

    "review_text": "I think I would rate this place FANTASTIC/EXCELLENT if it was not for the snotty service we received.  Scoma's came HIGHLY recommended by family, friends, and fellow travelers on our recent trip to Fisherman's Wharf. We were prepared to enjoy a fabulous meal. We didn't make a reservation but put our name on the waiting list and took a walk around Ghiradelli Square. We arrive back in about 45mins and were promptly seated. So far so good right?  No... Our waitress quickly profiled the three 20-something professional women sitting at the table as not her priority. We asked for specials and got a short hand version of \"scallops with rice\" without any further explanation or offering (this was also not the special). When we asked for her recommendation on wine, she picked the cheapest bottle on the menu after stating she can't recommend a bottle because she \"does not know us\" and her choice was unrelated to our meal choices (we chose a different bottle). She only came back to our table to bring us food and collect the check. Not the type of service I EXPECT when I'm paying $30 a plate and buying a bottle of wine for the table.  But, on to better things! I hope others can report a better time with service and this review does not deter you from trying to AMAZING food Scoma's has to offer. First off, the Salmon was fabulous in a butter dill sauce paired with garlic mashed potatoes. The calamari was fried to perfection and melted in my mouth. And the crab cakes are a must! Hands down the best crab cake I have EVER tasted. The crab stuffed portabella mushroom is a worthy appetizer but a small portion if you want more than 2 bites.  Overall a great tasting meal, and I would return for the food alone. I'll over look the service this time, but don't burn me twice, and if the Scoma's Manager/Owner is reading this... I recommend a chat with your staff on profiling. We may have looked young but we still walked out of your restaurant with a $150 bill :)",

    "review_text": "I was loving the lady out front at Scoma's last Saturday night. With her coke-bottle glasses and frizzy hair, she looked like she'd been sitting in that seat for about 50 years, since Al Scoma first started running the joint. (I saw a picture of Al on the wall and was pleasantly surprised to observe that he could be Jerry Stiller's twin brother.) This lady seemed precariously perched on the border of professional and curt, experienced and jaded, more of a cariacature than a real human being. She kept me entertained while we waited to be seated. See, Scoma's doesn't accept reservations, so we waited about an hour to be seated, which was, I think, not unconscionable for a group of six on a Saturday night.  Our waiter was great: helpful, but unintrusive. We hardly noticed him, and that's a sign of a truly great waiter, in my opinion. We started with the sampler plate, which included possibly the best calamari I have ever had, yummy crab cakes, and scrimp scampi.  For my entree, I ordered the cioppino, which I would recommend to anyone! The tomato broth had a fantastic flavor, and the broth was filled with fish, clams, crab, prawns, shrimp... all fresh and perfectly cooked. A slice of garlic bread on the side topped it off. Yeah, it was $35, but I ate it while watching the sun set ever so slowly over the water and the unimaginably large boats roll in and out of the Bay. It's not just a meal; it's an experience.  Everyone else seemed to love their food as well. I would absolutely return here for more excellent Italian-style seafood on the Wharf.",

It's San Francisco, you can get good seafood just about anywhere. But, we wanted outstanding. \u00a0  Heros was server. At first, I thought he was pretty much a jerk - wouldn't let us finish our order and kept walking away. But, by the end he was pretty funny and telling us silly jokes. \u00a0He has been there forever.  The place was dying down pretty early.

We started with the hot sampler appetizer which was: rock shrimp scampi, calamari, and crab cakes. \u00a0To be honest, justin G picked this and i was only looking forward to the crab cakes as i don't usually care for shrimp or calamari due to their textures. \u00a0Well i was eating my words when they brought it out because the rock shrimp were so tiny and delicious, and although it was a scampi, it was a think i bit tomato based which was so tasty. \u00a0The calamari was awesome...fried but not greasy, not rubbery, just very light. \u00a0And the crab cakes were good too. \u00a0Served with three different sauces on the side - all of them were delicious. \u00a0Then we got the chioppino to share. \u00a0$39 dollars for an enormous steaming hot bowl of chioppino. \u00a0For everyone that doesn't know, it's a fish stew with a tomoto and white wine base. \u00a0Our waiter asked us how spicy we like things so we went with level two of five and it was perfect for me. \u00a0Huge chunks of swordfish, musscles, clams, huge chunks of crab meat, enormous shrimp, and plenty of other types of seafood i can't even recall. \u00a0The flavors were freaking delicious...all of the seafood was so so good. \u00a0While i don't normally love all seafood because of texture, i loved everything that was in my bowl. \u00a0Maybe i'm just not used to seafood this fresh? Either way, this meal was awesome. \u00a0I felt like i was in such a happy food daze for the entire night just thinking about this meal. \u00a0While Scoma's is not the trendiest place out there, i sure thinks its worth a try while in fisherman's wharf. \u00a0I would certainly love to return if i'm ever back in SF.",

The vibe in there is nice as well, it was a busy Sunday evening when I went and they have very limited reservations, so I had to wait about an hour to get seated.   As for the dinner, I started off with a very tasty bloody mary and the BLACK-N-BLUE AHI, which was perfectly seared. My main course was the SHRIMP AND SCALLOPS ALLA GANNON which came with a side of veggies, mashed potatoes, and rice. The shrimp and scallops were really great; you can tell the seafood was fresh.   Overall, I would recommend this place to dine in at least once. The menu has many options, if I end up there again I'll be going for the Lobster ravioli.",

We came on a Sunday at around 4:30pm and the wait was already about 45 minutes. It was highly recommended by a friend so we decided to just stick it out. The place itself is kind of dim and has a sort of old-school-class feel to it. We took a look at the menu beforehand and I was blown away by the prices. We were seated in a section that I think had just opened up for dinner because we were the first ones there but it filled up quickly. Our server was beyond friendly and knowledgeable, answered all our questions and patiently waited as we debated what to ordered.  We got an appetizer, Oyster Rockefeller Alla Scoma (cheese, lemon, and spinach on oysters), which were SO GOOD, so flavorful and really just blew me away even more than the menu prices. My main dish was the Pasta Alla Scoma (garlic butter sauce linguini with clams) and it was filled with lots of clams (which it better be for the price). It was pretty good.  Again the appetizer and server are what have me really liking this place. I want to really love Scoma's but I'm just not sure the price lives up to it. If you do stop by though, definitely try the Oyster Rockefeller Alla Scoma (if you're into that)!",

    "review_text": "So, my manfriend had been waxing poetic about a place he dined while at a conference in San Francisco ages ago. The way he described it, it sounded like an unknown diamond in the rough. Separately, I had bookmarked Scoma's as a place we might want to go for a nice dinner. Lo and behold, they were one in the same.  We hadn't planned to hit Scoma's in advance, so the best we could do with Open Table was an 8:45 reservation. After a day of walking around and an impromptu bar crawl, we decided to try our luck for an earlier table. We grabbed a drink at the bar after \u00a0putting our name in; definitely a happening place with a friendly crowd. For him, The Dinghy and for me, The Calm Before the Storm, a tasty, spicy take on a margarita.  Scoma's is tucked away from the madness of Jefferson and the Embarcadero, but the secret is out, so make reservations. The ambiance reminded me of a steak house; waiters in white coats, attentive service, large portions and the absence of any gimmicky seafood decor (nets, plastic crabs and lobsters, etc.).  To start we had Black and Blue Ahi, a crusted and seared ahi served with greens, which was just as tasty as it looked. We struggled choosing entrees, everything sounded delicious. I will say though, if you abstain from pork, let your server know. There were a couple of dishes that didn't list panchetta in the menu description that I scrapped from my list. He ended up going with the swordfish piccata, which was perfectly cooked and flaorful. I went wit the scallop risotto, so wonderfully decadent. The scallops were cooked beautifully.  With limited time in the city, I keep a short list of places I make a point of returning to. Scoma's has easily made that list. The steakhouse ambiance makes it an easy choice for a nice date, business meeting or fancier meal.",

They wanted to go to Scoma's. So we went. Restaurant does not take reservations. We waited for about 45 minutes. During that time, we hung out at the bar. Bartenders were really helpful and friendly. Got a chardonnay to start and bartender poured a lot into my glass. WOW. Thanks!  Menu covered everything you can imagine in an Italian Seafood restaurant. It took me a while to read through the whole thing. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted. They also had a prix-fixe menu which 100% proceeds go to the oil disaster relief. I didn't find out about this until AFTER I ordered. Thank you waiter for telling us. I was not happy. We ordered the Pasta Diplomatica that comes with lobster tails, prawns, clams, and sea scallops on linguine; can be served in cream sauce or marinara sauce. We also ordered the popular Cioppino Alla Pescatore that included prawns, clams, shrimp, sea scallops, fresh fish, and Dungeness crab in a tomato broth. It comes with a bib. Nice. Another dish that was ordered was the broiled king salmon on crab ravioli. Ravioli was superb! All the dishes were wonderfully prepared. Although, the cioppino looked slightly water-down. Ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Portions are huge. I had leftovers for lunch today.  Scoma's surprised me. I really enjoyed my meal. The service was extraordinary. They have complimentary valet parking. This is a big plus in the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's Wharf. Prices are on the steeper side but expected for a seafood restaurant in a tourist area.

My husband started with clam chowder. He said that it was delicious. Then came the fried calamari. So good. I ate most of it! Then his cioppino, which he said was the best thing he's ever eaten. Which is saying something, 'cause he's very picky and rarely raves about anything. Along with the cioppino came my main course...

We were seated 5 minutes ahead of schedule.  We ordered the cold seafood appetizer for two with clams, oysters, crab claws , and shrimp. It was okay but not outstanding for $29. \u00a0We ordered the Shellfish Saut\u00e9 ($40) and Scoma's Pasta. I have never seen so many clams in one dish--I counted 32! \u00a0The pasta was average other than the vast amount if clams, it needed more garlic to my taste .  The Shellfish Saut\u00e9 included shrimp, two small lobster tails, juicy sweet scallops and other seafood goodies. It was worth the price but a huge amount of food.   Scoma's is a great place for tasty seafood but a bit on the pricy side. Our total was $137 for dinner for two with one glass of wine.",

Tonight, I ordered a bowl of clam chowder, pasta diplomatica, pasta bolognese, dungeness crab spoon bread, and the salmon on lobster ravioli with saffron sauce. Of course I loved the clam chowder and pasta diplomatica, but the rest were only okay. The pasta bolognese was good, but not to die for. I was really excited to try the dungeness crab spoon bread, but it wasn't good. The bread was very, very soft and the crab tasted like microwaved food. I wasn't a huge fan of the salmon on lobster ravioli with saffron sauce, but maybe that's because I had such a strong taste in my mouth after the crab spoon bread so I wasn't tasting properly.   Great, friendly, fast service.",

It carries a big name, which attracts a lot of people to it, but for price, it is not worth it.  I had scallops. They were fresh and tasty. The meal was filling, but the scallops were imported from the east coast, which kind of made me wonder, what's the point of eating west coast sea food?   We got bread with oil and the wait staff was as attentive as they needed to be. Nothing over the top and they only stuck around to get drink orders and returned regularly, but were never engaging or conversational. Just sort of there to bring us food and that was it. Almost robot like really.  Family member had some dungeness crab with her salad and that was good, but outrageously priced.",

I initially was concerned since the place is in such a touristy area and that usually signals sub-par food to me...but after seeing the reviews on here and getting a recommendation from a friend thought we would try it out. Upsetting.  We started with a bottle of wine and the calamari. It was so-so....I was really expecting the best calamari I've ever had...but then again when the fish is fried, I guess it doesn't really matter how fresh it is anyways.   For my entree, I asked the waiter what his favorite risotto was...he said the Prawn Risotto, so I went with it. So disappointing. It was so FISHY! The entire dish was, not even just the prawns. I will give them credit that the risotto was cooked properly, but still...just a disappointment.  Boyfriend had some fish dish...I did try it, but don't recall what it was, so it must have not been that memorable...or perhaps it was just the second bottle of wine that is making my mind so fuzzy...but even if so, you'd think I'd enjoy the food then, right? ;]  Anyways...had it not been for the wine and the really outstanding service, Tim was his name, I would probably give Scoma's only one star.

In fact, we hold the Scoma's calamari (get it with the red sauce for something spicy &amp; different) as a benchmark for all others.  Waiters are great, and the cocktails well made. The prices are high, but you get so much high quality food, and everyone leaves with a take home box, that you actually have two meals.

I came in a large group, so I was able to try a lot of things off the menu. Every thing was amazing. Pretty much, with every bite, you are having the best seafood experience of your life. If you are a fan of dungeness crab, but you do not like fighting them for every spec of meat, you must get the King Louis salad. It is basically a couple of leaves of lettuce, covered with a mountain of fresh crab meat that someone else fought to get out on your behalf. A serious mountain. The crabcakes are to die for; or at least flying back (5 hours each way) for. The lobster ravioli, amazing. Everything, amazing.  Bottom line, what ever you choose off the menu, you will not be disappointed. Our group was certainly not.",

The Crab Cakes were good, not great. They just didn't meet my expectations. The Clam Chowder was good as well, just not the best.  Expensive but tasted very good overall.

And plus with a view that you get, it's pretty unique to anywhere else in SF.  My friend is in love with this place. One. due to her favorite waiter Chris (which we will get into later) and two, this apparently is the best lazy man's cioppino she's ever had. And both were definitely true.   Chris is a waiter of another caliber. If you go here, you should ask her for him--because in the quaint quarters, you will see that a lot of the others paled in comparison. He's warm, inviting, and just equipped with the skills that make his customer service unique to anyone else. He brought us all the delicious bread we wanted, and this spicy tomato sauce to dip it in. He also didn't look at us crazy when we wanted to dip in their lobster bisque, too. ZOMG, my favorite.  I indulged in all of it until for a split second I realized I was trying to still be somewhat skinny for Hawaii.  The friends I were with got the cioppino and OH MY, it is worth the $37. The sauce is not overbearing, but consistent enough to carry all the seafood in it. I abstained from it, because I didn't want to do some clams and stuff (I'm weird). I paid for it though when I got the lobster ravioli with the king salmon. Each item was good on it's own, but together it didn't marry well to me. The salmon was delicious, the lobster ravioli was yummy, but the sauce didn't marry them well. It felt like I was eating two separate dishes.  But the fat girl, I am, I still satisfied myself in some sort of small way by eating it all.  Tiramisu was delicious, rich and slightly heavy--but still made me want to lick the cup. Chris was gracious enough to bring it even when I declined it, because he knew my birthday was coming up.  Overall, a wonderful experience. Now that winter is coming up, cioppino timed right with a paycheck--will make for an excellent winter evening.",

Once seated I looked out one window towards the Wharf, then the other at the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a sunny day. The view, alone was priceless. Then we got our bowl of chowder. Man, that was some good chowder. Next up the calamari. I think it melted in my mouth like butter. How do they make calamari that's not rubbery? And the dipping sauces. Holy Marinara! I ordered the salmon and I think I died, went to heaven, talked to God and the Fishermen Angels and we all agreed that while the food was good enough for me to spend eternity on a white cloud, it was time for me to go \u00a0back and live out my last days extolling the virtues of Scoma's. Back in the booth I ordered dessert. Best bread pudding ever. I looked skyward but his Holiness already knew it was that good. Not only that but the service is impeccable. Our server knew exactly what wine would go well with our various dishes but he cracked a few jokes and provided just enough attention to not feel abandoned or rushed to leave.

It makes for uncomfortable seating and difficult for discussions. If I would have known they were going to sit us there, I would have suggested that we wait for another table. Our food was delicious. We ordered: trio of Pacific oysters on the half shell, oyster Rockefeller Alla Scoma, lobster bisque, swordfish with white wine sauce, lobster ravioli, seared Ahi tuna, 2 pound king crab with an 8 oz filet and the special which was Fettuccine Del Mar. My lobster ravioli was rich and creamy. The ravioli was stuffed full of lobster meat which was nice. John was our server and was knowledgeable and accommodating.

As far as the quality of the seafood, the restaurant has a fish receiving station outside in the pier. If they didn't get it on the dock, they can tell you exactly where it came from.  I had the clam chowder, which is New England style. It was very rich and thick with distinguishable chunks of clam. I liked it more with every bite that I took. The seafood salad had a ton of meat, much more than I could eat after polishing off the chowder. That was fine though since I wasn't too thrilled with the salad itself. At least the seafood on top was good. I had chocolate tort for \u00a0dessert. It was served with a raspberry pur\u00e9e, which made the dish sort of tasty. In this case \"sort of tasty\" isn't a dig on the dessert so much as a statement about the fact that I don't typically like chocolate tort, but since the lunch special included a Chef's choice dessert, it was his selection not mine. I was surprised at how much of the tort I ate before the richness of the chocolate began to wear on me.  All in all I was very happy with Scoma's. It was a little pricey for lunch, but the food was worth it. If I had paid much more though, I probably would have dropped a star.",

We ordered our drinks and the trio appetizer which was shrimp, calamari, and crab cakes. I was already VERY impressed just by the appetizer it was delicious! I could not decide what to order for my entree because everything sounded soo good. I asked the waiters opinion on the 2 options I was stuck on, and he convinced me to go with the lobster ravioli and white mexican prawns. I was not disappointed when I got this dish, it was even better than the first one!  The sauce on the raviolis was creamy but not too rich to the point where you feel sick after you eat it. The prawns were huge and grilled to perfection. Overall this is probably one of the best dinners I've ever had. I was also satisfied with the service, (I cant stand lousy customer service).

I wanted to try abalone, but it wasn't on the menu. I got a cup of clam chowder (had to salt it to add flavor and the clams were chewy), and I got seared ahi tuna that had no seasoning whatsoever. My daughter got a hamburger and wouldn't eat a bite of it after her first taste. It wasn't just that it didn't meet my expectations, it just didn't meet basic good food quality. I have had better ahi tuna in many a place in San Jose.  Our server didn't show up for quite some time after we sat and was not attentive at first, then he noticed how cute my daughter is and started to engage with us, but it was too little too late.",

I wouldn't have found this place if it wasn't for the recommendation. The average age of the customer is in their old 50's. so it's a older crowd kinda place. I think you'll have more fun eating outside where all the buzz are happening if younger than 50.   This was my 4th meal of the day (it's about 5:00pm at this time), so I only crabbed a half dozen oyster and a cup of clam chowder. For $18.00, you get 6 oysters on your plate. It's definitely not the best oyster I have, but satisfy the craving at that time. The claim chowder is not special at all either; just like any other claim chowder.   Now, on to the service here, it SUCKS. It's an old old restaurant trying to \"pretend\" they're a high class restaurant; trying a little too hard to be an expensive restaurant. The average age of the waiter is around 50 years old too, which suits the average age of the customers. The host; however, were younger (early 20's). They talked and talked and talked among themselves the whole time rather than informing their customers why they had to wait so long for a table. I waited 20 minutes at 4:00pm for a table when more than half of the restaurant is empty.   Tip: Don't come here, no need to come here. It's boring and suffocating in here. Much more fun sitting on the busy street eating and watch the crowd.",

After a very long wait a Saturday night (30+minutes), they generously gave us a window table so we could see a bit of the bay/sunset.  Appetizer  Calamari- best ever and best dish of the night to me!!! So perfectly crispy and well-seasoned without being too heavy.  Comes with a very delicious tartar sauce and spicy tomato-based sauce.   Entrees  Mussels in white wine/garlic sauce instead of a tomato-base- very very good, the sauce was more of an afterthought but the mussels were very fresh. I liked this base much more than the cioppino.  Cioppino- Great seafood, but not the best tomato sauce (too watery, not memorable in terms of taste). Since the sauce was so bland and the dish was hyped so much I had really high expectations and though the seafood itself was steamed/cooked well I would not order it again. Nothing in the soupy sauce enhanced the seafood to me.   Wonderful free Birthday dessert:)!!!! Splendidly rich fudge cake with some whip cream, raspberry sauce, and powdered sugar.  Fantastic serivce once we were seated (water filled all the time, wonderfully kind waitress) and ambiance overall. Will come back for the Calamari whenever I'm in SF:)!!",

    "review_text": "When in San Francisco, go with seafood. On a referral from my boss, Scoma's was the place to go. Situated in the wharf area, Scoma's is tucked away from the street, almost secluded. They process the seafood on premises - cleaning, filleting, etc. You can watch them through a picture-glass window right next to the restaurant. The interior design is nautically themed, yet classic. A long bar is near the entrance where you can have a libation while waiting for your table. The dining room is beautiful with glass on both sides of the restaurant. While there's not much to see at night, we did watch seagulls perch on the wooden wharf beams outside watching us eat our dinner. I love clam chowder and it is usually one of my staples that I use to test the level of the food. This has to be the best clam chowder I've ever had! It's creamy, buttery, and chocked full of clams. It was held and served at the perfect temperature so the cream didn't break. I worked with clam chowder for 9 years at Disneyland and you really had to watch the holding temperature. Once the cream breaks, the soup loses its creamy texture (almost like curdled milk) and needs to be discarded. The fresh cracked black pepper on top sealed the deal. Scoma's, you had me at \"clam chowder\"! I decided to try something off of their daily special menu, Lobster Raviolis topped with lobster tail and salmon fillet. It was pretty good. The salmon needed a little more seasoning, but had a nice buttery flavor and soft texture. The lobster tail was tender and perfectly cooked. The raviolis were okay. I would have liked more herbs like tarragon, rosemary, and/or oregano to punch up the sauce as it was a little heavy. \u00a0My mom ordered the Dungeness Crab. \u00a0As it was summer, it was out of season so it was \"fresh frozen\". She was a little disappointed that she couldn't have the insides (miso or mustard of the crab) as they are cleaned out when prepped. Our server assured us that if we came back during Dungeness crab season that we could order it with the \"miso\" intact. She enjoyed every bit of it as it came out steaming hot and ate it to make our ohana proud, bib and all. Our meal ended with roses. A man proposed to his future bride that night. They were leaving on a flight back to China and couldn't take them. The staff gave us a couple to take back to our hotel room. They were beautiful!",

The restaurant was an average looking building, average decor with rickity cheap tables and chairs. Their highly rated lobster bisque was very mediocre with zero traces of real lobster. The calamari had way too much breading for how thinly sliced the actual squid was. The $17 shrimp cocktail with \"jumbo\" shrimp came with 6 average sized shrimp. While their fish was fresh, they made zero effort into cooking a good meal with it. We got the mixed platter with (teeny pieces of) swordfish, salmon and halibut. Each fish tasted exactly the same because it was purely just grilled - no spices, no sauces, just literally plain pieces of fish. It really says something about a seafood restaurant when my favorite thing of the meal was the mashed potatoes. Overall, just a big tourist trap getting you to pay double/triple the price for measly portions of very bland, generic food.  I don't mind shelling out for a good meal but when I spend more than $50 on dinner per person, I expect the quality of the food to match the price tag. I'm assuming most places around Fisherman's Wharf have fresh fish and I'd much rather go a chain like Joe's crab shack or Bubba Gump for a more fun experience at a fraction of the cost.",

Our server greeted us promptly and got us set up with a round of cocktails that we enjoyed while we decided what to order.   The beau and I shared a mixed green salad to start. For my main I ordered one of their daily catches, broiled (Halibut) and he ordered a bowl of their Clam Chowder.

His chowder was jam packed full of fresh clams and the bowl sized portion wasn't too gigantic.

    "review_text": "Ok so this would be more of a 4.5/5 stars, but yelp doesn't allow for it. This restaurant has been here for as long as I can remember. We used to come here every year. It was our go to place to bring family from out of town and it never failed to impress. If you want to eat at a decent time, make a reservation!! The wait on any given day can be 30 min to 2 hours.   If and when you do come you ABSOLUTELY MUST get the clam chowder because it is quite honestly the BEST I've ever had here in CA. The lobster bisque is also to die for (if I were any less civilized I would have licked the bowl). Their grilled scallops were amazing, fresh, and cooked to perfection. Personally I'm a sucker for cioppino and the one here is super tasty and loaded with seafood. Fish here is cooked perfectly - flaky and fresh (can't really go wrong with any fish you order). The seafood pastas here are enough to feed 2 comfortably and they are def not stingy on the seafood. Another must get is the calamari (they have spicy or regular) - so GOOD!! Perfectly crispy/seasoned on the outside and tender on the inside. \u00a0  Cons:  - Possible long wait times for tables  - On the pricey side (BUT totally worth the splurge - trust me!)  Pros: - Giant portion sizes  - Seafood is very fresh - Great atmosphere (slightly old fashioned, but classy) - Service is always top notch  - Free valet parking",

The filet was served with sides, hearty portions and a great sear. \u00a0The desserts were good, I especially enjoyed my tiramisu, fluffy and strong espresso flavor. \u00a0 \u00a0  It was a fun meal hosting out of town guests, but I wouldn't put myself through the ringer to eat here on a regular basis.",

    "review_text": "Father's Day 2014... \u00a0My wife and daughters brought me to Scoma's Restaurant because they thought I am the coolest Dad in the world, beating the likes of Cliff Huxtable, Tim Taylor, and Al Bundy. \u00a0I know they are just being kind because that distinction belongs to the one and only Homer Jay Simpson. \u00a0I probably am a distant second, but I don't mind taking a backseat to one S-M-R-T man.  For our dinner, we ordered a bowl of Scoma's Famous Clam Chowder, Calamari Fritti, the Prix Fixe Dinner, and the much heralded Lazy Man's Cioppino.  Scoma's Famous Clam Chowder is one of the better clam chowders not served in a sourdough bread. \u00a0It is the creamy kind with plenty of chopped up clams. \u00a0The Calamari Fritti was tender with a well-seasoned and crusty exterior. \u00a0The Prix Fixe Dinner consisted of Lobster Bisque with Lobster Salad and Chive Aioli as the appetizer, Calico Scallops and Fettuccini as the entr\u00e9e, and Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream as the dessert. \u00a0The appetizer was good but very minimal. \u00a0My daughter seemed to enjoy the entr\u00e9e which had sun-dried tomato and cream. \u00a0Everybody shared the dessert in a hurry to prevent the warm brownie from melting the ice cream. \u00a0The contrast in temperature made this so enjoyable.  Saving the best for the last, I have to give them props for their Lazy Man's Cioppino. \u00a0From the freshness of the ingredients to the taste of the broth, this has been the best of all the cioppinos we have tried. \u00a0This is a notch above my favorite at Woodhouse Fish Co. and I will pick this over Sotto Mare's self-proclaimed \"Best Damn Crab Cioppino\" any day. \u00a0Cioppino's at Jefferson St. has their lazy man's version as well but it is definitely not in the same class. \u00a0I have also recently tried the cioppino at Sam's Chowder House at Half Moon Bay, Vivolo's Chowder House at Pacific Grove, and Brophy Brothers at Santa Barbara and none of them came close. \u00a0I have yet to try Tadich Grill, Anchor Oyster Bar, or Crab House at Pier 39 so I will have to update this \u00a0when I get the chance to try theirs.  Dining at Scoma's can be costly but it is well worth the price especially when celebrating a special occasion. \u00a0This is worthy of a 5-star rating but I had to take away a star because they have that \"controversial\" 4% surcharge that some of the San Francisco restaurants collect supposedly for the health and welfare of their staff. \u00a0I think we have paid more than enough for the food, the tax, the tip, and even the to-go container that we don't want to see anymore surcharges on our bill. \u00a0Other than that, everything else went very well...",

The place is nice enough, beautifully placed and very quaint. We enjoyed the wine at the bar whilst waiting for our table.  We just went right into the meal and I had the cioppino and my wife had another seafood dish. It wasn't until after we had ordered that I was informed that there were no clams left. That meant there was no shell fish in the dish at all.  It was tasty enough, not fantastic, but for $37 I definitely felt short changed.",

Being from Hawaii, where tourism is an important industry, I understand attractions, cost, service, and other factors that go into making a visit a quality experience. So my humble opinion here comes a background that gives perspective.  SCOMA is located on a pier jutting out into SF Bay, away (behind) everything else at Fisherman's Wharf. If you're not looking for it, you'll probably miss it. The view of the bay and Golden Gate Bridge is fantastic from Fisherman's Wharf. Location: 4.5 Star.  Note, if you grab a seat at the bar, you'll have to clear the tab separate from your meal. SCOMA will improve it's service if customers can do a one-time-pay. When we were seated, Maitre d' and bar waitress miscommunicated and our transition from the bar area to sitting area was confusing. I ended up carrying our drinks to our table. Suggestion for SCOMA: When a customer is told there is a wait, offer the bar immediately as an option. Have a waithelp sit them and communicate with the wait help when the table is ready and allow the bar tab to be transferred to the meal tab. Pre-meal experience: 3 Star.  Now the highlight: Dinner. Our waiter, Simon, knows what it takes to put a smile on people's faces. He is very knowledgeable of the menu, pairings, and gifted at making people feel at ease. Simon, you ROCK!Service: 5 Star.  The overall experience was very good. The meal was very tasty; portions were HUGE. The price is a little high (est. @ $50 per person for one drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, and tip), but heck, you're on vacation, so plan on a splurge and this, in my humble opinion, is worth it.",

I ordered the \"ARANCINI DI RISO CON GRANCHI\" and thought that it was actually crab (legs), but it was just 2 small meatball type of things that was not worth $16. Probably my fault for being foolish listening to the waiter's recommendation.   Overall, everything is just too expensive here for what it's worth!",

    "review_text": "Let me start by saying that if this place wasn't so pricey it would have gotten 2 stars, even though that isn't really saying anything good.   My husband and I essentially just paid $80 for soup and iced tea, because those are the only two things we enjoyed.   We ordered the Swordfish and the Petrale Dore.   The Swordfish was slightly better than the Dore, but it tasted exactly like the pancetta it was cooked with. No one wants their fish to taste like pork.   My Dore was exactly what the menu said, so I guess it's my fault for thinking that they would make a fried piece of fish with lemon butter sauce in an inventive way and worthy of a $30 price tag...silly me. The sides also added absolutely nothing to the meal. They were steamed veggies and plain boiled penne pasta. I mean plain as in nothing on them, not even olive oil.   How this place has the reviews it has, I don't understand. Maybe we ordered the wrong things from the menu, but in my opinion, a restaurant at this price range and with this level of hype shouldn't have \"the wrong thing\".  Our waiter was pleasant, however, he only stopped by our table 4 times and 3 of them were to bring food and the check. He practically spent the entire length of our dinner in the corner with another table. It was a 6 top vs our 2, so I guess that was the smart move on his part in regards to tips. Oh and just a side note, my water glass was very very dirty, but I just switched with my hubby since he didn't drink his.  I am a true foodie at heart...and I absolutely will spend top dollar for a great meal without a second thought. But this meal actually ruined my night. I had my hopes set so high and was so excited, but was so let down. You can ask my husband...he even said I looked like someone stole my puppy (I told you a true foodie). I in no way, based on my experience, can recommend anyone to go here for anything other than the clam chowder. It, my husband said, was better than any he has had on the east coast. So that is the one star this place gets.   Lastly, if I haven't convinced you enough, another group walking from the restaurant down Jones actually gave away their leftovers to a homeless man, and he said it felt like an entire plate of food in the to-go box. So, I guess they didn't enjoy theirs either. We didn't even bother taking ours to-go.  Moral of this story: Save your money and time, go to Aliotos crab stand, and order a crab salad sandwich for $7. We had that for lunch today, and it was 10X's better and 10X's cheaper than what we were just served at Scoma's.",

After he took us to a few wine bars he inquired about our lust for seafood and asked if he could suggest a spot, so we obliged and he took us to Scoma, but not before making sure a table was ready for us.

WHo were we to ignore not one but two mutual suggestions, so off we were to search for Scoma's. To get here you had to walk past the tempting crab and chowder stands. Scoma's is kinda hidden but you'll see an alley and it over at the right by the docks.   What we ballers on a budget had a cup of chowder each, relatively small portion for $6, the next step up was a bowl for $8. We also had a sampler plate of appetizers. It was our version of what we would have ordered at the stands except in a nice sit down restaurant.  The chowder: I could see why Scoma's was recommended, the chowder had big chunk of tender red clams, potatoes, celery bits and I believed scallops as well. It was definitely very chunky. \u00a0Good flavor and just the right amount of seasoning.  The appetizer plate: crab cakes, deep fried calamari, shrimp scampi. $16.

When you order crab, they also put on bibs for you.  Come here for the clam chowder! It's amazing! Not too creamy or too watery. I was going to take a picture of it but I ended up just eating the whole thing. They chop up the clams, potatoes, and celery into small pieces so with every spoonful you get like a mouthful of everything. There was other ingredients in there too but I was way too hungry to observe. You can tell everything is fresh and didn't just plop it out of a can. I got the bowl for $10 which they do give a large portion. They have the cup for $9 but there's a total size difference. So I would recommend to just get the bowl, it's much more worth it since they give you much more.  We also got two orders of the dungeness crab, which tasted alright. It wasn't anything special, but it tasted fresh and that's always good in my book.  Every thing arrived pretty fast, we didn't wait too long which was good. But then again, I guess it depends on the day.  I would have to come back here in the future to try other seafood dishes.  But yes, come for the clam chowder and you'll be happy you did!",

Any seafood restaurant that's located right off the Pier of the ocean is pretty much guaranteed a fresher than fresh selection of a variety of fish. You seriously have to pay close attention to where you are going if you've never been here before... It's tucked away in a side street so if you blink, you'll miss it!! Scoma's does not take reservations, so we made sure we got there right when dinner started, which was 5PM. This place gets a big phat star for FREE valet parking. Free valet in the city is un-heard of. We could tell that this place has been established from the smell, aged sea ship decor to the majority crowd of \"seasoned business men\" and \"old money\" types.  I was a little perturbed at the hostess, I was waiting patiently in line for my turn to put my name on the list for a table... I was standing right in front of her... She overlooked me... and tried to help the older couple BEHIND me. I had to raise my voice in order for her to aknowledge me. We waited for 25 minutes to get seated, but we were ok w/ it, they were really busy. I just made sure that the hostess didn't try to give our table to anyone that came in after us.   We decided to order from the pre-fix menu ($39.95 pp)  Me:  Appetizer - Lobster Bisque with Lobster Salad Entree - Broiled Colossal Prawns, Linguine Pomodoro w/ Pesto Garnish Dessert - Pumpkin Cheesecake with Pumpkin Seed Brittle  Man Friend: Appetizer - \u00a0Dungeness Crab Cake on Watercress Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette &amp; Remoulade Sauce Entree - Broiled Wild Pacific Swordfish with Tuscan White Beans, Pancetta, Tomatoes &amp; Organic Rainbow Chard Dessert - Walnut Brownie &amp; Triple Espresso Ice Cream with Caramel Sauce  The food was FANTASTIC and the service was more than exceptional. My brother and I treated our parents here for their 33rd Wedding Anniversary, they are huge fans of the food as well. So if you are ever in S.F and have a \u00a0tasting for some quality seafood, come to Scoma's.. you'll be glad you did.",

The Location: Very Good  Well, I stopped in on a night with a coworker and we ordered the calamari, lobster ravioli, and burger.  Lobster ravioli was so so, nothing special.  Calamari was a bit on the chewy side, how is this, i dunno...  Burger was surprisingly the best thing on the table, even though it was basically a single patty big mac. Same type of bun, lettuce, special sauce. The beef was actually pretty good. A shame they didn't spring for better bread.  Will I return, not likely.",

San Francisco was first point on our honeymoon and we wanted to have a nice, romantic dinner so we made reservations at this place. It sits on a pier and does not look like much, but the food was phenomenal. My husband does not really eat fish, but he had local cod which he enjoyed very much. I had salmon caught by Scoma's own boat, which was magnificant. We also shared a bottle of Scoma's brand wine which was pretty good and we received a complimentary dessert since we were on our honeymoon. The place is pricey, but every bit worth it. The wait staff is very curtious and professional and a poster child for how a waiter should look and behave. My husband collects pint glasses and asked the waiter how he can get a glass with their name on it. The waiter said that he will see what he can do and gave him the glass for free. This was a great start to our honeymoon!",

We were seated immediately in a funky little corner, but it beats waiting. After a few minutes of perusing the menus, the waiter came out and took our order.   We decided to have the sampler appetizer which had scampi, calamari, and crab cakes. I wasn't crazy about the crab cakes but the calamari was BOMB. The scampi was pretty good too, but the calamari had my taste buds in its little tentacles. \u00a0We were really hungry so we were also chomping away at the delicious sourdough bread they brought out.  After that, our dinner came. I got the crab, which was delicious. The shell was easy to crack which I love b/c crab cracking is not a specialty of mine. The man got the lobster thermador, and OMG it's a thing of beauty. It's a lobster tail with vegetables, scallions, and pasta covered in provolone cheese. It sounded strange to me so I didn't get it, but trust me, it works. I'm getting that next time!!   Service is very prompt, we didn't have any long waits at all.

Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, the Wharf??? NOPE.. this is a food only trip. \u00a0No tourist stuff here.. no time for that.... JUST FOOD, FOOD, and more FOOD... plus 12 hours of sleep to take breaks between the food.  Since our hotel was close by, we decided to pull from our best of Yelp SF list a reasonably priced seafood restaurant nearby. \u00a0Enter Scomas. \u00a0A kind of out of the way place near all the Pier 39 crap.. but far enough away where the food actually has to be good to attract people to come. \u00a0You could tell this was mainly a local's only kind of place... which is always a good sign. \u00a0Expect to pay $35-$50 per person here.. which is reasonable considering the food... fresh lobster, clams, scallops, crab, tuna, you get the idea... flavors aren't anything special... but the food is very fresh so not much needs to be added anyway. \u00a0As most white places often do.. the seafood is over-seasoned with way too much butter. \u00a0Kind of makes you feel a little ill after the meal. \u00a0What is it with non-asian restaurants and butter and seafood. \u00a0Enough already. \u00a0   Ambiance was nice... the place sits upon it's own Pier.. Pier 47 to be exact.. (that's 8 piers and 5,000 tourists north-west of Pier 39 if you are counting). SF bay on one side... and docked boats on the other - a kind of rustic oceanic feel.. the smell of the seawater helps prepare you for the seafood. \u00a0I think a nice place for a date... but nothing too fancy.. wouldn't go here for an anniversary or anything like that... just a nice night out. \u00a0  Service was really good... server was very knowledgeable and always was in the area if we needed anything. \u00a0 Overall... food was good, price was reasonable, service was really good... 3.7 stars. \u00a0If you are in the area of the Wharf, and looking for a nice dinner out - avoid the tourist holes. \u00a0 Scomas is a decent choice.",

There's one old guy waiter I love with a Greek first name (I wish I could remember it, maybe it's Cyril) he's very cool and efficient. Too bad there's another old guy waiter, in a different room, who can take forever to take your order. He doesn't thrill me, but, I still love being at Scoma's.   One night a table of older ladies from Florida sitting next to us were freaked out by the expensive prices on the menu, I'm sure seafood in Florida is cheaper. In addition, the wine-by-the glass list was too challenging for them because of the many choices and prices. The \u00a0waiter I like got frustrated with these unsophisticated ladies so in order to speed up their ordering (this restaurant is BUSY) he brought the complaining lady a glass of sauvignon blanc on-the-house and that shut them up enough to finally place their order. I loved that scene and had a giggle with my girlfriend about it. These Florida ladies were quite talkative with us about all kinds touristy things.  That's part of the fun of the place, there's always a boatload of tourists there intermingled among the locals. This restaurant is good enough to attract a local crowd too. I just love this place, despite its very expensive price tag. Some dishes on the menu are in the $30.00 range. It's an expensive price tag, but it's so fun.  I almost always order the roasted crab (lots of yummy butter, garlic and parsley). Sometimes I get the clams. I've never ordered desert, but they look large and decadent (old school things like brownies and ice cream). The food is NOT fancy modern California/French influenced stuff like you'd get in most great SF restaurants (which I love too), its just old school goodness. There's always a place in my heart for SF sentamentality.  You can't go wrong with the scenery either. I love Fisherman's Wharf because it feels like I'm on vacation even though I live in SF. It reminds me of my childhood driving from Berkeley with my family on special occasions with visiting out-of-town guests.   The bar is fun too, and you will inevitably be having at least one drink while waiting for your table. The bartender is a wisecracker with his constant puns - very corny but friendly. I've never made a reservation, I just walk in and wait for a table. Sometimes we walk around the Wharf while waiting for a table. It's a lot of fun.   Try Scoma's for your seafood cravings and pretend you're on vacation in your own sweet little crazy city. Then don't forget to go to Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum for a childish laugh afterwards.",

The Lobster Thermidore - equally stupendous. \u00a0It's a bit old school and old looking. \u00a0It's also a little touch to find (look for Scoma Way off the main street), but be prepared to drop some coin here. \u00a0At lunch time it was filled with locals who appear to visit several times a week. \u00a0We know why.",

    "review_text": "Quick Tip: Best place for seafood :)  A couple of years ago, my friends and I were walking along Fisherman's Wharf and we saw the sign for \"Scoma's.\" My friend said that it was on the Food Channel or something, and that it is highly rated so we decided to check it out. Fortunately, we were there for Dine About Town and were able to get a three course meal for a discounted price.  Ever since then, my boyfriend and I make it a point to go to Scoma's during Dine About Town. Why? Because 1.) It is the best seafood I have ever had. The clam chowder is awesome (and Boyfriend loves the lobster bisque), 2.) it's inexpensive for a three course meal and 3.) great setting. The waiters/waitresses are dressed in white tuxedo-like outfits. Very nice.  Despite the Dine About Town, if we were able to afford their dishes on a regular basis, I'd probably go there whenever I crave seafood. All the dishes are spunky, and they even suggest wine that goes well with your meal when you ask.   Portion size is excellent, so I have never left this place feeling disgustingly full or with a to-go bag. I always finish my meal.   After lunch/dinner, you can take a stroll along the wharf and admire the other places. Maybe buy a souvenir while you're at it :)",

    "review_text": "i really wanted to like this place, especially since a friend of mine ravesss about this place, but i was pretty disappointed. i think im done trying out places around the pier, all the restaurants ive been in the area just seem like tourist traps.  the restaurant does not take reservations, so expect at least a 25 minute wait even on a weekday. at least it has complimentary valet parking so you dont have to worry about that.   it's a good thing the boyfriend and i came for DAT because the dishes itself definitely was not worth its normal price... and as good as a deal it was for DAT, i still did not think it was worth it overall  from the DAT menu we got the lobster bisque and crab cakes for appetizers, scallop pasta and charbroiled ahi tuna for entree, brownie and espresso ice cream and raspberry cheesecake for dessert.  ive only had lobster bisque one other place (mccromick) and the one here at scoma's does not compare at all. i cant exactly determine what was different about it, but it didnt taste as good as the one before and i didnt like how the crab meat was minced. mccromick's bisque came with huge chunks of crab meat  the crab cakes were good. i did find a small piece of shell in it though.  i don't really recall what was in the scallop pasta, but i remember it was some kind of tomato based sauce which was a little too sour for my liking, but the scallops were so good! i don't really like scallops because all the ones i've tasted had rough textures, but this one was so soft!  now for the tuna.... on the DAT menu i wanted the tuna with blackened rice but i guess they changed it by the time i went. the tuna was really bland and you could completely taste the char. it was probably one of the worse ahi tuna dishes i've had.  the desserts were good, but nothing exceptional.  scoma's is a nice restaurant by the water, but with its price and mediocre food, i won't be returning here again nor recommending the place. sorry, i definitely had better seafood.",

I think I must have made a poor selection (lobster ravioli), but my husband got the everything platter and said there wasn't anything special about it flavor-wise. No real special attention to the dish. The wine selection was good but bottles were priced a little high-grant it we'd just purchased 4 cases at a local vineyard and were not in the mood to spend $68 on a bottle you can get for $20 down the road (so we didn't). We were also a little put out at how crass our waitress came across - she was up-selling every chance she got-and actually looking away when we didn't choose 5 courses with the highest dollar. The lobster bisque was good and so was the bread and the view was a tourist's dream. But if you're in it for the food, then you can get better flavors without paying Scoma's $120 (before tip) for two people. In fact, we had a delicious lunch at another nearby restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf the next day for about $30.",

Sure, the food sucks (hence the 2 stars) but they also had the amazing idea of moving us too and from to accomodate a bridal shower party! When I complained to the manager (nicely) she was defensive and rude, spouting \"I'm not the one who told you that you could be seated in this area\". \u00a0Sup wit that!  Anyways, the fetteccini was crappier than a $3 Lean Quisine and the other dinners I tried (NY steak, and \u00a0shrimp pasta) were average at best!  With so many places to eat at in San Francisco don't waste your time, money, and daily caloric intake on this place. I'm just sayin...",

My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and was thoroughly surprised by how delicious it was (coming from the east coast he was skeptical). He said it had the perfect balance of cream and lobster. He also ordered his first Dungeness crab and loved it. It comes with a side of either regular melted butter or garlic butter and he said the garlic butter was definitely the way to go.  If you aren't a seafood eater there are few options for you so i would suggest going elsewhere. They do seafood exceptionally well and that's definitely what you should come for.  As far as ambiance it seems to be on the fancier side though it's filled with tourists for afternoon lunch and it doesn't appear to enforce a dress code. I imagine that's different for the evenings. It's also situated back off the main drag basically in the marina which makes for some wonderful views and a quieter atmosphere.",

It was probably one of the best Crab Louie Salads I have ever had. We also ordered a mixed seafood saute, which was also incredible. It came with some rice and steamed veggies, and just delicious. The best part about Scoma's was how perfectly all the seafood was cooked - especially the scallops!  There was so much food that the 4 of us had some heavy to-go boxes and I had an amazing lunch and dinner the following day. I'm not easily impressed by seafood restaurants but Scoma's definitely gets my stamp of approval.  Major plus -- free valet :)",

As good as the food was, I feel hesitant to go back for a second visit. I expect kind and courteous service when eating at a nice restaurant like Scoma.

I forgot what it's called but it has lobster, crab, scallops  , shrimps, pasta and rice in it. I was first hesitant to order what the server suggested because I always know what to get and I'm not quite use to being told what to get. But soon as they serve my food, it smelled great and it tasted great! The portion was really big too! After that, they serve me a surprise birthday chocolate cake (on the house), I love how it's not too sweet, just perfect!   I want to talk about our server really quick, he is very nice and funny because he sang me the happy birthday song even it was just by himself singing. Lol Thank you, server!  The ambiance of the place is OK, it's dated and there are more oldies than young people. It's casual attire and the place is not too loud.

I guess I expected a lot from here considering it's one of the landmarks of SF/Fisherman's Wharf, so when the wait person forgot that one of the guest's appetizers and didn't bring it until the other two of us finished ours... -1 point.  One of us ordered clams on the half shell. \u00a0Super fresh, super big clams. \u00a0YUM!!! But, they weren't shucked at all... So, I got to watch one of my friends pry the suckers off of their scallops (those things that connect them to the shells) with his little fork. \u00a0Funny, but also not the norm, even at the most basic raw bar. \u00a0- another point.  However, the cioppino was delicious! \u00a0I am not sure if it was really $30 worth of deliciousness, considering a lot of it was filler (bay shrimps). \u00a0But the flavor was great and the portions big. \u00a0My girlfriend and I shared one and a salad and we were not able to finish.

Scoma's is the best of the lot, though the lot ain't good.  It'd be 3 or even 3.5 starworthy if it weren't so overpriced - by about 2x.  The service was very good and the view was cool. \u00a0But the food wasn't so good that I can remember what I had; but not so bad I can remember either. \u00a0All I remember is that it was really overpriced.  But, if I were a bettin' man, I'd bet is was fish. \u00a0Most likely.",

Best fried calamari I have had. And another 1.5 star for the trio appetizer the boyfriend and I had ordered.   As for my plate, the Sand Dab, it is usually a great tasting fish but what came with my fish was boiled Pennae pasta and over cooked asparagus. The sand dab did not have the garlic caper flavored sauce that the fish was to be cook in. Instead, it tasted like a light white fish in batter. I would call my sand dab, fancy fish filets or fish sticks. As for the Pennae it had no flavor. When I say boiled that's it. It was dry and had no seasoning. And as for my asparagus it was too mushy and soft. Not worth $30. I wish I ordered something else.   And I did not want to hurt my boyfriend's feelings cause he raved about this place being awesome, and that he wanted to take me here to try it out. So thanks to him, but I guess I wouldn't order the sand dab again. At least not here.   But overall, I will come back one more time in hopes I order something better and not be a disappointment.",

Scoma's was a little hard to find from the main Fisherman's Wharf area as one needs to walk down an alley towards the Pier 47 before finding the main entrance at the back of the restaurant.  The interior is upscale, classy, and dated. The host was in a full suit and the wait staff were all in white tuxedos. Our request for a table with a view was honored.   Our meal started off with bread which was the worst part of our meal. The bread was cold and stale. ...the butter was also cold and didn't even start to melt on the cold bread...  The appetizer sampler was out of this world! At $26, there was plenty of fried calamari which was super fresh, perfectly cooked (not rubbery) and lightly battered. The crab cakes were melt-in-your-mouth good and the shrimp scampi was delicious too! :D  The Lazy Man's Cioppino that our waiter and Yelpers raved about was over-rated and over-priced at $36. The seafood stew was okay. The best part was probably the garlic bread that was dipped into the marinara sauce.   Service was friendly by our waiter. He even brought and tied a bib around our neck, which was definitely a nice touch! :)",

We chose Scoma's. \u00a0Even though they don't take reservations and we were going to head down around 7:30, and new it would be a madhouse (which it was), we put in our name for a 45 minute wait and walked around a bit, had a drink. \u00a0We showed up after 40 minutes and were seated after waiting an additional 5. \u00a0Not Bad!  Bread was of course great. \u00a0Wine was flowing. \u00a0Appetizers of Calamari and Tuna were good. \u00a0Calamari was a bit tough, so I was wondering how long it had been frozen. \u00a0Tuna was fantastic.  One companion had swordfish and you could tell by the way she was laid back in her chair, grin on her face, and fork going at lightening speed she was a happy camper. \u00a0Two of us got the lazy man's cioppino, and it was full of amazing, well cooked fish (and at 1/2 pound of Crab, very satisfying). \u00a0The tomato broth was very rich - so not for the timid if you can't handle rich food. \u00a0The fourth diner had steak and jumbo prawns and again, huge smile on the face.  For dessert, had the strawberries and cream along with the Pecan Torte. \u00a0Both were great.  So if you are looking for a crowd pleaser and don't mind a wait, Scoma's is definitely a place to check out.",

Short wait and we were seated at a window table overlooking the docks. This was great since our 6yr old had something interesting to view... as well as us. The waiter was outstanding from the first greeting and gave my son some crayons and paper to keep him busy.  The menu is packed with all the favorites from Crab Luis to a variety of Risottos so it took some time for my wife to pick but I saw Cioppino right from the start and knew I must have it. She ordered a Scallop dish. The staff was VERY helpful with pointing out house specialties and favorites.  For starters we shared a plate of Oysters and Lobster Bisque. Both were excellent and the table bread was fresh and warm Boudin Sourdough. \u00a0As we finished the appetizers, we saw a huge bowl of large mussels delivered to the table next to us and my wife was bummed she didnt see that before she ordered . The waiter over heard \u00a0and said he would switch the order if she liked.   Great decision because those mussels were excellent. The Cioppino, well all I can say is top notch! I have been searching for the perfect bowl and found it. Tons of seafood in there, bay shrimp, prawns, scallops, clams, fish, and Dungeness Crab chunks. The broth was perfect as well.  For now on, every stop in San Fran will be a new ritual meal at Scoma's. Outstanding fresh food with the service to match. I read a lot of complaints of the prices but I feel you get (or exceed for that matter) what you pay for. Cant wait to get back.",

    "review_text": "Excellent old school seafood restaurant. This place isn't fancy (save for the classy white dinner jackets of the waiters) but it is pricey. It's definitely worth experiencing at least once since it's such an institution. The wait on a Saturday can be easily a hour or more without a reservation.  From the time you walk in until you walk out, you are greeted from friendly hostesses and waiters. The waiters are funny and know the right amount of attention to give you.  The shrimp cocktail starter is a bit pricey for what you get but it's solid and on par with the value at any other place that has something like it on the menu. The clam chowder is EXCELLENT and I recommend splitting a bowl for two if you are thinking of each getting a cup (they just give you 2 cups worth in a bowl for $2 more). There's a lot of clams in the chowder. This place overall gives big portions though you're paying for it.  The ciopinno is excellent though it's more about the parts than the whole. The broth is almost a tomato bisque and it is filled beautifully with large pieces of seafood excellently cooked. It's less about the stew mixed together like other places in North Beach.  The whole garlic roasted dungeness crab is amazing. It's generous size and well cut up and prepared.   Definitely worth trying once. I spotted the large size crab louie salad and was blown away by the sheer size of seafood -- must try it next time.",

The food and ambiance were both very good but I have to say that what stood out was the service.   Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we had a drink at the bar and spoke with Gige for a while. She told us a little about Scoma's history and took some time to go over the menu with us and show us some of her favorites as well as describing different dishes. She was so warm and nice and was everything you'd want a bartender to be in a classic old time San Francisco institution.   Our waiter Sonny was also incredibly nice and attentive. We were interested in hearing about the specials and he described them all in detail and said he HIGHLY recommended the halibut. We trusted him and it paid off big time - the halibut was absolutely fantastic and we wouldn't have gotten it without Sonny's suggestion.   My only criticism - and reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 - has to do with the way the menu was written. I had my heart set on the crab risotto and ordered it. When it arrived it it was filled with peas and mushrooms in addition to the crab. I don't like peas or mushrooms. And my issue is that it didn't say it was made with peas and mushrooms on the menu. I picked around as much as I could and it was very good. But it would have been great had I had some way of knowing to ask for no peas or mushrooms. Also had the clam chowder which was really great.",

They do not take reservations, but there was no wait for a party of 6 Sunday night at 6:30. Had we been a group of 3-4, there would have been a wait, but all of the larger tables were empty. So I guess if you don't want to wait, find some friends at the bar and see if you can't come up with a bigger group.  Cocktails were very good and I thought the bread was fresh and chewy. The portions here are enormous! I ordered the pasta garibaldi (linguine with salmon, scallops and mussels) in a sundried tomato pesto and could barely eat half. The sauce did not taste anything like sundried tomato pesto - in fact I'd be willing to bet money it was tomato sauce - but it was good, so whatever.  Others at the table got cioppino, crab spoon-bread, prawns and scallop platter, lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail. Everyone had good things to say about their food.  Service was ok - our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and left the table before everyone had a chance to order drinks. Water was refilled frequently and special requests were accommodated.  The atmosphere is really nice but the tables are much too close together. This would be a bad place for secret plotting, as the table next to you will 100% hear every word that you say.   Free valet is nice, but drive VERY slowly when entering and exiting their lot as it's one lane and a blind corner.",

The Hubs and I ate here on a Monday night earlier this month and we came early (6:30) since quite a few reviews mention a long wait for a table. On this particular night, there was no line outside and only a few parties inside waiting for a table. We were seated within 10 minutes. Our server arrived with menus shortly after we were seated and we chatted with her a bit. She was friendly and funny. We ordered martinis while we perused the menu. The drinks came out quickly and were perfect.   After lengthy consideration of the menu, we both ordered the Dungeness Crab Cocktail for an appetizer. For an entree, I ordered the Swordfish con Fagioli, and Hubs ordered the Broiled King Salmon and asked to substitute Swiss chard for the mashed potatoes and mixed veg that came with it.   The crab cocktails were delicious; the crabmeat was soooo fresh. The cocktail sauce was somewhat overpowering, though. Fortunately, it was underneath the crabmeat and I was able to avoid most of it. Then the entrees came out. The dish I ordered was supposed to be swordfish with white beans, Swiss chard and pancetta. For some reason, there was also a sizable blob of mashed potatoes in the bowl with everything else. Huh?? Anyway, I just ate around it. The fish was great - very fresh and perfectly cooked. The beans and chard were tasty, but a bit oversalted.   The problem with the server happened with my husband's dinner. When the entrees were set down, he was brought swordfish with the requested Swiss chard (instead of king salmon). When he brought the error to our server's attention, she said somewhat rudely (and I quote) \"No, you ordered swordfish.\" Not 'are you sure'? Not 'oh, I'm sorry'. That surprised the hell out of me. I mean, where did that friendly, fun gal go?? When Hubs said again that he ordered the salmon, she got pretty defensive and it was only when I confirmed that yes, he did in fact order salmon and I was the only one who ordered swordfish did she relent and say she would get the correct order out as quickly as possible. I mean really?! What kind of service is that?   When his salmon finally did come out about 10 minutes later, it was delicious and perfectly cooked (thank goodness), but having to sit there with my meal and slowly eating it before it got cold and him sitting there without his food kinda put the kibosh on the dining experience for me.   By the time our server came back later regarding dessert, she seemed to have regained her customer service skills and offered us a free dessert.   Anyway, I'd eat here again. I mean, one server's off night can't ruin the place for me forever (can it?).",

But it was definitely a close call of a long wait as the restaurant was already packed around 5pm.   The restaurant is literally by the ocean, on the pier &amp; they have their own fish receiving deck which ensures freshness. Inside, you can tell that it's old &amp; has been a popular restaurant for a long time; nothing fancy but something solid.   It took them a while to take our menu, bring out bread &amp; wines (we were starved from the drive up), and to receive the food.  BUT WOW! It was a great meal!!! Here's what we got. Fresh oysters - My sister &amp; I don't eat oysters but parents sure loved them! Crabs - Seafood lover mom &amp; I got crabs and yes.....................It was AMAZING! Lots of crabs that is fat to feed my hungry stomach! Once you see the portion, you know you will pay that money all over again because it was so well priced for that portion! Flavor was great too!!! Wow!!! Definitely not your typical 'just steamed' crabs! Must try!!! Because even my sister enjoyed it quite a lot! (she doesn't like seafood) Sauteed Scallops - Sis isn't a big fan of seafood so she got this which wasn't bad but for me? I would get crabs any other day! Alaskan King Salmon - Dad got the salmon &amp; it was FRESH! So clean &amp; juicy! Mmm~ But again, can't beat the crabs!   Overall, yes. We would return here anytime!",

I ordered the lobster bisque and I wished my portion was bigger because I really like it a lot. I was trying to save my soup as long as possible but it was difficult. I also had to share some with my boyfriend as well ! so definitely not enough. My boyfriend had the dungeness crab cakes - very yummy.   For entree, I was hoping they have the prawns with linguine like their menu on the dine about town website mentioned, but yesterday they had scallops with linguine which sounds just as good. I couldn't even finish my meal because it was quite a big portion. Very good but would like it more if there was more sauce. My boyfriend had the lamb t-bones which is really flavorful and juicy. Meat is tender and I only had one piece since I was way too full and wanted to leave a bit of room for dessert.  Dessert: I ordered the walnut brownie and triple espresso ice cream - yum yum yum. I did prefer my brownie to not have walnut but oh wells - I still love it a lot.   I actually been to this restaurant like 10 years ago with my family, but totally forgot till I was walking in the alley toward the restaurant. Our seats was not too great yesterday because we were sitting at the deepest corner ever with no window view of the water. I guess, next time!",

The seafood list is proper - not too long, but it covers the bases and reflects what's fresh and tasty. And boy is it ever. Really, go for the seafood, you'll love it. Read the rest of this if you're bored...  I liked the style of the place. Fancy, but not overly so, suggesting that food quality and service were most important, and looking overly fancy just for the sake of doing so was not - they know their food speaks for itself.  The service is good, friendly and knowledgeable. It was a bit slow when we went (my parents' last night visiting me in SF), but it was also the evening after the Nike Women's Marathon so everything everywhere was packed. (An aside: is it really necessary to wear your race number on top of your evening clothes? Do you really need me to know you ran? Isn't the satisfaction of finishing a marathon enough?)  Anyhow, really good seafood, not overly expensive, good service, and a nice out-of-the-way location so it feels like you're going to a 'secret' spot that most people who live in SF seem to know about (and love).  Oh, and try the fish, it's great.",

My boyfriend and I started off with the Mediterranean Mussels and it was amazing. One of the best mussels my boyfriend and I have ever had. It was lightly sauteed and steamed in a buttery wine sauce and it was simply amazing.  I had the Shellfish Saute and it was lightly seasoned so you could really taste the seafood itself. This dish comes with a generous amount of scallops, shrimps and I believe there was lobster in there. I had a side of veggies and pasta. I wished the pasta was seasoned or had some sauce with it to make the dish more flavorful. Overall, this dish wasn't heavily seasoned and so it was simple and plain. But the seafood was so fresh and so good that it made up for the lack of seasoning.  Overall, we will probably come back for the mussels and to try their other seafood selections.",

When a restaurant has its own Fish Receiving Station right next to the restaurant, you KNOW that the seafood would be the freshest if could ever be.  My parents came here on a Sunday for lunch and at noon, there were barely any free tables available. Make sure you get there early or make a reservation! By the time we left the restaurant around 1pm, there were so many people waiting for tables.  The three of us shared a Mixed Shellfish Platter for 2 which had clams, oysters and meaty chunks of crab. The freshness of the seafood was amazing and it was a great starter to our meal. For mains, I had the Crab Louis - their most popular lunch item. It was a massive mound of salad with a gigantic serving of crab. I love crab but this was just too much. It would be great to share it with somebody. My parents had the Scallop Saute and the Swordfish Piccata. The swordfish was pretty decent but the scallops were not so great.

The service was fine but the food was grossly overpriced - about double what you would pay at the wonderful Pacific Cafe, for less appetizing food. Kuleto's up the street is also cheaper and has amazing views of the GG Bridge. Even Alioto's #8 is better.  Anybody who dines here might as well be burning money.

Prawns, Shrimp, Clams, Sea Scallops, Fresh Fish &amp; Dungeness Crab all stewed together in a huge bowl of deliciousness... You could also opt for the Cioppino alla Pescatore which is exactly the same thing but you'll have to get your hands dirty cracking the crab open yourself.   This is by far the best Cioppino I have ever devoured. Nothing on the Wharf, both in SF, Monterey Bay or San Diego have even come close. All others fail in comparison... You get the picture... Oh, if you happen to swing by when they are offering Salmon as the catch of the day, OMG... It's luscious. Melts in your mouth. To quote Stewie Griffin, \"This Salmon is delightful...oh, this is like an orgy in my mouth!\" Enjoy!",

We'd already tripped down to Alamo Square so my mom could get pictures of the Painted Ladies, and up to Lombard to check out switchback alley (I mean the Crooked Street!) so the only thing to do from there was walk/run/jog down Hyde and head for lunch at Scoma's!   Ok, I've never been here, but the reviews are really great, and who doesn't love a little old school charm right along the waterfront? I knew we had to be in for something pretty great when I saw how many open seats a lot of the restaurants we passed had, and then how few there were at Scoma's. Maybe it's just good marketing?   The building is pretty unassuming, the interior however is all dark wood, low ceilings, and tablecloths. White shirted black pantsed men hover EVERYWHERE. We were seated quickly and brought menus. Drinks were ordered and bread was munched upon. Now, the ever important task of deciding what to eat!  Well...I had to try the cioppino...despite its' steep price tag. Seriously...40 bucks for soup? It's soup. Again, trusting to my reviewing counterparts, I just didn't see how I could turn it down. My mom was apparently feeling the soup vibes as well, so we both ordered it. My dad got a scallop/shrimp dish, and the boy got salmon fettuccine.   Oh. Holy. Crap. This soup was...ok, first off there's a ton of it. It should come with some kind of warning like Caution - Bowl Will Be Size of Your Head. I don't think I could have eaten this whole bowl if I'd starved myself for three days. As it was I barely got through half. My mom was the same way - if only we'd known, we could have split it! Dad loved his food - he felt they were a little chintzy with the scallops, but he really enjoyed the shrimp. The boy was just kinda meh on his salmon. I tasted a bite and I could tell why. Seasonings were a bit off, and, well...he's from Alaska, and has pretty high standards for smoked salmon.   The service was really on par. Our waiter was helpful and very chatty. I just wish he'd given us some indication about the enormity of soup that was coming our way.  I mean, by all means, get it. There's a ton of fish and crab and scallops and shrimp and everything under the sea. It's seasoned excellently. There's just so. so. much.  I felt bad cause we couldn't really take it with us, given all the sightseeing still left to do, but...yeah.  The place is legit, the food is stellar and plentiful, and the servers are excellent. Totally go here. Bring your family.",

    "review_text": "This has been like #1 on my list of TO TRY restaurants, since I'm such a big fan of seafood. And sadly, I would have to say that I have been somewhat disappointed. I had called in a while back to inquire about a possible reservation for a larger party (since they don't normally take reservations with the exception of larger parties). I was told that it was something called preferred seating, where my group could be sat half an hour after our arrival. I was told to call back to confirm the number of people the day of, which I did. I had spoken with Nick (the man to go to), and he had been quite pleasant both times. He said that it wasn't a problem. My original suggestion was that I wanted to make it for 8:00, but since he had told me we'd be sat about half an hour after, I told him 7:30 instead and he said that was great. But sadly, even though we started arriving at 7:10, with basically only one person to wait on by 7:45 and all arrived before 8:00, we did not get sat until almost 8:45. Yes, I understand that restaurants do have their problems with turn-over times, guests arriving late and all that crap, but it was too long compared to what I bargained for. And as much as I'd like to like Nick, he did not speak with me even once throughout the wait or our entire session there (although he knew I was there and all of us impatiently waiting). But that is fine, he is not who I want to complain about. MY ENTIRE PARTY of 14 had something to say about the hostess. I mean, she sounded RUDE on the phone, but she was even WORST to deal with in person! She does not qualify to be an hostess!! Everytime I approached her, she either didn't bother to look over for the longest time, didn't bother to let me know when we were going to be seated or gave us the \"soon\" answer which was of course an hour and a half later. I was not the only one that could read the rude and incompetent expression on her face. Yes, everybody (without me commenting) said that she was a total bitch. I cannot believe that a decent restaurant like this would have a hostess like that!  Now after all the complaints, lets go to judging the food and what I do like. One member didn't like the clam chowder, while the other really did. I heard that the squash soup was good, and my lobster bisque was just alright. I'm guessing.. its fine to stay away from the soups. I heard no other complaints throughout the whole night, so I'm guessing what they ordered were good. I had some of the crab cake dinner, and it was good but not too memorable. I did remember the chunks of crab though, so thats a good sign. There were also wonderful compliments on the lobster thermidor I ordered, but I actually liked the one over at Crab House better. The lobster ravioli got major approval from my friend and myself, so I would have to say that's the dish I'd definitely order again.  I ordered the tiramisu and it looked absolutely wonderful, with an edible chocolate spoon even (which I gave away). It tasted good, but I'm not sure if its real, traditional tiramisu. Because our server later found out that it was my birthday, he also came out with a chocolate marquise, which was very good indeed.  At first there were some looks around the table because our server had such an heavy accent (French perhaps), it was a bit difficult to understand. But I thought that he was absolutely wonderful and I think he grew on everybody as dinner went on through the night. He was so nice and he kept checking in with us and asking us if we had any questions.  There was a view I believe in the room we had, but it was pretty dark and I didn't pay much attention. This restaurant has potential, but I'm really not feeling the no reservation policy. On top of that, our semi-reservation turned into a mess. I would've given this place a 3.5 star, but the hostess totally takes a whole star away if not more. I did like our server though, so I'll just leave it at a 3. And plus, they do have free valet parking.  I'd probably come back here.. but they seriously need to fire Miss Hostess over there.  P.S. some of their other bussers/waiters/waitresses were quite nice as well. They weren't impatient with us at all (when we were basically the last ones left in the restaurant).",

We got calamari frutti dinner, pasta alla scoma, and \"lazy man's\" cioppino. Two girls ordering three main dishes must have confused the waiter. She was like, \"You girls are ordering too much..?\" Ha Ha.   The calamari was really good, it came with rice, penn pasta (why..?), and steamed veggies. We both liked it. Pasta alla scoma was not so great. Pasta was overcooked and I thought my teeth would break from all the lil rocks/sand from my clams .. However, The biggest disappoint of this experience was the cioppino. After seeing a lot of reviewers raving about how excellent this was, I decided to get it and ugh what a waste it turned out to be. It's way salty. Basically, it's a \"lazy\" dish with bunch of seafoods thrown in a marinara sauce. SALTY. I literally drank 4 cups of water just to eat the swimming seafoods.   Although the food we got sucked.. Atmosphere is great here. All the waiters seem really veteran and know what they are doing. I think we just chose bad food perhaps..

I was afraid the food and service might have declined as locals often refer to Scoma's as a place for grandparents and tourists. Not so! The food and service were excellent! We came at 5:30 pm, the time of our reservation and had our table of four until the place was nearly closed. Staff understood that I was having a \"reunion\" with a friend I had not seen since graduating girl's school 40 years ago. So they just let us and our families feel right at home without trying to push us out of our table to accommodate another set of diners.Surprising ,since the place was packed that night. One other notable aspect of service: the waitpersons are trained in proper wine service which includes wine pairing, presentation, opening and pouring...and by wine pairing I mean not only pairing to the food but also to what they perceive as your price point without asking. Our server got it all correct. I am a Court of Master Sommeliers (Level 2) Certified Sommelier and am Advanced Certified by WSET (Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust). I am so tired of going out to dine in San Francisco and watching servers who know nothing about wine or wine service try to upsell me on wine...and then botching service Thanks, Scoma's and Mathew (our server) for getting it right! My partner and I are locals and we will be back dining at your wonderful restaurant!",

This place seems like it's always busy so luckily I had made reservations.  Our waiter was very friendly and quite entertaining - A+  I ordered the mixed seafood grill which came with \u00a0I believe 4 small filets of different fishes. \u00a0 It was quite good, \u00a0not amazing but definitely enjoyable. \u00a0  My wife got the dungeness crab risotto which was really more of a rice/stew concoction then a traditional risotto. \u00a0 It was quite wet for a risotto and came with a lot of green peas. \u00a0 I thought it was an OK dish although whenever i order risotto i expect traditional style risotto that's pretty much dry and infused with sticks of butter.  Several of my friends got the cioppino and they loved it. \u00a0 It was quite a large bowl filled with plenty of seafood. \u00a0 Personally I felt the cioppino was a little too thick....they put a whole boatload of tomato paste in it.  Overall, \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good seafood in SF. \u00a0 The excellent location also means you can traverse through Fisherman's Wharf either before or after your meal.",

Enter Scoma's. \u00a0I'm sure they have a lot of outstanding seafood here, including Dungeness crab, but this place is all about the Lazy Man's Cioppino.  Cod, scallops, clams, shrimp, crab, mussels. \u00a0It's all here in a tomato based broth. THIS is the best stew I've ever had in any form. \u00a0They serve it with a big wedge of San Francisco sour dough for dipping but, if you're lucky, as I was, your waiter might just bring you a little side of pasta on the house to further soak up all that broth.  After all, those of us here in the east are used to melding our fish based stews with tomato sauce and pasta! \u00a0It's the ideal way to go!  Scoma's also has a 1970's based decor because it looks like they've never updated anything since then. \u00a0That's OK. \u00a0I love 70's style chic.

    "review_text": "There are tons of reviews for this place here, so let me try to break it down from an overall view and based on the reviews here and my experience at lunch - Scoma's is the kind of place that if you're not in the mood for their particular style or ambiance at that moment, you'll probably dock it stars. \u00a0It's a \"yes, but\" place. \u00a0Is it kind of too expensive? Yes, but the seafood is cooked expertly. \u00a0Is it kind of a tourist trap? Yes, but if you're at the wharf, you're much better off at Scoma's than anywhere else. \u00a0Is this waterfront view actually of a parking lot? Yes, but the scene is dripping with nostalgia, as if Frank Sinatra was mere seconds away from whisking in and ordering a Dungeoness Crabs Louis. \u00a0If you are looking for solid seafood, old school charmers of waiters in a location that is patronized by the retired set, for a classy lunch or dinner, this is the place for you. \u00a0Sometimes you want a Big Mac and sometimes you want Chateaubriand - this is not the place to hit up when you are craving a bread bowl of clam chowder or a deal on a seafood plate.  We came for an early lunch and enjoyed the stroll down the pier to get to the place, passing boats in their slips and a few picturesque views of the bay. \u00a0We were seated immediately, although I could see how this place would warrant a reservation in the evenings. \u00a0Our waiter was prompt and charming, but definitely trying to upsell us on the dishes. \u00a0We didn't choose the Prix Fixe Lunch Menu (which is a steal if there is something that you want on there - still, why the hell would I go to Scoma's for a club sandwich???) but we didn't think that a $50 mixed seafood plate was what we wanted either, even though the waiter was pushing us to get it. \u00a0We ended up getting cups of the clam chowder (Excellent balance of cream and a multitude of tender clams), the crab cake appetizer (Good with not too much filler - I like my crab cakes held together by sheer will instead of any filler, so these don't get an A, particularly for the price), the oysters rockefeller (Cheesy, lemony spinach goodness over plump oysters - but wait! They aren't in shells? I'm guessing these oysters came to the kitchen pre-shucked. \u00a0Again, not bad but these should be freshly shucked for the price) and a Mixed Seafood Pasta Dish that I think the waiter just made up. \u00a0It was linguine with clams, crab, shrimp, scallops and baby lobster in a garlic cream sauce. \u00a0Turns out the pasta was wholly irrelevant, and especially if you live for solid Italian food. \u00a0The sauce tasted of no garlic whatsoever, but featured strange chunks of onion instead. \u00a0I ended up pushing most of it to the side to get at the expertly cooked shellfish - it was truly the first time that I felt that the price tag was warranted in that my dish contained a hell of a lot of seafood, all with varied cooking times, and each and every piece was perfectly tender. \u00a0  Our bill was around $90 for the two of us for lunch - steep, but completely in line with what we were looking for for lunch and I have to say, I was so full that the treats on the pier didn't tempt me once and I was still pretty full come dinner time. \u00a0I'd probably return, but only if I was looking for a splurge and was in the area, and if I did, I would make sure to only order the strict seafood dishes.",

The place is very cute an the bartenders are friendly. I love how it's kind hidden off teh wharf and right next to the water oh a pier. We started out with a half dozen oysters. I had the cioppino and my bf had half a roast garlic dungeness crab and some clam chowder.  The oysters: Delicious. For $3 a piece, they better be!!!!! Clam chowder: YUM!!!  Now on to the bigger better things.. the Cioppino: Good, but Fish Market in San Mateo makes MUCH better cioppino. As much as I LOVE anything tomato, the consistency was more like that of a pasta sauce rather than a soup or stew. Though yummy, a little too hearty and takes away from the flavor of the seafood. For $40, I wasn't floored...  Roast garlic crab: Good, but better at Thanh Long....  I really liked the atmosphere of the place, and loved our Italian waiter who called me \"Bella\", didn't catch his name, but he was great.  Overall, Scomas is good, but not as good as I expected. We'll probably stick to our usual favorite spots for Cioppino (Fish Market) and crab (Thanh Long).",

Less remarkable was my dinner salad, which was great... but paled in comparison to my Cioppino. \u00a0The balsamic dressing was tangy and delicious. \u00a0Also worth mention -- the bread. \u00a0My server dropped off a gigantic loaf of delicious sour-dough bread.

Since there are so many reviews, I'll keep this short; unless you have a particular fish or seafood that you love (salmon, shrimp, etc.) you should go with the more mixture based dishes like the Shellfish Saute or the Cioppino- both absolutely delicious and top notch quality.  The good: You can really go to Scoma's in jeans and a dress shirt and you'll blend right in with the tourists. Servers are all nicely clad in ties and crisp white shirts, and everything from the fresh sourdough to the ocean smelling seafood is absolutely worth the higher price.  The bad: It's a long wait with no reservations taken, so get there early! Also, the desserts are meh but that's ok because they're not the main attraction.  Ambiance: Comfortable Italian restaurant. The focus is the food!  What to know: this is a place tourists are aware of, so beware going for dinner on weekend nights! If you're lucky enough to grab a table by the bar, you can munch on appetizers or enjoy some drinks to survive the wait.  Good for: family, friends, and out of towners.   In short: Scoma's serves super fresh and tasty sea food for a slightly hefty but very worth it place. One of my go to's for bay area vacations!",

After 45 minutes, the hostess said \"just another few minutes\".  After an hour of waiting, we were seated in the back portion of the restaurant, near a bus station. The bad part about this area is that there is a door that the waiters use to step outside and smoke. Unfortunately, they don't shut this door when they smoke and the smoke travels back into the restaurant. I mentioned this to our waiter, who basically ignored me.  The food was average.

I asked the 'keep if he needed us to settle or if we could carry the check to our table. \u00a0He looked at me like I had three heads and told me no, I needed to pay for my drink here. \u00a0ok ... so I ask for a check. \u00a0I got this gruff attitude, and he sticks the check in a plastic cup in front of the two of us and turns his back. \u00a0We know we are about to be called, so I put a bill in the cup. \u00a0From the size of the bill, I clearly had change coming, but the guy ignored it. \u00a0the cup sat. \u00a0our name was called and I was forced to flag him down. \u00a0It all felt kind of icky. \u00a0What can I say ... gut feeling.  Lunch itself was also a letdown. \u00a0I had crab cakes (they don't have this as an entree, only an app, so no sides for me.) \u00a0The crab was tiny slivers in too much filler and there were several shells. \u00a0Nothing turns off crab-cake love faster than shells. \u00a0His fish was .... meh. \u00a0Literally nothing to mention one way or the other, totally forgettable. \u00a0And if I can't even remember dessert (I can't, even looking at the menu) I can promise you it's bad. \u00a0b-a-n-a-n-a-s bad. \u00a0  Prices are just too high for the quality and service. \u00a0Scoma's is really not what it pretends to be. \u00a0There is so much potential ... a magnificent view if you are lucky to snag a window table, and a better than prime location. \u00a0but other than that, Scoma's feels run down and in need of some reworking.",

    "review_text": "Several other reviews have noted the general aesthetics of this restaurant as particularly dated. They are not inaccurate but with good company old can become charming. It is old but it does have some charm. The location is right in the heart of the tourist area but using the restaurant front free valet is great once you get there. The front desk host quickly seated us a few minutes before our scheduled reservation and the waitress and buss staff were very attentive throughout our meal. No hard drinks tonight but our waters and iced tea never went much below half with very timely refills. Our server did not make any recommendations but did compliment our choices. To start we shared the crab cocktail, it was terrific and the small additional \"mix your own\" cocktail sauce on the side was perfect for us as I liked a bit heavier hand with the horseradish. We then both decided on the lazy man's dish. 3 clams, 3 large scallops, 3 jumbo shrimp, lots of bay shrimp and crab meat and lots of fish made for an especially large portion neither of us finished. The crusty, buttery, sourdough bread half slice crouton was very good also. The stew base was a bit too one-note tomato-ey especially since there was just so much of it but it wasn't bad...just too much to finish without other flavor. Nothing on the dessert menu really called to us but we split the ice cream and brownie dessert anyway as this outing was a special occasion. The brownie was forgettable but the ice cream was really good. The total bill was what we would have expected for the tourist area and the fresh fish, pricey but not terrible. Service throughout the evening was terrific. The valet was prompt getting our car and we were headed home. My wife and I enjoyed Scoma's and both agreed we would come back but we'd likely someplace else we love or someplace new first. Additional note: because the dining rooms are tight, smaller parties might have a better overall experience than larger ones. In the room we dined there was only 2 tables for 2 and 2 tables for 4 so the noise was a dull din and the space between parties was acceptable. Bigger groups will make this impossible and I would imagine trying to have a cross table conversation would be impossible. \u00a0Perhaps you could specify where you would prefer to sit in your reservations...also reservations highly recommended.",

We took our drinks to Scoma's and upon our arrival, the host said that we couldn't bring our drinks from Starbuck's in with us. No sign stating \"NO OUTSIDE DRINKS ALLOWED\" was visible. Once we explained the situation that we were in, the host reluctantly allowed us to bring our drinks, provided that we didn't consume them during our meal. \u00a0Additionally, the host spoke to us in a manner befitting young children! I'm 38 and my girlfriend is 32. It was a very embarrassing way to be treated by a restaurant that's hosted celebrities from Alan Shepard and Cheech Marin to the great Frank Sinatra!

I expected a creamy subtle plate for my crab risotto, but receieved a robust bowl with mushrooms and peas and tomatoes and large pieces of crab.   I had to wait a while, even though I dined alone. I think that's a good sign.",

The entrees were okay, which is why I only gave it 3 stars, I had the lamb chops and my friend had the swordfish (maybe it was their dine about town menu? but not impressed at all)  The desserts were actually very good, we had the cheesecake and the bread pudding. The bread pudding was our favorite, it was warm and made with sour dough bread. If you like contrasting textures and flavors this is a most.  Another reason for the4 3 star was because I felt that the podium where you checked in was crazy tall, I mean I know I'm short but I had to be on my tip toes to give my name... ..",

Having grown up on the Chesapeake Bay, I've never had \"roasted\" crab, so this was a fun treat. \u00a0  I would definitely eat there again, if I ever make my way back out to San Francisco!",

Though I forgot the restaurant's name, I google mapped the path and found it.  Last week I waited 1 hour in line and it's absolutely worth it because the dungeness crab season is just back! Order the Garlic-Roasted dungeness crab and it never fails you, never!",

Baked Crab=amazing Oysters= nice variety and for oyster lover its awesome Cioppino=amazing (and very large good for 2 people) Scallops= cooked to perfection Calamari-amazing  maybe the dirty martinis helped but this place is worth the wait everytime",
