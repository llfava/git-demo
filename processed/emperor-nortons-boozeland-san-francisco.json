This is a great place for GROUPS. \u00a0I totally encourage drunken debauchery with CROWDS of people here.. they seriously have the space! \u00a0I didn't wander downstairs because it was COLD, but saw a stairway leading to what looks like OUTDOOR patio seating ...SCHWEEET! \u00a0  I ordered Henny because I was too much of a wuss to try the ORANGE PUNCH. \u00a0I'm sure I would have been a TKO if I had gone that direction even if watered down.  Of course, the neighborhood can be a little \"iffy\" at night, but it's up and coming (like the Jefferson's...) and I totally loved it that when I walked in the door there was a HELLA cute pitbull with a huge head wagging its tail greeting me and trying to kiss me. \u00a0AWWWW --- AWWWW...",

He actually was clever enough to effectively read people and believe that I'm an artist and have lived in Little Saigon for, well, a hell of a long time.  Being a mannered man he bought the first drink.  That is the sign of a good and serious bar-tender.  They want neighbors to drop in. We neighbors \u00a0have friends, relatives and in my case a weekly public access TV show (Dee Dee TV Saturdays 11pm Ch 29, streaming) that nobody has watched every week since 1995 but still people seem to listen to me!  I drank the free wine and the second one cost SIX BUCKS That right there shows they are real! Real about getting chicks in the bar. Chicks like wine. Chicks don't like 10 dollar basic wine at least not this chick. If I am paying 10 bucks for a basic glass of wine it'd better be served by a half-naked man who does hair and nails.  Shared the table with some ladies who were \u00a0plus size. More realness! \u00a0 Anorexic SF gals are usually tweeking \u00a0big girls are more relaxed and I wanted to keep drinking cause it was so relaxing the vibe is cool but I stopped at 2 and I want to go there right now but I'm finishing a Trader Joes bottle and watching PBS \u00a0and will visit ENB \u00a0this week but don't listen to me I've only lived in San Francisco since 1984.",

Since you found out about this particular class from a flier posted on the message board of your local laundromat - in-between a flier for a lost overweight Persian cat named \"His Meowjesty,\" and a coupon for \"15% Off Sapphire North's 30 Minute Spiritual Psychic Healing Session\" - it really doesn't surprise you when your class ends up being in the back of a \u00a0white 1984 windowless Ford Econoline van parked at the corner of 6th and Mission.   \"Can anyone tell me the first rule of improv?\" your instructor, Christian Lightning, a part time magician and two-time felon, asks to the group, as he takes a slow drag from a glass stem connected to a hollow bulb, filled with a rocky substance. Your classmates, a malnourished Mexican foreign exchange student who misses his pet turtle, a recently married lesbian couple from Texas who own and operate the largest iguana farm in California, and that old-timey villain who ties ladies to railroad tracks, all shake their head side to side in a 'no' fashion.   \"Yes and pass,\" Christian says, and hands you the glass pipe. \"Never forget that.\"   Two hours later you will all be arrested for smoking meth in the back of a van. Your improv instructor will have to serve some heavy time since he was on parole.  Because you've read Tina Fey's \"Bossy Pants\" you are pretty sure you can organize your own improv class. Invite all of your old classmates over to Emperor Norton's Boozeland, which is the raddest new bar in the city and the perfect spot for starting a comedy troupe. A pool table, shuffleboard, patio, whiskey, tables, booths, beer and bears oh my it has everything. \"This is the bar Gotham deserves, and also the one it needs,\" you think to yourself. So we'll drink there. Because this bar can take it. Because it's not our hero. It's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight. \"You know that day that you once told me about, when Gotham would no longer need Batman? It's coming,\" you say to your group, as you take a pull from the glass pipe.  \"AND SCENE! AND SCENE! AND SCENE!\" you hear your classmates yelling at you, which has become code word for \"Stop smoking all the meth!\"   It's then that you take a cold hard look at yourself in the mirror that's mounted above one of the greatest booth seating areas of any bar you've been to and realize that you are wearing a Spiderman mask and one big plastic green Hulk glove on your left hand. Some dark knight you are.   \"And scene indeed...\" you whisper to yourself, crushing the meth pipe in your Hulk glove and vowing to never do improv again, as you walk out of one of the coolest bars in the city.",

Every time I tell people I was here, they seem intrigued by the name. \u00a0Granted, about three out of four times I have to clarify that this is the old location of Deco, which occupied the spot a few years back.  And, truly, Emperor Norton, you built a solid empire of booze for fun-loving Civic Loiners to enjoy their libations. \u00a0There are four distinctly different areas to the bar, and there's a little something for everyone. \u00a0Want to go smoke on the back-patio? \u00a0Check. \u00a0Want to play some pool or shuffleboard? \u00a0Great game room/area. \u00a0Have a big group from work (hi, after-work lawyers)? \u00a0Big common area with TV's. \u00a0Just want to sit at the bar? \u00a0Heck, you can do that too.  Good beer selection, and reasonable HH specials until 7pm. \u00a0They open fairly early during the week (noon), so you can get a head-start if you wish. \u00a0I think it's a really good mix of clientele. \u00a0The space is really well decorated - they've done a great job.",

    "review_text": "After the fun/sh*tshow of opening night (which, full-disclosure, left one friend unable to remember how he got home, and me puking in the street - good times!) we decided to give it another go. There were nine of us, and we all fit into the cozy seating area upstairs. The outdoor area is cool to hang out in, too.  Surprisingly spacious, clean and dog-friendly. All good things.  Gotta say I really like this place. As long-time Bender's-ites, we knew the staff was cool, but they really seem in their element here (but what's with the happy, smiling, Kevin? Disconcerting!)  One star off because, seriously, WTF is up with the women's bathroom? The toilets are so high! Needing to be on my tiptoes to get to the seat is not cool!",

It didn't give me the $60 I requested but still took the money from my bank account - not okay! Luckily the bartender/owner is helping me deal with this ridiculous, sneaky ATM.  The bar has Photohunt, a pool table, shuffle board, and reasonably priced drinks. I'll come back but will get my cash elsewhere (and I'll save ATM receipts in the future if money does not come out!).",

    "review_text": "How could one possibly resist the allure of a kingdom known as Boozeland? \u00a0 If that's not the promise of a good time then nothing is!  So, this a new bar that's clearly owned and run by experienced, cool people. \u00a0They \u00a0know what they're doing and have clearly thought about their space. \u00a0The front section is a remodel / vast improvement of the place that was previously there. \u00a0Just that part is a great place to chill out and have a drink. \u00a0But follow me! \u00a0The good times continue in the back with shuffleboard, a sweet-ass purple pool table and a comfortable booth where you can share your most intimate, kinky, dirty, nasty secrets. \u00a0Or just a pitcher with friends. \u00a0Your choice.  Let's pretend for a moment that you get tired of shooting the shit, shooting pool and sipping delectable double IPAs. \u00a0You and I are probably not on speaking terms at this point, but let's pretend... \u00a0  You're in the 'Loin.  Ok. \u00a0 Feel like sitting outside?  Yup. \u00a0 Want to enjoy your cold beer, but don't want to be panhandled, accosted by crack zombies or hassled by \"the man\"? \u00a0 Fuckin' a right!  Where, oh where do you go? \u00a0 To the back patio! \u00a0 They have really thought of everything.  On a hot date? \u00a0Come and sip a cold one here with your hottie. Just got out of work and need liquid refreshment? \u00a0This place has it. \u00a0In glassware, son!  Oh, there's cool music on the jukebox too. \u00a0You can pick the songs while I beat you at pool. \u00a0Oh, thanks for the IPA! \u00a0How did you know? \u00a0Wait, how'd you just make those four balls? \u00a0Have I been drinking...?  What do you mean this review makes me look like an alcoholic? \u00a0I'll have you know, good sirs, that I only drink on days ending in y!",

    "review_text": "I used to love Deco and was sooo happy to hear that the place would re-open. Soooo much potential. Marlenas did something similar in Hayes valley and re opened as a \u00a0trendy spot Brass Tax. Unfortunately the same did not happen here.  The first time a group of us came back since the reOpen it was awesome. Cheapish drinks, fun pool table and awesome improvements to the outdoor patio. The bartender was way cool too. Dark hair and ?tattoos? I think.. Neway, this even was on a Sunday and was enjoyable enough for us to return the following Saturday. Waayyyyy different experience...  We arrived and noticed a different (completely wasted) bigger blond woman tending bar. We ordered a whiskey ginger and two last words (I was staring at the chartreuse and maraschino and it looked sooo good). She futsed around a bit and came back with the \u00a0whiskey ginger then went away. We waited...and waited... Then we made eye contact again and re ordered the drinks. She drunkenly rolled her eyes and told is she didn't know what that was. So we changed our order to two negronis.. Off she went..   She took a shot with a ?friend? Took another groups drink orders.. Nearly knocked over a bottle from the bar as she staggered to make someone else's drink. THIS WAS ALL AT 5pm!!! Holy smokes.. I'd bet she had a rough Sunday.. We cut our loses (time) and left. I was sooo hoping this would keep on being a cool place but apparently the staff (minus the awesome woman from the first night) are incompetent...The second star is for our first night and I won't be back unless I poke my head in and see her.. IF I happen to be in the neighborhood",

I liked the d\u00e9cor and felt there was plenty of room to sit comfortably. The prices were fair and poured well. They also offer a shuffleboard court in the back area.

Large selection of draft or bottled beer to accompany a full scale bar is nice. The place can get busy so coming a few drinks in, or early is a good choice. Did I mention Cash only? They have an atm but it charges you $3 and so do the bartenders when you ask for three different draft beers ... or she couldn't do math. One or the other. Overall a pretty chill place you can get a beer at with your friends or a date if you don't mind sitting on top of each other to hear what's going on.",

The tall bald guy had a massive meltdown over some shit one day I was in there, punching the bar and just acting like an idiot. I went in last night just to see what the male/female ratio was (fucking sausage fest) and 3 bartenders were behind the bar but only 1 was working. The tall bald guy and the fat guy with with long 80s metal hair were standing around looking stupid, talking to some girl at the end of the bar while paying customers stood around trying to get drinks.
