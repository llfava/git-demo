Now I love Bellinis, Grasshoppers and even the cliche Lemon Drop, oh my. The Oatmeal Cookie is off the hook! Rimmed w/brown sugar it's one on the top of my list. A close second is some Chocotini which they shave a Hersheys bar to garnish the top. This place actually makes these drinks taste as good as they try to make them look. Because of them 2 years ago, I can now appreciate \"bitch drinks\".  BUT you must get the right bartender, or they WILL taste like crap! Wish I could remember dudes name, all I know is he was there Mon-Thu nights.

You'll find the new and improved Lush a block up from it's old location, right in the thick of the Polk St. bar scene, with more room for your lushing and lounging pleasure.  The most important thing here is that they're back with same squad of bartenders because lets face it, good bartenders are what makes a good bar. You can have the fanciest, hippest location in the city and if your team sucks ass you won't last long.  It will take me awhile to get used to as I'm sure it will for many of us who remember the old, much smaller digs. I'm no old man though, I embrace change, and I have to say while completely different I'm very impressed with the new setup. Much more room, longer bar, more tables, more lushing.  Did I mention the fireplace? Cozy. I asked if I could bring my own materials for smores and while I didn't get an explicit \"no\" I could tell the idea wasn't really embraced, I may have to hold off.  Next time you're wandering Polk, check it out. New spot, new interior, new setup, same great staff and customers. I enjoy being a lush at Lush.",

This is the only bar I order mixed drinks at, typically I'm a bourbon on the rocks kind of girl- however like I mentioned earlier they are that dang good. They are also great at maintaining a non-riffraffyrowdy bar. The only negative thing is that since they are so damn good, I find myself here on a nearly daily basis. BTW their happy hour starts earlier than any other bar on the block- 3PM! Steve the owner is a amazing host and adds a personal touch and has amazing taste in bartenders. Svetlana (butchered your name- sorry) works on Monday and Friday Happy Hours, and Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings is skilled, quick, makes delish delish concoctions and is quick &amp;amp; witty. Jack is the latest addition to the Lush family and recently declared the favorite aside from Svetlana works Happy Hours on Saturday, Sunday and evenings on Friday and Monday.

Not too familiar with the area (except Tenderloin in general from traveling to San Francisco so much for my previous job), but it didn't feel shady at all. That could have been because of the hundreds of people milling about between bars and clubs on a Saturday at 12:30 am, but who knows.  Lush Lounge is small and gets crowded quickly, but the doormen were friendly. Two of the bartenders that served me were very courteous, prompt, and appreciative, but one of the bartenders - a tall, thin woman with long brown hair in a braid down her back - could have been a little more pleasant when I handed her my credit card and asked to open a tab. The Lush Lounge is *cash only,* and I didn't see the very small sign above the bar that read that, so I didn't know. She said they were cash only, pointed at the sign, and looked at me like there was something wrong with my face. I asked her if there was an ATM nearby, she pointed to the one by the door, and walked away. That, my dear girl, if you're reading this, is why you didn't get a tip, and the other two did.  Anyway, the review.  The Good: Great location; stiff drinks with loose pours; young, cool crowd. A good/bad combo: it's cash only, but apparently cash-only bars cost less. I bought the first round for my friends, which was three gin and tonics. I expected to pay upwards of $30, but it only cost me $18! There was good music playing, which wasn't too loud, but was loud enough you could still enjoy it if you were there for the music.  The Bad: I can't really write a bad review from one bad bartender, since she was probably having an off night and would normally be a fine conversationalist. The bathrooms are TINY, there's no stall (there's a toilet, it's just not in a stall, so if you have to relieve yourself it's going to be prison-style), and the line to get in was long.  The Bottom Line: I like this place, and I'm going back next weekend.",

The better the quality of the related piece of memory(association), the better the intelligence.  Let me explain further. When I first heard about Lush Lounge, I saw a picture of a lush, green forest in my mind's eye. Then I got reminded of \u00a0\"grrrl friendly\" parties like Lush and Pleasurezone and fond memories filled me with happiness. Hence, when I saw Jill's invitation to lounge at Lush post movie, I decided to trek couple of blocks from Franklin and land up at Lush.  Our experiences not only widen our capacity for forming mental associations, but also \"assimilates\" into our neural networks and deepen our intelligence. After my experiences at Lush on Friday, if I hear the word Lush Lounge, the picture of attractive women, drinking amazing fruit-based cocktails, competing for men's attention with the Divas across the street or the delicious taste of $ 3 frozen mango martinis tingling my taste buds or the smell of lingering pot or the touch of \u00a0 promising promiscuity towards the end stamps on my mind a rich multi sensory aroma of \u00a0 memories and I feel I have taken a strong small step in my journey of evolution and change.",

It was not a regular stop for me as it had two primary problems, the space was very small and the clientele was a bit FIDI and low brow.    \u00a0The new LUSH location has remedied both of these problems. First the location is just up the street but the size has been increased by 500%. I am quite taken with the new space. Beginning with the citadel strength doors that bar the entry portal to the two story open main room, a loft level located towards the back, a fireplace directly across from the bar. A perfect ambient level of light, dark but not so dark. The size of the room does a good job at mitigating the din.    \u00a0The clientele now is a lovely mix of local color. A comfortable and welcoming balance of every gender, orientation, creed and profession. I believe the Gulch has finally found the all encompassing social hall. I fear that it will be short lived as it will no doubt be invaded by the unsavory Marina sorts, hipsters and their ilk, so I advise to enjoy while it lasts.   \u00a0The cocktails remain superior, mandating fresh squeezed juices and the cocktails be hand made with craftsmanship. Considering the quality the prices are most reasonable. It pains me to write a review as I hate to put it on the map, but seeing that I no longer reside in the neighborhood and am infrequently in the hood( regrettably) I shall hope this recommendation will find its way to the eyes and ears of the sophisticated and happy socializers.

Somehow at this new location it's gone loud hetros on pussy/dick patrol. \u00a0One tranny in the entire bar, and I gave her a sympathy wink and smile. \u00a0A handful of aging queens, and the rest of the patrons were a bit too Marina for my taste.  But the cocktails still reign supreme. \u00a0And they are generous with the booze. \u00a0Shit wine (come on, step it up!) and some mediocre Australian faux champagne (come on, get something better!) \u00a0 A few of the bar tenders were attitudinal and I'm not impressed (she says longing for the old queens from the old location) \u00a0The guy at the door was cool, yakked with him a bit, he's the apex of diplomacy which is so vital for a job like that.  I wish the owner's presence &amp; vibe could have been felt more. \u00a0The art work in the very back, near the bathrooms is a sort of reminder of the old Lush Lounge \u00a0 . . . .",

    "review_text": "Polk Street has changed over the past few years and the not-so-secret word is \"lines.\"  Lines for bars, lines for drinks and, given the influx of a particular breed of clientele, probably lines of coke off dirty toilet seats.   But hey, I don't judge.  It's only when such lines come between me and my doing of things-that-I-like-to-do-for-fun-whatever-they-\u00admay-be do I feel a certain level of impatience. And when even local dive favorites like Hemlock start holding lines out the door, I grow a little disheartened.  Then there's Lush Lounge. With its tropical fans and pretty green plants, the bar's decor appropriately exemplifies its status to me as an oasis in Polk Street's new sea of oontz-oontz and drunken frat kids who can't let go of college. That's not to say Lush Lounge isn't packed with the occasional bro on peak nights. It is. But I never really have to wait to get inside and, once inside, I never really have to wait long to get a drink.  A bar is only as good as its staff, and, like my other local favorite bar, Koko Cocktails, Lush Lounge's expert drink crew are professional and friendly. Svetlana, in particular, is always wonderful to chat with. (Some of you may remember her as the friendly bartender from past Yelp Elite Events.) If you don't know what to order, I suggest you ask her. There is always a list of specials and she makes great recommendations.  So there you go. Decently priced drinks, a tolerable crowd and Svetlana. The faux-lush inside will thank you for it.",

Plus, they have really cool drinks. I had a blood orange cosmo and some lemon-raspberry concoction, both of which were delicious and only $7 each. You really can't beat that price.

Needless to say, it provided material for some interesting conversation. We didn't try any of the drinks but they did look good and they seemed reasonably priced. If you're a single guy, this would be a good place for you. We noticed the ratio of male to female was pretty unbalanced. They play decent music here too which is always a plus.

Lush is small, but cozy and comfy. The decorating is excellent - black and white photos adorn the walls, and a silent film plays on the screen at top. The music was pretty nice, too -a little retro but definitley refreshing amidst the ever popular \"club beatz\" down the street.   It was pretty dead inside. A few regular- types, and an old man that talked our ears off about his gambling addiction and close ties with Madonna, Jack Nicholson, etc. (I'm still wondering how much of that was BS). He was eventually what got us out of the place, but we probably would have stayed. The drinks were good. Not amazing, but good. We ordered some cosmos and then some sort of vodka/lemon shot. As the bartender explained, it literally was lemons soaking in vodka. Next time, I'd like to try some of their specialty drinks.   The best part about this place was its non-threatening atmosphere. The two waiters - Chris and Jake (yes we got their names!) \u00a0- were so friendly and sweet. After we went to this bar down the street and a chick fight broke out (broken beer bottles, blood), we came back to Lush for some end-of-night comfort after the chaos.

We happen to be here on a night that was very busy, which was unfortuante b/c this place might be cool on a random week night.   The selection of alcohol and beer was solid, my boyfriend was happy with all the bourbons they carried. However, the bartenders were horrible. My gin gimlet on the rocks was made different everytime I ordered it, and never was made correctly. Also, the prices were different every time we ordered, like the price was at the whim of whatever bartender we could flag down.   The place was way to noisy, the music was loud, and it was near impossible to carry on a conversation without screaming. I don't mid loud music, at a club where people are dancing, but not in a bar/lounge scene. No one was very friendly, and everyone was in a bad mood from constantly getting bumped.  There are just too many cool places in SF to go here again....",

Either way, I enjoyed this place so. CASH only but drinks are stiff. So, don't worry....you'll get your money's worth. Stand there a bit, then if you want to mingle with the crowd, you can.

    "review_text": "Lush and I go back a ways when my friend Carlos used to take me to the old, more compact location down the street to get the Lemon Drops. He liked chatting it up with one of the bartenders while we both got sloshed. I know from taking the 19 all the time that Lush moved up Polk to bigger digs with a fireplace and an upstairs area. It's like an episode of \"House Hunters\" where the bickering young couple is staying with her parents in her girlhood room as they shop for a house with four walk-in closets and twin sinks in the master suite. Well, Lush obviously found their true north with this far more relaxing industrial-cool spot (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1eQXwYo&amp;s=573244825131bd441cb44031756eab6b1c8ea74a6cbea7e65d71be0842ef6d7f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1eQXwYo</a>). I came with Jamie W. this time before doing our regular pastrami run at Miller's East Coast Deli.  It was a holiday weekend, so we figured the popular bars would be empty. Wanting to wet our whistles, I flashed back to the good times I had at the old Lush and was happy to discover the new place keeps the same convivial vibe. Oh wait, maybe I was the old lush, but I can be the new lush, too, right? It was Happy Hour, and we were already late since it starts at 3PM. The Lemon Drop wasn't on the list, but other temptations compensated. Jamie went for the tantalizing $6 Don Q Mojito evoking Havana nights he's never had (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1c2wmxL&amp;s=38511ff65550df3d67e86330a086eb94dd97d53370e7278117099a2cca47df49\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1c2wmxL</a>). I went predictable and ordered the $5 Blueberry Martini (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1bLfVvs&amp;s=1c09b8cc06cf502c481f2170724cd04da860de4f3f0450dd923e7c83ef9ed3f2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1bLfVvs</a>). Ah, their fruity martini cocktails are still addictively tasty. Yes, we had another round. And that pastrami sure tasted good after that.  COCKTAILS - 4 stars...they still make those refreshing martini drinks, don't they? AMBIANCE - 4 stars...far more spacious than the former spot with enough dim lighting that you don't notice the hipster quotient...much SERVICE - 4 stars...genuinely friendly and dexterous with a shaker (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1e6V4Nj&amp;s=95144fc42faed657c20699af419709aceebb3c6d07f4c3c2115843ac3b93bcd0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1e6V4Nj</a>) TOTAL - 4 stars...still holds up as a favorite watering hole with the $5-6 Happy Hour libations a major draw on quiet three-day weekends",

Sweet, not super alcoholic and comes in those cool glass jars  Agave Margarita: strong! lots of salt and fresh lime Mojito: delicious!

It's a great place to go to when you want to be out for a couple of drinks but you aren't in the mood for anything high profile or anything too divey. Its lively enough with a very interesting and diverse crowd but not too crowded and not too dead. Just right. I like that it has window views of the street to let the outside activity liven the place up - I hate it when some bars you walk into are all walls... I feel super claustrophobic.... Its a great place to just chat with a group of friends over drinks - a night-ender... also if you like old music like me, they play goodies from the 80s and 90s... Hello Journey and Boston and Hall and Oates....",

Same great bartenders. Although to be honest, there's one that I avoid because he puts too much mixer and seriously not enough alcohol into drinks. Sami and Svetlana are still there, and Sami is there for Friday happy hours. Besides the fact that he's a cutie, he makes some of the best drinks around! The new location doesn't have the red bathroom, the frozen martinis, the popcorn, or the golden mannequin (sp?), but they don't really lack anything. The atmosphere is great, the drinks are devine, and the staff is spectacular.  I've brought at least a dozen friends here, and they keep coming back and brining new people. It's one of those places you'll never forget, and will keep dreaming about those delicious, -- and when it comes to the Almond Joy martini that Sami makes-- orgasmic martinis, you'll keep coming back.",

I guess you can say I'm a regular (anyone who can walk into a bar and be told \"oh no here comes trouble\" while they hastily make a drink for you is a regular). The bartenders are fabulous in every sense of the word. Last \u00a0time I went there on a crappy date (we're talking a HORRIBLE date but I do digress) one of the bartenders conspired with me and he sweetly asked said date to leave. As soon as tacky boy left I got a sympathy drink on the house. Love it! Another great story involves my friend Kat. She and I were there getting our drink on one busy Saturday night when she had to use the bathroom. She went and came running back out. She called to Rami (the bartender on duty) and explained there was no TP. He stopped what he was doing to dash downstairs and bring her a fresh roll apologizing for the inconvience. How do you not love it when your bartender cares? The bloody Mary is tomato juice with the produce aisle attached to it. Anything out of their little \"black book\" of drinks is usually reasonably priced and tasty! It's a place with no pretenses; you can usually have a bar buddy within a few minutes of coming in (even if you came by yourself) and have at least one satisfying conversation. People watching here is great! The movies and music playing are usually stuff you like anyway (and fun to zone out to). All in all if you find yourself near Post and Polk do go.",

This place is kind of a throwback, a mish-mash of eras in one space and there is always 80s music playing. The cocktails are froofy and fun, so who cares if they are not super sophisticated? They always seem to have a drink special. Last time I was there there were Lemon Drops all night for $5. I like the Cactus Berry Margarita becasue they give you this big honkin fruit stick thing with it. Yum. The crowd is a mix, which I like, and is always pretty laid-back and friendly.

I was with two friends who hadn't been there before, and the woman in our group went a little ga-ga for Sami the bartender. He's middle-eastern and Italian and a lot of fun. Also fast and smart with a big smile and good vibes. We were feeling pretty fubu as I said above so we all had the watermelon frozen martini. Wowsa, what a tasty drink. \u00a0Thanks to the Lush Lounge and Sami. \u00a0It's a cool place for sure.  Note: I haven't been to the new Lush Lounge location up Polk Street, so I'm wondering what's happening there. I'm reading some of the more recent reviews. I'll let you all know when I visit there.",

The bar staff are excellent. By excellent, I mean they'll make you a good cocktail and won't ask you (me) to leave if you happen to slap one of the cute ones on the ass. Drinks are a little pricey and it can get a little crowded, but I'm still down.  Great spot for an impromptu party or after-work drinks. Fan. Like. Drink.",

Last night I took some friends visiting from England to the new location and I just knew it was going to be different. \u00a0Right off the bat through the door the vibe was different. \u00a0More Marina types than any other in the whole room. \u00a0Gay patrons yes, but the crazy mix of people I loved was gone. \u00a0Instead of the old black and white films playing on the flatscreen, they were instead playing \"Saw.\" \u00a0This is definitely not your father's Lush Lounge.  The drink I ordered, a Bellini, was in a smaller glass instead of the tall champagne glass of old. \u00a0Sigh. \u00a0It still, however, tasted wonderful. \u00a0  They say all good things must come to an end. \u00a0And sadly for all of us that miss the old Lush Lounge, this is very true.",

Fun rollicking guitar driven droning rock. Periodically, the band tries to sing. Dear Kinski, please don't rely on the vocals to carry any of your tunes. The charm of Kinski is not the front man. I know that statement makes me somewhat of an asshole, but what makes Kinski's music special is the strength of the music (Edge Set, Wives of Artie Shaw, The Party Which You Know Will Be Heavy, etc.) Really, take the lyrics out of Newport and there's absolutely NO degradation there. Alpine Static remains the standard bearer.  Lush seems to suffer the other extreme. The lynch pin here is the bartender(s). Lush has the ability to be a cool place to have a drink or two (or four). However, a poor bartender here (and I realize that \"poor\" is subjective in this biz) sucks all the joy out of stopping here, especially since this is a mixed club (homo/trans/hetero). I argue that the bartender at a joint like Lush serves as an even more important facilitator of the social glue. So Daveeed, where the hell are ya?",

The bad: the happy hour is a bit depressing and drinks are on the pricier side, as always (but not that pricey for the city)  The good: Around 8-9 pm, the music kicks up, the bartenders file in and Lush lounge becomes an awesome place to start or even spend the night. The best part about this place is the music- they blast some solid hip hop, 90's, and good time music (none of the hipstery house stuff) and it's a great place to meet up with friends, and enjoy a couple of good drinks. I was also impressed by how I shouted 5 drink orders to the gruff bartender who nodded and sped back with them drinks under a couple of minutes.  Ambiance: dimly lit, eccentrically decorated, awesomely music filled bar on Polk. A mix of college aged kids and mid 20's folks- on the younger side.

The inside is pretty roomy with an upstairs area I have not been in yet, but you can see it from downstairs. \u00a0There are a few little seating areas that are pretty cozy. \u00a0The bathroom situation is interesting, guys and girls have to wash their hands in the same area with 2 sinks, I couldn't decide if it was cool or annoying . . . but it's \u00a0. .interesting. \u00a0  I'd say the best thing about the bar is the drink selection. I definitely go there when I really don't want a lame old beer or boring drink, and I'm sick of wine. \u00a0Worth a try.",

Fav drinks: bloody marie, dirty vodka, mango &amp; watermelon frozen martini!! love it is like drinking an alcoholic slushy in a martin glass.. go for the double totally a great buy!! half the fun is watching them make your drink for you, true bar-tending...over all cant go wrong.   Has been a major stomping ground on my nights out in the city..over the past few years.. Totally love the gay decor and vibe, though have been noticing the straights are totally taking \u00a0over!! Totally enjoy the mix bar that this place was, but now the bouncer guy?? what has this place become. have to admit though i will hold a close place in my heart for the great times had laughing and drinking...an great people watching!!   I feel like i need to voice out a shoot for my fellow gays to make our presence better known.. Worried that we may be pushed out..Love this place to much!!  Glad to see business is huge, just concerned with the changing taking place... really do enjoy having the crazies walk in and shoot at us the paying consumers and the total drunks trying for one more drink... that trashy feel is what is all about the area!! \u00a0kinda like getting a show for free!! :)  All in all if you are still reading this, please go and enjoy your time here!! talk to others totally a kick back environment. just please go and be yourself it a great neighborhood spot!!",

Strong and tasty and ohhh it took me awhile to sober up once i left!!   I think what I like best is that it really is pretty loungey and mellow, it's a good place to have a few drinks and catch up with your friends without having to shout over a huge crowd or a bad jukebox!

Atmosphere and drinks are decent, nothing fancy, still kinda pricy (except happy hour) BUT the service at the bar and especially by the blowsy guy cleaning up the glasses from tables WAS BEYOND BAD, it was probably the worst \"service\" in the last 10 months in SF I experienced (and I go and eat out a lot). Why?  - The bar tending girl was at least only plain arrogant and unskilled.  - Yet, the blowsy cleaner took the biscuit. There was no pre-story or history to his behavior / no personal issues whatsoever. That is why I think the owner should know about the following behavior of him.  He pushed people (not only us 10) out of the way before cleaning the table and did not even excuse himself. It was so sad to see him being even extremely rude AFTER being clumsy. He touched and literally cussed people out and said that this behavior was normal in a public bar. He even told the security to remove the barrel table in front of us 10 people and made up poor excuses that they \"need\" the table outside of the bar where 2 other barrel tables were already uselessly standing around. No apologies, not even a try to talk things out. All that seemed normal for him and \"customer oriented\". Well, we didn't think so. And so did the other guests around us... So, this location has seen better days and luckily there SO MANY OTHER GOOD PLACES that value customers, are fun and deserve your hard earned money and tips.   I STRONGLY ADVICE YOU NOT TO COME HERE, you will be greatly disappointed. Cheers, George",

It is not this at all. \u00a0  Lush starts off the evening with a nice vibe, mature and comfy, with a casual ambiance to meet up with friends to imbibe a few and catch up with friends and their latest drama or gossip. It isn't crowded early, and the drinks are reasonable, like $8 call and $7 well.   The long single bar is to the left, there is a large picture window in front which is open on nice days to the street, with tables and chairs there and around the edges of the room. There is an upstairs mezzanine section for the overflow or private function crowd, but there isn't any table service that I could see. It is step up to the bar and order.   There are plenty of helpful bartenders, so the wait is never long. They offer a blackboard of specialty concoctions like most hip bars in SF do nowadays, but they aren't bogging down the bartenders with 5 minute prep time drinks with crushed fruits, shaken and never stirred girlie combos, mortar and pestle veggies, and a dab of bitters.   Lush Lounge is part of the Polk Street corridor of nightlife spots, where on weekends, particularly after 11 PM, the streets fill up with young revelers looking for a good party time. After 11pm here, the vibe changes from comfy and friendly to young hotties, single ready to mingle, and a line forms almost exactly at the strike of 11.   It isn't like the dance clubs in the TenderNob, since there is no dance floor here, and you can easily talk over the music, unlike most clubs, or even some bars like Rickhouse on Kearny. If you don't like the vibe (or change in vibe) here, you can just walk down the street to another spot on the Polk corridor.   Decades ago, Polk Street used to be famously Gay, before it was castrated by the Castro. You'll still see the occasional cross dresser and trannies in the lower Polk, which is an area that used to also have male prostitutes. But up here on the upper Polk area, it is Hetero, with the young Marina crowd migrating up as the evening wears on, and they tire of Buffy and Bif (or should I say Mitt?) named lawyers in the Marina spots.   During fleet week, there were groups of the Few, the Proud, the first in battle, roaming the bars in uniform, prowling for friend, not enemy. We applauded them and befriended them, thanking them for their service. I think they were looking for girls, but since the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, anything is game on Polk Street. I didn't ask, and they didn't tell.",

So I'm writing a text message on my phone and I look up and see a guy turned around at the bar staring at me. I ignore him and continue to message then I look up again and he's still staring at me!!! So I yell out, \"hey I ain't calling you\", at that point I expected him to get in my face, which usually happens at other bars, but he looked like a yuppie who was really scared at that point.

The old lush lounge was one of my favorite bars in the city: it was cozy, had great, unique decor and the drinks were amazing. Best of all, you never knew who would walk through the door next: some queers from the Tendernob, some sketchy characters from the TL, some trannies hopping over from Divas, or chill Russian Hill residents looking for a change of pace.  The new Lush Lounge is bigger, and the decor is nice, I'll give it that. but it's also completely faceless - no personality, nothing worth noting. Where once offbeat movies and weird pornos played on the screens, now you find sports games. The eccentric characters have been replaced by Marina clones and faux-hipsters. Even the drinks, which are now pricier, have lost their kick. My personal fave was the Cactus Berry Margarita -- now I wouldn't wish a sip upon my worst enemy.  Really sad, but all good things must come to an end. Enjoy your new digs, hetero girls and douchey boys - I understand that Blur, Vertigo, Hemlock, and the countless other places on the street weren't enough.

There do tend to be a lot of people here though, so finding standing or sitting room may get pretty tricky at times. I think the price of drinks here are pretty average too. One of the downsides is that their restrooms are single stalls, so there can be a line especially during those busy weekend nights. Overall, not a bad place to hang out, and wouldn't mind if I had to come back here.   A sad thing that did happen this night though is that one of my friends lost her phone, and when we called them the next day, no one picked up the calls after several tries.

The Yelp folks reserved the mezzanine for the evening's DYL and I'm really glad I decided to go despite my noncommittal \"sounds cool\" reply.  Decent selection of beer, excellent array of spirits and friendly bar staff. My drink of choice to start the evening was G&amp;T with Hendrick's Gin. Bartender #1 charged me $5 for my first drink. Bartender #2 charged me $8 for my second. When I complained about this bizarre price disparity, I was informed that all top-shelf drinks are eight bucks. Sorry if I ratted you out barkeep #1, thanks for the discount!  On tap I spotted Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale, Chimay and some kind of IPA. Definitely three choices I can work with!   I went outside for some fresh air at one point and a drag queen in a banana costume flirted with me. Gotta love Polk Street on Halloween!",

There's an upstairs which is sometime used for private events but when it's opened up it allows for a lot more room at Lush. The only bar is downstairs so you'll still have to go to up and down the stairs but long as you keep a sharp mind, the stairs will be no threat.  The bar is long so you probably won't have an issue getting to the front. There's usually only three or four bartenders serving the entire bar though so you'll be waiting awhile. They have a $20 minimum on credit cards and since drinks are pretty cheap you'll have to drink quite a bit to reach the minimum. Personally I think that's a blessing in disguise.   Lush is both a good place to start and end the night. There's no cover fee and it's a convenient place to meet up. It's purely a bar but there are dance clubs like Playland, Mayes, and Vertigo very close by. My recommendation? Stop by Lush first to get your drink fix and then head out to some dance clubs. End up at Lush again at the end of the night to share stories and keep drinking.",

They have an upstairs area that is just as crowded. I think there was a bouncer on the stairs so you probably can't go up once it gets too packed or something.   They check ids at the door and it might take a while to get a drink by no fault of the bartender. The crowd just gets really heavy by the bar area and you have to push your way through.",

    "review_text": "I love LUSH! I moved to the area just before Lush opened and figured McTeague's would be my local watering hole. \u00a0I was soooo wrong. \u00a0Lush is everything you could want and more. \u00a0  First and foremost, the drinks are delicious. \u00a0I had the lemon drop $5 happy hour drink. \u00a0Perfect mix of lemon sour and sugary sweet. \u00a0Next, I asked the bartender for a suggestion. \u00a0He made me a cucumber gimlet. \u00a0The most amazing delicious fabulous heavenly gimlet in the world. \u00a0It's actually my favorite drink. \u00a0But so many bartenders butcher it, I rarely order it. \u00a0The only place (prior to Lush) that I would even consider ordering one was at Le Colonial. \u00a0Well, now that's all I will ever drink again. \u00a0 All the drinks are handmade, shaken, stirred and scrumptious. \u00a0My friend had a Manhattan and she said it was excellent. \u00a0They use fresh fruit, real cucumbers, etc. \u00a0It's swanky without the snobby. \u00a0Oh, the happy hour specials vary. \u00a0One day it's blueberry martinis, the next lemon drops. \u00a0So, you can easily find a reason to go, you haven't tried the new happy hour drink yet!  Second, the bartenders. \u00a0Not only are they nice to look at, but they are also ridiculously approachable and friendly. \u00a0I didn't feel rushed to figure out what I wanted next and they happily recommended drinks based on my tastes. \u00a0They are great at what they do. \u00a0We actually went through three bartenders (no judgment, it was a rough week). \u00a0All three were equally nice and good at their job, making good solid strong drinks.  Third, the atmosphere/crowd. \u00a0My biggest issue with McTeague's are the pseudo wannabe ex-frat hipster folks. \u00a0I knew I was in trouble when a Britney song came on and the high pitched excited screams were not from a group of gay men. \u00a0Plus, really people, let the leggings and 'stache go. \u00a0It's sooo 2008. \u00a0Lush is the perfect mix and represents every reason I moved back to San Francisco. \u00a0You have hipsters, Irish dudes (cute ones too), lesbians, gays, straights, the random weird couple making out in the corner, and every other label I can't think of right now. \u00a0Everyone is friendly (except the weird couple, but eh, what can you do). \u00a0Each time I've gone, I've met people at the bar. \u00a0Just a good bar that draws a good group of people.  Fourth, the decor. \u00a0It's just light enough to see your friend or what's in your purse without holding it up to your face like your trying to eat something out of it. \u00a0But not so light to keep you from making a mistake by going home with someone that in the daylight, you might wonder what you were thinking. \u00a0The tables are set far apart and there's lot of options. \u00a0Tall tables, short small tables, tables for 6, a long table for 12 (or more), a nice long bar and a large upstairs for more private personal settings. \u00a0The jukebox plays good music and it's at a level where you can hear it, but you can also hear yourself think. \u00a0Plus, the have a FIREPLACE. \u00a0It's fabulous. \u00a0I warmed my hands and toosh and then headed out home. \u00a0  Fifth, the owner. \u00a0He's local (yay local small business owners) and I think I might have heard he also owns that great shop Leftovers (just down the street at Bush and Polk and then a large one on Sutter just down from Van Ness). \u00a0He was so nice and genuine, plus he said I have a great figure and his friends said I had porcelain skin. \u00a0Really, they had me at hello. \u00a0Compliments aside, he cares about this place and wants it to be successful. \u00a0It was refreshing to hear. \u00a0He's got my happy hour business for sure.  Overall, this is a great bar for happy hour, first stop of the night or somewhere towards the end of your night. \u00a0They have a jukebox with great music, everything from Morrissey to Snow Patrol to Lou Reed. \u00a0The drinks are very well made and don't take 20 minutes like other places (orbit, bourbon, I'm talking to you). \u00a0The crowd is eclectic and friendly. \u00a0The decor is fun and cozy. \u00a0The owner is nice. \u00a0Really, would even want anything else in a bar? \u00a0I think not.  Note: this place is cash only, but they have an atm machine in the bar. \u00a0The fee is $2 which isn't that bad since one of the convenient stores down the street charge like 3.25 or something ridic.",

I did notice more of a mix in clientele (read: more peeps in nicer digs), so I'm guessing the move from the seedier block has upgraded the place a bit.   I'm still a big fan of this place, although I missed the corner booth in the back of the old spot. The new bar, though, has a cool little wooden L-shaped booth near the front, as well as a circular table near the window that looks like a fat tree stump.  Hooray for Chimays!

But he said anytime I or anyone else wants it, just ask for the Cantalope Martini with Pear Vodka. So there you go. Let me know if you get it so that I can start charging for popularity rights. :)  Also, I'm sorta hesitant to admit this, but I haven't had a Long Island since graduation weekend in college. I know you know what I'm talking about. It's like once you graduate, your days of Long Islands, AMFs, and Jungle Juice are over (except if you're in Vegas).... (or in the Marina....) OK OK, simma down, I'm JK, not Marina bashing. You all know you love a night in the Marina every once in a while so don't get your panties in a double knot.  Lush made the Long Island make me happy. And deliciously so. You could poured that huge ole glass of smackingly good LI into a martini glass and served it at Gary Danko's.",

Past the gassblast, this was a fun joint. \u00a0We sat down at the bar and had a couple of cocktails, followed by their nightly special - some sort of strawberry cowboy koolaid served in a sugar-rimmed martini glass.

First of all, I didn't know that I wasn't aloud to do that. Second of all, NEVER touch a customer or YELL at a customer. She was the rudest bartender I've ever dealt with.

I kid, but the nice gentleman that served our liquor looked like the aforementioned actor, and I couldn't help but bring it up with him - though I'm sure this wasn't the first time nor will it be the last time he'll hear of it. 5 stars to him for being awesomely light about it.  The door to this joint is huge, resembling the entrance to an old church, but the decor inside channeled almost a speakeasy slash retro feel with their pictures posted up of Cary Grant and insanely attractive old Hollywood actors. There's a random bicycle nailed to the wall, and this awesome double fan circling above the bartender's area. I felt like I was in a speakeasy where it requires a password to get in. The ginormous barrels in the middle doubled as a makeshift table for three. The lovely part in all this is there's enough room to move around and not feel so claustrophobic.  How can someone not fall in love with this lounge?  Listed below are Lush lounge's happy hour times and drinks:   Sunday noon-2am Monday 3pm-2am Tuesday-Saturday 3pm-7pm  -$3 Bud Light draft beer, glass of wine (Chardonnay,Pinot Grigio, Merlot,Cabernet) -$4 glass of Champagne, Shot of Cuervo Silver Tradicional (100% Agave Tequila) -$5 Blueberry martini, Blackberry Bubbles **(I recommend ordering both of these)** -$6 Don Q Mojito, Margarita, Skyy Cucumber Ginger Gimlet  I've also tried their Dark and Stormy (which my friend described it looking as \"San Mateo beach water\" when mixed), Strawberry bourbon , sangria, and blood orange/raspberry infused vodka shots ($3 a shot!). I recommend all of these, b/c I don't torture myself with less-than-amazing tasting drinks that get you buzzed fast. Then again, I'm a 5'1 Asian woman, any alcohol will get me there.  A+++++ fast service, great drinks, will come back again! **CA$H ONLY*",

This is why I like Lush Lounge, and this is how they earned each star:   1) Interesting decor with a definite theme, but that does not overwhelm.  2) A strong gay contingent. I'm not of that tribe, but I like bars that are frequented by gay and straight alike. It tends to keep away the macho jerks with environment-killing transport/\"high-class\" hoochies in search of said jerks. It's very mixed in all senses--hipsters (which I might be mistaken for sometimes), people in definite dress-down mode, fashionistas, etc.  3) The Cable Car. I'm talking about the drink, folks. It was invented in San Francisco and is a little sweeter than drinks I usually go for but it's awesome.  4) Nice bartenders. Always friendly, always good pours.   5) There's good music but this is also a nice place to chat, sit at the window and people watch, whatever. It can get pretty crowded but the vibe always stays friendly and peaceful.  That's it, what more do you need?",

Located at the edge of the TL, LL provides a slight haven from the sketchiness that surrounds it. Small, dark, and extremely crowded, LL seems to be a happening spot filled with Marinaites and fresh out of college type kids. After reading yelp reviews, I had higher expectations for the drinks. Yes, the portions were enormous and decently priced, but quantity does not always equal quality. The selection was okay, pretty standard in my opinion but nothing very unique or exciting (not to mention the bartender was not particularly helpful or knowledgable about mixed drinks). I went for the most creative concoction on the menu, which turned out to be a ginormous margerita laced with cactus berry liqueur and garnished with blueberries, marachino cherries, and citrus wedges. The drink was served in a large rimmed sugar coated glass and was the object of everyone's attention for the first few minutes. As I struggled to make my way across the bar with my drink to catch my friends, about three girls stopped me and asked what kind of drink I had- apparently people were envious. Apparently no one was brave enough to venture out from their lemon drop bubble to sample something a bit more unique (seriously folks, how crazy is cactus flower syrup) as most people there seem to stick to the very basic cocktails. And the drink itself? Not bad, pretty sweet, pretty strong, but nothing to write home about with the exception that about a third of it made me pretty damn drunk and I had to give away the rest to my eager friends.",

Although it took him a long time to make, he didn't seem to mind and was very pleasant.` All of the happy hour drinks looked great especially the cucumber gimlet! I will definitely go back.",

If I was THAT trustworthy, I would have walked alway $42 short.  \"Long night\", he calims.   I'm sure.   Discraceful to see that such despicable people still exist.

I've experienced a few uncomfortable mishaps recently here. First one was about an apprentice bartender. \u00a0Every time when he took order that evening, he just couldn't find where the booze bottles were. Contrary to the customer's extreme patience, his excuse was like \"Oh, come on. This is my first day. Give me a break!\" \u00a0Ugh...ouch. I know he shouldn't have been there alone in the first place, but his attitude evidently lacks grace to work for my beloved classy martini bar. Second was about music. One day my folks and I went there for a couple of pre-dinner cocktails. As soon as we opened the gate, a loud noise struck our ears. This bartender was playing his kind of music all the time when he's on duty. I assume he thinks it's his privilege to play his favorites. I endure this ear-deafning music only when the bar becomes like a meat market on the late-night weekend, but not on weekdays especially after a long, long day. \u00a0Anyways, a bartender as a soothing ambiance creator should thoughtfully select tunes to allow us to relax, get a good buzz on and enjoy conversation. Then again, this bartender is one of the rookies. I hope those newcomers soon become able to carry on tradition of THE LUSH LOUNGE. Then, I'll be happy to give five stars.",

The decor is a little off kilter from the red and black signage outside to the wacky oval mirrors in the restrooms. Large cocktail menu with pretty much every martini you can think of. The bartenders are nice and once Happy Hour sadly ends you can still get a wonderful glass of Watermelon Sangria for only $4.50. Popcorn is provided at the bar...yummy salt.   **Note: if you're hunger grab one of the yellow Hanks menu, call in an order of tacos, wraps, sandwiches, fries, etc from across the street and you are more then welcome to munch while you cocktail.",

It didn't bother me at the time because I was with Mr. McDreamy, but it's not a place I'd go with my girlfriends if we were looking for some male admiration.",

Just throw me 4 dollars, they are usually 8.\"\n  To me, it seemed a bit petty for the bartender to have engaged in this whole exchange over a lousy drink. \u00a0A good bartender would simply have tossed it and made a new drink free of charge. \u00a0The moral of the story is always run your business in absolute good faith because you just never know what yelpers may be lurking in the corner....",

However, the drinks were good - I had a Bellini with what looked like fresh peach puree and the Champagne was ice cold as well. The decor was especially inviting - I plan on going back on a more normal San Francisco day.",

I was going to take him to Bourban and Branch, but he picked this place because he missed it.  We each got 2 shots of Knob Creek, the pourings were HUGE, it was more like 4 shots each. We sat down on the corner wood bench, kept our legs rested on the stool, I LOVED IT! The bench is designed differently, like a V shape so you could rest your butt there comfortably, without having to keep your back straight all the time.  2nd time I went there was a Monday afternoon after going to Brenda's for a late lunch. I have to say it is pretty strange going to a bar at 3pm on a Monday. This time I wanted something girly because I had rehearsals later, and found out that they actually have a very exciting cocktail menu!! I got the lychee pomegranate martini, delicious! But I couldn't taste lychee or martini...at all. Strangely enough, 3 hours later in my rehearsal I started burbing lychee, well, still delicious!",

Who I went with: A girlfriend who doesn't like clubs and writes for law journals and likes English literature  Drinks are really inexpensive here: From ($3) for beers and a few fruity specials to ($7) for a lot of the other specials.  The ambiance is quite eclectic. There's a smorgasbord of 40's and 50's memorabilia and two TVs that are playing classics like The Graduate and Breakfast at Tiffany's. The setting is dark with orange and red lighting, but with the 80's music playing, it gets very loud inside. There's no room to dance so this would be more of a place to sit around talking to a friend or two.   I've come here with a large group of young people and I was just glad that we had already had a few drinks before we had arrived. The seating isn't conducive to having a group outing here. The crowd is a bit older and you will see several regulars having a beer here. There are always far more men than women here.  The bartenders are always so nice here. One even made us popcorn just for fun and it was a really nice touch. The drinks are pretty strong here. The bathrooms are lit in bright red which always makes me feel uncomfortable because it really prevents you from seeing the true uncleanliness.

It was pretty laid back and quiet on a Tuesday night- I enjoyed the calm atmosphere, &amp; the tropical decor is sort of cool! Looks like they have an upstairs as well (wasn't open on my visit).   I didn't visit the bathrooms, but I swear it sounded like people were using a giant blow dryer back there to dry off?   I shall be back Lush to drown in a giant cup of Pimm's!",

I'm not sure if it's me or the menu, but I've struck out with Lush specialty cocktails. The key lime martini was super sweet and syrupy, not tart at all like I was hoping for. The blueberry martini was better but didn't really taste like blueberries... I should remember this each time I go in and order beer instead, but the martini menu is just so alluring. I bet I'll find a good one sooner or later... I do want to try to jalapeno-infused tequila.  The crowd seems to change a lot. I've seen everything from uber-drunken women in their 30s draping themselves all over men at the bar to bikers chillin' with buddies to \"normal\" peole just hanging out.  I like the vibe in there... reddish lighting, dark wood, and old-fashioned bar decorations. One of these old-fashioned decorations is a cigarette ad with a woman that looks a lot like my mom... even more so after a few drinks. Weird.  It's definitely an added plus that you can order dinner or snacks from Hank's across the street and eat them at the bar. They even make it easy by having menus all over the place. Try the blue cheese tater tots... yum. Now if Hank's would only deliver...  Long story short, Lush is not phenomenal, but it's a decent bar to have in the neighborhood.",

No wonder the city doesn't sleep, it's too busy trying to get laid\"   I went with my best friend and elite yelper Tiffany [exclamation point ] Van and we both agreed that we have never seen so many attractive men (that smiled back at us) in the same vicinity. And here I thought so much of anything in the immediate radius only applied to spiders.   Now on to the actual venue. The place has an upstairs complete with a banister that allows you to look down at the crowd and plot targets like a an electromyography exercise, in other words, you can spot the cute guy or girl and make your way down the stairs and move in for the kill. The place is modeled to resemble an old parlor and the crowd is about as electric as hipster district Valencia and won't fail to disappoint, whether you're trying to get laid or not lol.  Expect it to be crowded and expect problems trying to move through the crowd as blaring music will muffle any propriety such as \"excuse me\" or even in worst case scenario, they hear you and refuse to move anyway.  The drinks are reasonably priced, and by reasonably I mean reasonable for a place that doesn't list the prices at all on the overhanging menu.  The bartenders have a variable knowledge of pour mans friends and also showcased strong shots for $3 in lemonade dispensers. I'd stay away from those though because they tasted like licorice and gasoline.  One thing you may not know of is the ginger beer which tasted amazing! A strong and refreshing ginger taste, alcohol completely undetectable yet strong enough for a great buzz.",

Even though I like both of those fruits, I trusted his opinion and went with the Cantaloupe Cosmo, wow. Mmmhm, a winner in my book (or in my mouth, depending on how you want to look at it).  It's also super chill on weeknights- good for conversation and quick service. The only annoyance is the complaint I tend to have about the mirror being between the girls and boys bathrooms...don't people realize it's kind of awkward to look at yourself in the mirror while guys are coming in and out? Haha, last night one guy gave me a sheepish smile while I was attempting to fix my hair...yea mirrors in actual bathrooms are much cooler.",

The inside of the bar is kind of rustic with barrels as tables and game plants having from the ceiling.   We went during happy hour, so drinks were very reasonable. We got a gimlet, which was smooth and sweet; a dark and stormy, my favorite; and a sweet tea, which was served in a mason jar. Oh, and of course the $3 bud light. After happy hour, it gets more expensive, so I would probably only come before 7pm.  The bar wasn't crowded when we went, so we had no problem finding a barrel to talk around. The upstairs section was closed for some reason. Good play on their part, because now I will atleast go again just to sit upstairs. Like everyone else said, the music was good and not too loud.",

Bartendars were quick and poured great drinks. The space is decent with like a wood theme which was cool. The cool thing is if you can snag a table by the window on a nice day you can sit with the windows open.  So good drinks + good happy hour+ many other bars in the area to hop around to = a great time.

This is sad for a lot of reasons, especially given its new, west-side of Polk orientation which protects it from the sun which used to turn the old place into a sauna.  I have nothing negative to say about this place, it's just that it doesn't carry forward the magical, mystical place I used to love across the street. \u00a0Oh well.

The flow of the crowd moves both in and out, the art work is rustic and old, and the bathroom design is smart and functional. If you need to wash your hands, you don't need to stand in line and hold up the line-it feels Ally McBealish.  I'm a fan of their lounge feel and the coziness of the seating. My friends and I frequent this place early in the night when we can and I've just become a fan of their sangria. They're one of the few bars that carries a wide array of vodkas beyond the usual Chopin, Belvedere, and Grey Goose. (But no Jennifer, they do not carry Hangar One vodka.)  Come early to stake out a cozy corner seat and I can guarantee you'll not feel the need to do any bar hopping of any sort. The drinks are made well, the noise level is really kept to a minimum because of the high vaulted ceilings, and your empty glasses are frequently taken care of by the floating busser.

Maybe more but I couldn't tell with all the people crammed together. This meant that in order to have access to the bar you would have to maneuver your way around the divider.

A few weeks ago I actually looked inside and saw a good mix of people including a fair amount of scantily clad BeBe dressed Marina bitches and popped collared Jaegar bombing douche bags - so I thought, this place can't be that sketchy if these ex-sorority and fraternity gods took it upon themselves to travel down from Mount Olympus and mingle with us normalings.  Checked it out last weekend during the afternoon. What a nice place. \u00a0Wonderfully decorated. Nice chill music. Huge windows and window seating, perfect for people watching while sipping your $6 Sweet Home Alabama Tea deliciousness.  Last night I went back again. My friends were having a joint birthday party.

Personally I find an enjoyment of interacting with bums after a bunch of drinks, but one time some crazy tried to rob me and my friends...with some nail scissors. Too bad he didn't realize there was a cop standing 5 ft. away, who batted the scissors out of his hand and frisked him and told him to get lost.   But the corner of Post &amp; Polk offers a variety of interesting characters, namely the trannies. Last time i was at the Lush I witnessed a great fight between the bartender and a tranny, who claimed that she was ripped off by the bartender. Not so much a fight as he just did his best to take the punches while pushing her out and locking her out until the cops got there. But hey, its the Tenderloin!

I guess you are getting your wish, Lush--maybe if you continue to treat *shock* *gasp* straight, cute women like dirt and make a point of ignoring them while they wait to be served at your empty bar, they will stop coming. \u00a0I know I will.   Even nicer was how the bartender looked at me with my money out, ignored me and went to talk to his friends at the end of the bar. \u00a0I also love how the 2nd bartender or barback, saw me, then proceeded to vaccum the floor behind me for 5 minutes, then ask two guys next to me if they wanted anything else. \u00a0  When I was a bartender, I only ignored patrons that stiffed me or were rude and obnoxious. \u00a0As I had just arrived and did not do either of these things, I can only think of it as discrimination. \u00a0Nice bar, you jerks. __________________________________________________\u00ad__ Friendly bar staff. \u00a0One bartender always remembers me and that is cool after only being there what 3 times? \u00a0Yummy, cheap frozen martinis (made with grain or Velikoff I'm sure) that give you a quick buzz. \u00a0Good mojitos, love the yummy Mango margaritas. \u00a0Popcorn and movies during happy hour.

We passed it the first time, assuming it wouldn't be so great judging from the dark, run-down feel of the outside. However, we noticed there was a constant flow of people wanting to go in, so we decided to give it a try. I think it was a bit early in the evening -- around 10? -- so there was ample seating upstairs. We scored the corner booth seat and grabbed a couple beers (mediocre variety to choose from) from downstairs. The music isn't so loud that we would have to yell to be able to hear each other yet just loud enough to give it the divey feel to mark it a good night. As the night progressed and each time we went downstairs to get more drinks from the bar, it was getting increasingly more (very much more) crowded. We ended up having a lot more fun than we had expected and will definitely be trying Lush again in the future.",

Basically, Sunday-Wednesday would be the night to go for me. ------ My friends and I found this bar while on a Tenderloin Pub Crawl. A year later and we have become regulars. Maybe it's because my best friend and her sister live right across the street or maybe it's because the bartenders are hot and nice and well--when the bartenders think you are cool, all in the world is right for a drunkard, if ya know what I mean.  There are tons of girly drinks, including two slurpie machines that are contantly churning cheap chilled boozie goodness. I've done more shots here than I can count though so you aren't relegated to the foo foo stuff. I usually just trust the bartenders to get me drunk off whatever they want to pour and I've never been let down.   Go here. Say hi to David.

There is a private area upstairs which was nice for people watching and to escape the crowd.  The drinks are fairly priced and there were many good specials. The bar is cash only which is a bummer, but luckily I knew beforehand so I came prepared. The men and ladies' restrooms share a common sink area which made it even more crowded because the sinks had twice as many people using it.  The environment was very casual and relaxed.

And they're like, \"Ok...with the garnish, that's 8 bucks.\" And you think, \"Why don't I garnish your face asswipe?\"  Well, my friend talks and talks and talks about this place and the magical garnish. So, I'm like \"What...they give you two limes?\" The first time I go, I got nothing. Nada. No garnish. Come to find out that this particular bartender isn't a big garnisher.  Second time I go, I order a cactus margarita. Well, hot damn and hallelujah. They garnished the fuck outta this thing. Seriously, they used blueberris, raspberries, pieces of orange, strawberries, and I believe a few blackberries, and the guy made a bridge around my drink with these fruits and some toothpicks. A frickin bridge! I mean, we were joking that I was disappointed in the garnish last time. Perhaps he went crazy on me? But seriously, I was like...\"Wow.\" We sat near the window staring at it, afraid to drink the Sistine Chapel of alcoholic beverages. It was...truly magical.  Now, I paid for the damn thing so I did drink that. Don't think I'm wasting perfectly good liquor cause it's \"pretty.\" The drink was rather tasty, and I had three woman ask me what it was so they could order one themselves.  Awesome place. A little small, but in that neighborhood, I'd call it cozy. :)",

The lemondrop is always perfect, and the chocolate martini is like dessert with a buzz. There's drink specials on martinis each night... yay for me! Cuz I hate beer.\n  I love this place for being the polar opposite of a dump like Zeitgeist: no tragically annoying hipsters with bedhead and Chuck Taylors, no stinky port-o-lets, no cig smokers, no questionable BBQ, no bearded bikers. The bar has a casual, mellow atmosphere and its perfect for hanging out. It's not a meat market, and the indoor bathroom is clean. \u00a0You can sit by the window and watch the parade of humanity cruise on by, placing bets as to whether that dude from South Bay realizes he just picked up a tranny hooker instead of a genetic female. This beats reality tv any day. \n  Lush Lounge is one of the few spots on that stretch of Polk Gulch that is not full of about-to-barf drunken 20-somethings. I hate dives, in case you haven't noticed. A year in NYC in the company of gay men cured me of any tolerance of places where they'd sooner spit in my glass than make me a martini. I am in my 30s and do not consider a fun night out to be one where I sit on a wooden bench and swig PSR during inclement weather. I appreciate a place where I can have a good drink, hear my friend talk to me without shouting, and can safely stagger the 2 blocks home at closing time. \u00a0Plus, the bartenders are cute and friendly.",
