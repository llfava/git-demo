We'd come back again and try their other food on their menu soon.",

This little wine bar is so tiny but packs a lot of charm and character. From the dead deer head thingy on the wall, to the corks on the mantle, to the cute little delicate menus to their amazing selection of beers and draft wine, I may have found my new favorite wine bar.  I had their pinot noir on draft ($10/glass, $20/half bottle) and it was so delicious. Fruity and light just the way I am. Or the way I like it.  Their cheeses are really good and I really wanted to try their famous mac and cheese but that will just give me an excuse to come back and try possibly everything on their menu.  We got there yesterday night at 8:30 and the place was packed. We were lucky to find 2 seats at the bar. Definitely go early and if no seats are available, they have heat lamps outside for you to wait while tables open up.  Definitely one of my new favorite bars in the city. I love you!",

We had great experiences eating and drinking at Fat Angel and will definitely be returning often. Their space is curated perfectly, and even in the small space, they do have adequate seating. The staff is very friendly and they do a good job managing the bar/register/wait list. They have a great mix of indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a waiting area for people who haven't been seated yet.   Their beer list is rare and extensive. Pages and pages of beer that is rare/hard to find, all at relatively good prices. They have an eclectic mix of beer and wine, and there's always something new and interesting to try on their draft board.   Their food is spectacular. We've tried the pretzel, a bunch of their cheeses and meats, the baby kale salad, the mushroom flatbread, and the mac 'n' cheese. Their portions and large and everything tastes great. Their pretzel is one of my favorites in the city, and their kale salad rivals Darwin's, which is quite a feat. The only \"meh\" dish is the mac 'n' cheese; the sauce is kinda watery and the pasta could be more al dente.   Fat Angel is a great date night spot, or just a place to grab a special beer. We love it here!",

Fried Capers w/ Sage: I thought fried pickles were cool, but they don't hold a spear to fried capers! \u00a0Seemed like caper flavored air-filled raisins. \u00a0Each wrinkly skin of caper shatters in your mouth leaving just a wisp of bitter caper taste and a lot of salt. \u00a0Great on the innovation front, but felt a little grease overload halfway through. \u00a0Best to share.  Maple Bacon Butter: Why did it take so long for someone to offer this? \u00a0Two of my favorite things together at once. \u00a0Real bits of fresh crisp bacon in a mound of extra buttery butter. \u00a0The bread offered was nice, but mainly just a vehicle for me to enjoy this butter because spooning it directly into my mouth would be a huge social faux pas.  Wild Mushroom &amp; Truffle Oil w/ Pecorino Flat Bread: The bread was extremely thin, like a cracker. \u00a0Kind of reminded me of a makeshift pizza I once made from leftover whole wheat lavash bread. \u00a0The truffle oil wasn't heavily pronounced, they need to use more. \u00a0Overall, not so much a fan.  Mac-daddy Mac n' Cheese w/ Bacon: Dense spirals that manage to stick some gooeyness between each ramp. \u00a0The dense chewy texture was a nice change of pace compared to the limper elbows often offered. \u00a0The bacon was a nice add-in as always, but could have been crispier.  Blueberry Tart: Not on the menu, but a substitute for the dessert they ran out of. \u00a0It was more like a mini blueberry cobbler than a tart. \u00a0Loved how the freshly whipped cream melted ever so subtly over it's luke warm dough. \u00a0Had that great jam-like blueberry texture which feels richer than the flowing berries of a traditional blueberry pie.",

When we showed up at about 7:45pm on a Friday night, the place was PACKED. \u00a0Every seat in the house (even outside, where it was cold) was taken, and we put our name on the wait list. \u00a0We each ordered a glass of wine, and were seated before we finished them. \u00a0The staff seemed slightly overwhelmed by the number of people, but they did a good job of handled the chaos, were knowledgeable about the menu when we had questions, and overall we had a very pleasant dining experience.  My wine, a Syrah/Cab blend from N2, was delicious and complimented the food perfectly. \u00a0They also have a very unique and diverse beer selection, and I greatly enjoyed reading the humorous and informative descriptions on the menu.  Food we ordered for 2 people, and left stuffed: - Smoked Trout Salad with Horseradish Vinaigrette: Could have used a few more pieces of trout, but was seriously good. \u00a0After devouring the salad, we had high hopes for the rest of the meal, and were not disappointed.  - Flatbread with Gorgonzola, Grapes, Walnuts and Prosciutto: Super thing and crispy bread was just thick enough to support the deliciousness on top. \u00a0The combination of flavors was amazing.  - Charcueterie of Duck Salami, Wild Boar Salami, and Sopressata (see picture): Served with warm thinly sliced bread and whole grain mustard, the meats were amazing. \u00a0We both agreed that the duck was the winner, but all were really good, and I thought about sneaking the mustard home with me, it was that good. \u00a0  We were too full to order dessert, but plan to come back soon and save room to try either the bread pudding or blueberry cobbler. \u00a0I only wish this restaurant were closer to home, as it was amazing. \u00a0In fact, it might very well be my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco, and those of you who know me know that I do not give that title out to just anyone. \u00a0:-)  Happy 1-year Anniversary, Fat Angel. \u00a0I wish I'd known about you sooner, but I will certainly be back for more!",

She was not friendly at all, when we asked her for some opinions on beer since it was our first time here, she seemed a little annoyed but nothing too obvious. Although, her true colors came out later. I understand that it was a Friday evening and it was quite busy in there, but like I said, this place was small!!! When I was literally waving to her for her attention, she just kept not looking our way at all and we took up like 1/5 of the place!

Thank you for serving brunch on Saturdays now because I always end up at Farmer's Market at noon:thirty not having had much more than water since waking up. So I buy all this food, but I am too hungry to walk 3 blocks home to cook it. And there's Fat Angel heralding to all with his trumpet that breakfast is served beckoning with door and windows flung open.  A few weeks ago I had the traditional Ploughman's lunch - meat, cheese, bread, pickles, mustard, fruit, and a beer. All I have to say is that what ye ask for, the universe shall provide. Last week, I had coffee dripped straight from heaven trickled through a Sightglass (sorry Blue Bottle - I still love you) alongside an egg baked over brisket. It's nice to chat with the bartendress at this time, too.  And you get to be serenaded by the strings of the live jazz band that usually plays during the market. All they need to do is add a harpist.   I've also now had the desserts and just about everything on the food menu except for Cy's salty sweet Chinese nuts. Nope, I've never had dose nutz.  Which brings me to one of my favorite quotes about our fair city:  Most people believe the afterlife is one of eternal bliss.

They'll take your phone number and text you when it's ready so you don't have to physically be there.   We ended up getting seated at the bar, which was fine. But it took about 20 min until someone acknowledged us (only about 3 ladies were working). We were able to sample some of the wines before we decided on what glass to take. The server was super friendly and knowledgable. I noticed it's the same price to drink wines by the glass versus buying a bottle, so it allows you to try multiple kinds! And the pours are generous!   For food we ordered the wild mushroom flatbread with truffle oil and a salad and added rotisserie chicken for $3.   The endive salad was a hefty portion! I do wish there was a bit more chicken throughout, but it was tender and flavorful. I enjoyed that it wasn't overly done, but bf found it to be too sweet for his tastes.   The flatbread was delicious as well! Almost a cracker crust with bits of pecorino cheese.   Prices are a tad bit high for what you get, but I think you're paying more for the location and vibe.",

Fat Angel did not disappoint!  When we arrived there was about a 1/2 hour wait for a table and the bar was completely full with people who were eating. \u00a0The bar area itself was very small and a little crowded as there were two other couples waiting for tables who had arrived before us. \u00a0Despite it being a little crowded, the bartenders were very attentive to us while we were waiting and constantly made sure our water and beer glasses were full. \u00a0  As were were waiting we good in the atmosphere- the chandelier hanging from the ceiling, the beautiful wooden bar back, and the dimly lit room with candles set a nice atmosphere. \u00a0We got some great beers on draft while we were waiting, some type of double IPA for each of us. They had a good amount of beers on tap and also an extensive paper menu of bottled beers. \u00a0For food, we started off with the cheese plate. Fat Angel had a list of cheeses we could selected from. \u00a0We had the Bella Dry Jack (based on Yelp reviewer advise), Spanish semi-soft cheese, and a Spanish soft cheese. \u00a0The platter was set up nicely and did not disappoint.  For the the meal I ordered the Mac &amp; Cheese- and it was amazing!!! I am a big mac &amp; cheese fan and regularly order it - and this is one of the best I have had! \u00a0I loved the flavor and the consistency of the pasta. \u00a0It had just the right amount of cheese to not be too cheesy. \u00a0My husband ordered the flat bread with the roasted red grapes, walnuts, and proscuitto. \u00a0I tried a piece of his pizza and it was very flavorful. \u00a0  Overall the service while we were at Fat Angel was great. \u00a0The service was outstanding and we felt comfortable throughout our meal. The waiter checked on us to make sure we had enough beer, water and everything we needed. \u00a0We enjoyed the food, good beers, and if back in San Francisco we would visit again for sure!",

After parking nearby with my friend P, we made a beeline here to quench our thirst and grab a bite. Unfortunately, there was a small crowd of people jamming the doorway and we thought we might be out of luck. After all, the place is really tiny.   Undaunted, we squeezed through to the bar to find several open spaces. I guess everyone really wanted a table. \u00a0We didn't.  The draft beer list here (written on chalkboard) was FANTASTIC: all microbrews, including two IPAs, a golden ale, a porter, a weiss beer, a brown ale. a double IPA and even a sour beer. \u00a0The bottle list was much longer; The waiter said the total count was over 100! \u00a0So many choices that we couldn't decide, and so we left. (yeah right)  The menu was short but we found what we wanted quickly: sliders for me, and chicken pot pie for my buddy P. \u00a0Unfortunately, it took about 15 mins to get someone to take our orders. (Staff was very thin.) At least we had tasty beers in front of us and some time to examine the cool decor, including the large glass chandelier (echoes of the nearby Fillmore?) and the back of the bar, which appeared to be made out of an old church organ...pretty Cool actually.  Once we ordered, the food arrived quickly. We both enjoyed our meals and our second, tasty brew. \u00a0The night was off to a good start. \u00a0By the time we paid up and left, the outside crowd had doubled, and even bar seats were in demand. We were glad we had arrived when we did.  5 stars for the perfect pre-show dinner and excellent beer selection; 1 star off for the spotty service.",

    "review_text": "After seeing great reviews on Yelp my boyfriend and I decided to try out Fat Angel last Saturday. We arrived at the restaurant around 7:30 and we're told there was one party in front of us as we put our name on the list. Note, we didn't actually write our name down or watch a host write our name down, we just gave our name to a waiter who was supposed to be responsible for the wait list. I never actually saw our name or any other guests name recorded in any way. Anyway, after putting our names on the \"list\" we grabbed a drink and stood near the entryway with a couple of beers. A few minutes later a couple came in and put their name on the list. Two seats opened up at the seat yourself bar so we sat down. Food menus were placed in front of us immediately, I told the waiter I would rather wait for an actual table, which he said was fine. A few minutes later I see the couple that came in after us being seated. I grabbed the waitress working that night and told her that we had come in first and asked why we weren't being seated. First the waitress tried to argue with me and insist that I must have just imagined to have stood next to them while they put their name on the list and that they probably came in earlier. When I insisted that no, we came in first, we were there when they put their names on the list the waitress rolled her eyes and told us that most people were fine sitting at the bar so the waiter handling the list had probably just taken us off. She then just walked away. I was shocked. She was just so rude. Instead of trying to rectify their mistake she acted like it was so ridiculous to expect the wait / host staff to do their job. I didn't catch her name, but the waitress working 5/19/2012 was probably the rudest waitstaff I have dealt with. I couldn't believe she just walked away, so I grabbed another waiter to try and get the situation resolved. The second waiter (named Sai I believe) apologized and offered to buy us a round of drinks out of his own pocket. Now, in retrospect he probably wouldn't have paid for the drinks out of his pocket the restaurant probably would (or at least should) have an allowance of food and / or drinks that can be comped when there is some sort of mistake on the part of the staff, but since he was saying it would be coming out of his pocket and since he was neither the very rude waitress I had just dealt with or the incompetent waiter who \"put our names on the list\" I refused the free drinks and just asked that we be seated at a table as soon as possible. A while later we were seated at this little window - bar thing. I thought it \u00a0was odd we were being seated there since we refused seating at the bar and this was ostensibly the same or worse than seating at the bar, but at this point I was quite hungry so I just sat down. We ordered cheeses, meat, a salad, the mac &amp; cheese, and a couple glasses of wine. The cheeses, meat, and wine were delivered quickly and were fine. The salad came out after we were finished with the cheeses and meat. The food was fine, not mind-blowing, but not bad. We were about two-thirds of the way through the salad when the check arrived. Both of us were sufficiently satiated so we didn't ask about the mac &amp; cheese, but it was at this point that I decided I had to write a review addressing the subpar service at Fat Angel. The waiter who had offered to buy us a round came with a check that had taken the first round off the bill, which was nice but didn't really make up for all the issues with the meal. To me it seems like most of the waitstaff would fit better at a crappy dive bar, where you don't need to write things down because it really is much easier to remember a few drink orders than the names and order of people on a wait list or several tables food orders and you can be more surly with guests.  In short although the beer and wine list seems extensive &amp; interesting the service will keep me away.",

    "review_text": "WOWZERS! What an amazing find (yelp comes through again) for pre-Fillmore drinks &amp; eats! And what a serious bargain for city dining!   Everything was in our favor last Thursday evening.. one of those odd nights where hubster and I must have had karma and/or the gods on our side.. rock star parking on Geary directly in front of the Fillmore? Check. The last available (corner) table for two at FA when we walked in? Check. Being seated, ordering, &amp; eating within about 40 minutes and getting to the show just as the lights came down? Check!  Contrary to reviews, service was FAST. And our waiter was super friendly and sincere. Instead of trying to upsell us, he discouraged us from each ordering a salad as they are GIGANTIC and also said if we weren't super hungry, we could probably share the mac n' cheese vs. each getting our own. We opted to each get our own anyway as we weren't ordering any other apps., but he was totally right, we ended up both leaving with a to-go box of mac (which then became our next day lunches!). \u00a0  As far as the food goes, everything was ridiculously tasty. The horseradish dressing on our arugula salad was super yummy, but the fried capers put it over the top! And the mac n' cheese was some serious comfort food- perfectly cheesy with an amazing bread crumb toasty top, baked in its own mini casserole dish.. yum. We had to use some crazy will power to stop ourselves from leaving in a carb coma.  Finally, the beer and wine is I think what people first &amp; foremost come for; as they should. They have a terrific list not to mention some incredible and reasonable stuff on tap. Once again, our waiter actually suggested to me one of the least expensive wines on the menu, the $6 sauvignon blanc on tap (!) and had we had more time, I would have \u00a0loved to have shared a bottle. Super juicy and refreshing, easily one of the best wine deals in town.   As a side note, to be honest, the name Fat Angel was a bit of a turn-off. I thought it sounded a little cheesy, especially after ogling the gold chubby angel that greeted us, hanging prominently above the doorway. BUT, don't be fooled, inside the decor is actually quite nice. I especially dug the gaudy in a good way giant crystal chandeliers and what appeared to be extremely large golden organ pipes behind the bar. The soundtrack was a decent mix of indie rock that was just loud enough to help mask the super loud and slightly rowdy conversations going on around our table.   All in all, Fat Angel is definitely thee place to hang before a show at the Fillmore and if you happen to live nearby, this is sure to become a new favorite. You could easily split one of their $9 giant salads (which are presented at your table in a large wooden salad bowl) four ways with a group of friends. $2 for a quality salad? You heard right.  Yummy beers, wines, eats and treats too, we were especially tempted by the bread pudding a la mode we saw being brought to a couple next to us.. next time I'm hitting that up for sure!",

We sat at the bar and sipped on our beers for an hour or so, enjoying the company, admiring the tree, slowly fading into the end of our night after a long work week. \u00a0  Just thinking about it now with the rain outside makes me want to zip over for some chic comfort food and a glass of something swanky. \u00a0I like that their beer and wine selections are atypical, adding to their sophistication I suppose. \u00a0  Friendly bartender, calming atmosphere, lovely space. \u00a0I'll be back. \u00a0Especially when it's cold out or I'm winding down for the night, but not quite ready for bed.",

I've had quite a bit off their menu--the highlights are the different butters and the salads, which are seriously gigantic. I ordered the chicken pot pie the last time I was there. The portion was pleasing, and I initially was really enjoying it, but the more I ate, the more I felt like it tasted like the pot pies I used to make in the ovens. So, there's your docked star--the pot pie isn't the best thing on the menu.   Great bar though, and bartenders are super knowledgable. Also I love wine on tap.",

    "review_text": "What separates Fat Angel from other wine bars in the city is the unconditionally friendly service from the owners and their thorough descriptions of the wines. They emphasize wines that are not from the CA region (which makes me happy, since I am a wino for Spanish and South American varieties) and they are willing to spend a lot of time talking about the flavors and your personal preferences. They also offer tastings if they think they have a great suggestion for you. It is San Francisco, so the prices reflect that (7-14 dollars per glass) but their 7 dollar glass is of a higher quality, in my opinion, than at most other wine bars. Fortunately, they do not have the all-too-common SF wine snob approach. They have been very good to me every time I come in, and this very quickly became a favorite spot. \u00a0 Lastly, as someone who avoids places like the Marina and the Financial District at all costs, it needs to be said that I've been in this place on the days when I've been sloppy and scrambling for loose change and on the days when I just bought a pretty new dress and wanted to make an afternoon of it.",

I was in the mood for a good beer, I ordered a La Moneuse Saison on draft for my first. It was excellent, love good Belgian beers.  I ordered the House Marinated Olives which are Castelvetrano Olives, \u00a0my all-time favorite!! They are large, light green olives that are hearty and light. A must if you are a sucker for olives.  Next up, we shared the Cheese Platter. This is an easy appetizer for groups. Pick the 5 Cheese platter - it comes with jams and accents to mix and match on your toasted bread. Yummm...   I ordered another beer for the dinner portion of our meal and went with the Christoffel Blond. A nice refreshing German Pilsner.   For dinner, my friend and I split the wild mushroom &amp; white truffle oil w/ pecorino flat bread and the Endive, apple, candied walnuts, gorgonzola w/ cider vinaigrette salad.  I highly recommend Fat Angel for the beer enthusiast.

My roommate and I were just waiting for the right time to make our visit. We live in the area and were lucky to come in around 10 and get seated immediately at one of the tables in the corner. Contrary to some of the reviews here, I found everyone who worked there to be really laid back and friendly. One of the servers even stopped everyone during dinner to announce that two veterans of the establishment were recently engaged. The place is small enough that it's intimate but without seeming exclusive, which is probably why it manufactures so many regulars.  And of course, the drinks. Definitely the most extensive collection of craft beers I've ever seen: the menu had about 8 pages of beer and wine, one page of food, and then another page of wine. I wanted to try a beer from the Bruery but wasn't willing to splurge quite yet and opted instead for one from Pretty Things. I also tried a cheese plate and the smoked trout salad based on the reviews here and wasn't disappointed.   Despite the quantity and deliciousness of the food, this is still a bar at heart, so it makes for an interesting inversion of your typical dinner. Simply by the way the menu is set up, you find yourself ordering drinks with a side of food, and butter with a side of bread. Next time I'm trying the chicken pot pie or the flatbread--just need to wait a while so I don't seem too eager.",

Also a great place to grab a glass of wine or two pre- or post- concerts at The Fillmore or Yoshi's.   Their wine list is rather diverse with hilarious little descriptions of the wine written by Jason, which actually is what drew me to certain wines over others. I mean how can you not want to try a Syrah that is \"Proof that God loves us. This wine will take you on a magic carpet ride to Pleasure Town. Worth every penny. Funky, freaky, delicious.\" Right? The \"Cosmic\" Syrah will take you on a trip, and the Tempranillo is magical. For Spring-in-a-glass, make sure you get the Grenache Blanc, and the Chenin Blanc is lovely.  There are also bar bites, cured meats, cheeses, salads, dessert and BUTTER. Get the maple bacon butter - you'll wish you had a jar of it to make a MBB&amp;J sammich at home. The angus beef sliders are crazy good. You'll want to up your order to 4 instead of 3 because they're that delicious.

Although I am lapsed, there is something extremely comforting about entering a church, sitting on a cool pew, hearing the sounds of an organ wafting through, eating the wafer, and having some of the Blood of Christ.  Fat Angel is cool and comforting. \u00a0As part of a non-traditional St. Patrick's night adventure, a very cool friend (I was cool enough to come here by association) suggested we come here as a last stop. \u00a0He had mentioned that it was his favorite \"local\" many times so I was anxious to try it out, but hadn't the opportunity (meaning I'm clearly not doing a good enough job stalking him).  As this was the end of an already fun evening, I will definitely have to go back to gather more details. \u00a0Here's what I do know:  -The owner/bartender is awesome. \u00a0He probably thinks I'm less awesome since I was saying lame things, but people really should get used to me saying lame things. \u00a0Answered all my questions, even if they were completely random and not appropriate. \u00a0 -The decor is primarily made up of a church in Napa that was about to be demolished, complete with pews and the pipes from an organ. \u00a0 It's a place where you can relax and have a soul-searching conversation with a friend, or have a first date. \u00a0This place is devoid of snobbery. -Although they don't have a full bar (which I prefer, keeps me out of trouble), they have wine on tap. \u00a0I really like this way of doing wine, especially since they have tastes, glasses, half-carafes and full carafes. \u00a0I also got a sample of a unique beer. -They have noms. \u00a0Really good noms. \u00a0An assortment of cheeses, accompanied by crusty bread? \u00a0Yummy. \u00a0A couple of salty meats? \u00a0Double yummy. \u00a0My cool friend? \u00a0Triple yummy. \u00a0Oh wait, he's not on the menu. \u00a0Tried one of the sliders as well, which I believe they said they could make without the onions. \u00a0  Bottom line? \u00a0This is my new local, even though it's nowhere near local to me. \u00a0I have fallen madly and truly in love with Fat Angel, which probably has Eros hidden somewhere. \u00a0Oh god.  Oh FYI, we're having a UYE here. \u00a0Soon.",

So I was sad, called all the people I needed to call to report everything, taped it up, and then needed something to calm me down and lift my spirits.   A friend had told me he'd had a really nice evening at Fat Angel the other weekend, so I made my way over and snuggled up to the bar. I was one of those annoying people who wasn't sure whether I wanted a draft Syrah or draft Stout, so I made the bartender help me figure it out. Star #1 is for the fact that they had both draft Syrah and 2 stouts (among other fantastic drink options), and Star #2 is for the sweet bartender who was patient enough to help me find my way to a fantastic stout that hit the spot.  Wanting to eat my feelings -- but just a little -- I then made the bartender help me decide between a cheese plate and a butter plate. I went with the Chocolate Cinnamon butter with toasted bread, which earned Star #3 because it. was. perfection.  Star #4 is for the ambience. I felt totally comfortable writing birthday cards to family and friends while sitting at the bar with my stout and butter. Laid back, not too pretentious -- unless you were one of the fancy pretentious people there, then I guess it could be your scene, too. What I'm saying is, the place is as fancy or low-key as you wanna make it, which I really appreciated.  Star #5 is because I left so happy that I almost forgot about my busted window.",

First off, we were quoted a 40-minute wait -- not bad for 7:30 on a Saturday -- but that 40 minutes quickly turned into an hour wait. With no end in sight, we patiently sat at the bar... For another 15 minutes.   Just as we were nearing our breaking point, a couple who had JUST walked in was seated immediately. As it turned out, the front patio -- which had been mostly empty durning our wait -- was first-come-first-served, that just isn't disclosed. The hostess made it seem like we should have known that on our own.   Overall, this is a great place for a beer, but it would appear that they treat guests like cattle -- herded when convenient, and unremarkable. We won't go back to find out what we missed.",

I searched around on Yelp for places in the area so we could just park one time and walk over to the show afterwards. I found this place on here and saw the good reviews so we decided to try it out. We got here around 6 p.m. and sat up at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and nice! The place became very crowded as the evening went on, probably because of the show at the Fillmore. It was fun, classy and overall a stellar time! It was a place to go for food, wine, good beers and you can laugh in there without the whole place noticing even though it is a smaller place. We ordered the boar salami, truffle oil mushroom flatbread, a bleu cheese, maple bacon butter, lemon caper butter, bacon macaroni and cheese, sliders and chicken pot pie. This was more than enough food for four very hungry people! \u00a0All of the food was very good with the only disappointment being the chicken pot pie. The pot pie was only luke warm and very bland. Next time I would opt for a salad because they were huge and looked amazing. It seemed like the kitchen was a bit disorganized if they were busy but I am sure that will be worked out in time, they are fairly new. As for the drinks we ordered the Pinot Nior on tap, Pranqster beer, a specialty bottle beer and a glass of each of the two Pinots. The 2006 Carneros Pinot was out of this world, highly recommend it. The highlights definitely were that Pinot, maple bacon butter, macaroni and cheese and the truffle oil flatbread. I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and experience and will go back soon, even when I am not going to see a show at the Fillmore.",

When the fries became cool... it tasted just awful. Wasn't a fan.  Tomatoes, basil, spicy sausage flat bread: this was pretty good. I really liked the ricotta and sausage!  Mac n cheese: The toppings were delicious and perfect but below the toppings seemed really dry... a bit hard to swallow? Regardless, the toppings made up for it, I guess.  Sliders: no no no! First bite was SOOO GOOD... then it just felt really oily and buttery and eck... made me feel a bit sick after.  Chicken pot pie: I've had better... a bit too thick and creamy for my taste.  I dont know... I really wish I could give this place more stars but I really wasn't impressed. Maybe it was just an off day for the kitchen... I'd like to come back and give it another go though.

Subtly sweet roasted grapes complement pungent gorgonzola pebbles on warm flatbread.   Unsnobby wine snobs can finally be as cool as the beer kids and order a variety of wines on tap. Talk to Cyric or Jason about the science behind this madness. Cool!  Think up-scale hole-in-the-wall. Great for splitting plates and second dates :)  ~$20-30 for a good time/person",

Walked right in with a friend of mine around 7pm. \u00a0Nice dark and intimate atmosphere; perfect for a date, or catching up with an old friend. \u00a0  I'll cut right to the chase. Here's what we ordered...  -House Olives $4 Simple marinade of olive oil and maybe garlic. No variety, only the green olives not pitted. Where my Kalamata's at?! Got very redundant, needed more herbs.   -Maple bacon butter w/ bread $4.50 Some wheat bread and maple bacon butter. Maple Bacon butter was interesting. Overall meh. I was sold with the maple bacon butter.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F5Y4U38GnSAnCCilmu1FYMA%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=02e21e2550d7c28dbcc8cb172708b5722c8343de9f9cc69ac4b4a4b7ee883983\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a>  -Wipeout Lager 23oz $8.50 Nice full bodied dark beer.   -Peter Brown Ale 23oz $8.50  -Sliders $10 for 3, we added $3 for 1 more.  Delicious!! Bun was soft, bacon, caramelized onions, aioli. Came together so nicely, best slider I have ever had, hands down. \u00a0 \u00a0  -3 cured meats ( duck salami, speck, chorizo) \u00a0$15.  Duck salami was melt in your mouth, chorizo was a bit oily, but the mustard and bread countered it nicely. Had to ask for more mustard, they only give you a small half dollar sized dollop. Tons of those little baguettes. \u00a0This was perfect.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FKi2pbk7yjAcndoxGFaDo0Q%2Fl.jpg&amp;s=a027c547babdc5264f7e71866cbce08ea50ec81eddf85d0b019892d0b9999cdc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026</a>  Conclusion: We ordered a lot, since it was our first time, we wanted to get a taste of everything. \u00a0Next time I come back, which will be very soon, i'm going to order the sliders, 3 meats and a few beers. \u00a0Skip the apps, olives, bread, go straight for the good stuff!   Total was $58.05 for two, before tax. \u00a0Quite reasonable, given how much we ordered.

The eclectic mix of various new and old world wines is certainly more than adequate for a night of drinks and food. It probably wouldn't get noticed by WineSpectator, but the selection should be satisfactory to all but the most snobbish wine drinkers. The beer list is several pages long and quite a few are on tap as well. I'm more of a wine drinker than a beer drinker myself. But since this place is clearly known for the beers they serve, I just told the bartender that I liked hefeweizens and just give me whatever they have on tap that was closest to it. I don't remember the name of the beer I got, but I was happy with it.  From the kitchen I ordered the Basil pesto, black olives, roasted tomatoes &amp; sausage w/ ricotta flat-bread. The bread itself was paper thin and crunchy yet still strong enough to support the tasty toppings. My only complaint is that I think sausage is a bit overpowering flavorwise. It still went well with my beer.  The waitress suggested I try the mac n' cheese which I ordered as well. She warned me that it was very hot. I dismissed her warning thinking she probably has to say that to everyone because she has to deal with a lot of people who are not used to eating spicy food. When the mac n' cheese arrived, I was a bit surprised because it was hot! Not so spicy that it was inedible, but spicy enough that you really wanted that beer to take the burn away.  Only two bartenders were holding down the fort all night and I must say that they did an excellent job of making sure everything was ok and getting all the drinks out.  This place is super popular with the locals. Either get here early or expect to wait.",

I guess it used to be part of an old church or something because the remanents of an original organ is in there and there are some restored wood seating (pews?).   It always seems to be happening, but it's just so tiny, it seems the other tables are always on top of you and when it's full it's hard to hear anything over the din.

I have tried the flatbreads, mac n cheese,sliders, and the caeser salad, all of which were very tasty! The salads come family style, sharable 3-4 people. And delicious!! The vibe in here is cool and casual, with a beautifully lit ambiance from the candles and smooth reclaimed bar,equipped with brass pipes from an old church organ.

My boyfriend, my mom and I arrived around 5 PM and we were the only ones there, which was nice because we had the undivided attention of the servers. We ordered the sausage flatbread, the endive salad and the smoked trout with greens. My mom also ordered a coffee which was freshly made, one cup at a time. It was delicious!  The food didn't take long to come out but at first we thought they had forgotten to give us the additional chicken we ordered for the endive salad. They didn't forget, they just brought it out later so no problem there. I really enjoyed the sausage flatbread because the bread was really thin and the arugula went really well with the sausage and tomato. I think I ate about half of it by myself lol. The endive salad was pretty good but I wouldn't recommend ordering the chicken as a side, because it was pretty dry. The trout on the other hand was very tasty, and the greens were delicious.  We didn't order any drinks (aside from the coffee), so I can't comment on that except for the fact that 75% of the menu encompassed libations which was interesting. It also can be a bit difficult to flag down your server once it gets busy; my mom needed another coffee and she had to go up to the bar to let them know.",

The cool inviting bar with the organ-like pipes way above, the enormous elk greeting everyone who arrives, and my favorite: the chandelier that reminds me of the one on James Cameron: \u00a0The Titanic.

The overall vibe and clientele is somewhat eclectic and granola, so no need to dress up, but who really does in SF unless it's a high-end sit-down dinner.  Small food menu but amazingly delicious.

Wide and interesting selection of unique beers and wines on tap for decent prices with a selection of snacks like cheeses, salami, mac and cheese, sliders, etc. Not really a dinner place, more of an after-dinner/late-night spot. The wine list is written in a fun, accessible way.  Perfect for hanging with any amount of friends, whether it's catching up with one pal or filling one of the bigger tables and getting stuff to share. In my experience it's been crowded/full but we never had to wait... it's relatively noisy but that's to be expected where people are drinking, eating, and making merry :) In its way it kind of reminds me of an old fashioned tavern, though the decor is classy.  Servers are efficient and friendly enough, but not overly so.  This is more of a 4.5 review. The only thing I really had a problem with... and this is just my preference, at the time I went they had a lack of any quality \"lighter\" beers. For their entire list/selection, even after I asked the bartender, there was only 1 lager that was very cheap compared to the others. I really enjoy Belgian beers, wheat beers, etc, and from a place that aims to have an extensive beer list I wanted more of my favorite beer \"genre\" to choose from! Although... checking their menu now I see a Belgian listed called \"Beer of the Future\".... I MUST RETURN FOR THAT. Further scrutiny shows that more such beers have appeared on their list, so I guess I can give them a whole-hearted 5 stars next time!  Oh yes, and did I mention they have MAPLE. BACON. BUTTER.??  EDIT: They serve brunch now on Saturday (during the Farmer's Market in the Fillmore area) and have an unusual/different selection, although you could get \"normal\" items too (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc). I had a really tasty breakfast sandwich. My roomie got a pink mimosa (pricey but good) and the breakfast potatoes, which were seriously good and a pretty big portion for $4! My other friend got the \"Ploughman's Lunch\" which is a nice little salami/cheese/fruit plate that comes with a small beer (though he traded it out for OJ, ha). Overall it was enjoyable but getting any \"adult\" beverages hikes up the tab quickly. The food/normal drinks are reasonably priced.",

The wine list is superb, the bartender (and only person working the front on a Monday night) was friendly and knowledgeable.   We tried the special zucchini flatbread and the mushroom flatbread. Both were exquisite. Healthy pizza on a cracker.   Also worth mentioning - the softest toilet paper I've ever experienced in a public place! And I usually don't care about such things.  My only complaint was that it was a bit pricey. My friend and I had two flatbreads and two glasses of wine each - we shared a third - and we spent about $60. If you stick to the Happy Hour menu, you could lower that considerably.",

    "review_text": "I aim for variety when it comes to food/drink, especially since our fair city lends itself well to culinary discovery. However, when it comes to establishments that do it well (and consistently), I am a creature of habit.   Fat Angel does not have an extensive menu, but what they do have is a well-balanced selection of basics. The outlined food categories nicely fit one page... and it covers the necessities: Appetizers (Angel's Share), Cheese, Meat, Butter, Greens, Flatbread, Plates. The kale salad is unmatched - marcona almonds, \u00a0bacon, and the right touch of champagne dressing. No arguments about the chicken pot pie, as it is exactly how I envision a perfect savory pie to be (probably used a cup full of butter to have reached said perfection, but who's caring?). The spicy mac/cheese is pure bliss on a mini skillet. Still want more, you say? The Grape/Gorgonzola/Prosciutto flatbread is the way to go.  Are you judging my diet yet? Did you miss the part about me crushing on a salad?   Oh the beers. Amazing beers on tap that rotate frequently based on season and featured microbrews. Some of the best variety offered in SF, but you end up liking one - drink up, as chances are that beer will be gone in 2 days and it may be while until they get another limited batch. They also have an excellent selection of bottled beers that covers a range of palates. Wine on tap more your groove? I've only tried the Sauvignon Blanc (Martella?) and Pinot Noir (Copain), both decent, but in a place like Fat Angel - with all the beer selections and so little time? Go for the brew.   The staff knows their stuff. Friendly, fun, and - I'll emphasize this - patient. You in need of figuring out what kind to get, given the otherwise intimidating selection? Engage them in conversation, and they'll make several recommendations (armed with samples)... after which you complete your selection and indulge happily. Let this be a lesson to other establishments: It pays to have a crew who is knowledgeable and passionate about the very things the place stands for. Need I spell out why? Because they generate fans who, not only (willingly) shell out $XX regularly for food and drinks, but ones who give gratitude over a public space like Yelp - even at the risk of getting a longer wait for a table on a Friday night.",

Anyhoo... When I think of fat angels I think of cherubic funny little butterballs with wings and trouble on their minds or me after I have eaten a donut.  So imagine my amusement when I saw in the pouring rain, the way to Fat Angel because of the shiny golden angel they have floating above their entrance. It is SO like a sign from the heavens right?!?  WELL....this place is an utter and absolute gem. It is smaller than what I thought, but it made for a really cozy, intimate atmosphere which is perfect for a girls night out, a romantic date or a nice glass of wine by yourself at the bar after a long day. The gorgeous chandelier is brilliant in its sparkly goodness (yay sparkles!) and the decor is rustic old man cigar \u00a0room charm.  I ordered a nice glass of viognier and enjoyed some cheese and salami appetizers and then had the sliders.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OMG.  The sliders? What can I say? They were pure, unadulterated deliciousness on a lightly buttered bun with this amazing garlic aioli that had me licking my fingers \u00a0and moaning with pleasure like some sort of porn star. A--mazing. I don't know how the mac and cheese or the pot pie taste, but if they are half as good as the sliders, I'm going to have to watch it before I make a one woman spectacle of myself in the corner.  The service was great and friendly. They were busy so it was a little bit of time before I got my order in, but it was also a small staff serving a bunch of people and I was in absolutely no rush. But the bartender and the servers were super friendly and down to earth.  I am excited to have this great place in the neighborhood as the Fillmore needs some more down to earth and classy establishments (without the hype of a place like Yoshis). \u00a0It adds a nice member to my repertoire of places to go out and I highly recommend it.  *Unless of course you take up a seat when I want to go there in which case move it buddy or else a fat angel is going to be coming for you.*",

    "review_text": "Fat Angel is located right next to the busy Fillmore St., and is obverse to a small park. At nighttime, the whole park is lighten up by a blue LED light projected from the top of a marvelous building. The effect turns the park into a visionary scene from the movie Avatar. It's really quite beautiful.  The cute fat angel statue is hanging on the restaurant, smiling and waving to every incoming customer.  An interesting fact is that Fat Angel doesn't carry mainstream beers. My beer-drinker boyfriend had no idea what to order when there were strange beer brands from that stretched from England to the Netherlands and everywhere in-between. Finally, the owner recommended us to try an English bitter: Engels Brouwerij De Molen. The beer had a similar taste to my Alan's favorite beer, Blue Moon. Compared to Blue Moon, the body of Engels is a little bit lighter, but very smooth.  A lot of previous customers of Fat Angel recommended the Chicken PotPie on yelp. I decided to give it a try for this first time visit, which I found to be quite an interesting dish indeed. For the chicken potpie, the owner recommended me to pair the pie with a white or red wine with a light body. I craved for the red wine on this beautiful night, so I went with the glass of red to soothe my cravings. In the end, I decided to go with what the owner had suggested, a Grenache from Santa Cruz, CA, Birichino 'Vieilles Vignes.' \u00a0My, was it wonderful.  Although the look of Fat Angel's chicken potpie was different from a traditional potpie, it still has the ability to fill up a gigantic stomach. My stomach was about to explode after I've barely finished a half of the potpie. All ladies have to be ready to ask their boyfriends to finish what is left from this gigantic dish! The powdery sauce was smooth, thick, pure, fresh and brisk. The Pot Pie and Grenache from Santa Cruz paired quite well with each other, but they where not perfect. I couldn't help but keep my mind stimulated by looking for another pairing to perfect this wine and potpie collaboration and \u00a0build a stronger relationship between the taste buds within my mouth.  I will definitely go back to Fat Angel to give a second look at their well-known cheese served w/ organic Firebrand Bread and seasonal accents.  Cheers!",

While I don't know if that will be a lasting relationship, I have to say I was still impressed with this establishment as a business of its kind.  I had not known of Fat Angel despite the fact that I live 4 blocks away. I hang out quite a bit on Fillmore street - more around J-town/Pac Heights area, but still, Fillmore street has everything my Webster street lacks. I was pleasantly surprised to be invited here one night and discovered that not only is this a \"bar\", it's a wine bar - WITH FOOD. Great food.  On a busy Sunday night there was one man running the show. He was behind the bar mostly making drinks. But he was also somehow waiting all those tables, cleaning up after tables (right away, too), and doing his job with such quickness that lacked the appearance of chaos. He didn't even lose his cool or raise his voice, NOT ONCE. The place isn't too big - maybe seats 25 people, max. But the place was PACKED. And it's easy to know why.  They not only have great wine and beer selections (I had some FANTASTIC IPA and more pinot noir, on the house) they also have wonderful fare. I had some of the best Mac&amp;cheese of my life, a tasty and crispy flatbread, and the absolute best apple bread pudding of my life, served with a huge dollop of real whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream. It was a large serving of desert for only 6 bucks, a portion large enough to go around between probably three people. I don't know what they put into the bread pudding - nutmeg? But it was killer, not like any other bread pudding I'd eaten before. It was perfectly creamy and eggy but there was something else about it I haven't found in other bread puddings. It was creamy, crispy , rich, warm, gooey, not too sweet, and subtly spicy in a way I can't describe, really.   What an awesome place to hang out in the neighborhood. Furnished with a curved bench, individual marble tables and matching antique chairs, antique sconces, matching mirrors, and beautiful, dark mahogany wood and cherry blossoms, this was a great spot for me to enjoy a low-key night with good musicians and better friends. Since my roommate and I are on almost exact opposite schedules except about once a week, once she turns 21 I have a feeling date nights are going to happen here often.",

When telling the waitress she simply said that the kitchen staff is from Mexico and that's why it's spicy.... ??????? Never heard such a thing B4. Wines were good but service was non-existent. After seating at a table for 15 minutes we had to get up to order at the bar. When they brought us the food there was no napkins, silverware or water until we got a glimpse of the busboy and asked him for those items. Even to ask for another wine and the bill we had to go to the bar, but a group of girls next to us had a waiter coming to them all the time... Would not recommend.",

My friends and the waiter got into a really enthusiastic conversation about one of the beers and the brewery that makes it. He was definitely very knowledgable.   The food was also delicious! We ordered the garlic chilli butter to share and my boyfriend couldn't help but eat over half the butter himself. It was really flavorful. We also ordered the mushroom flatbread, the sliders, and the mac and cheese. My friends really like the sliders, especially served with the pickled hot peppers. The Mac and Cheese was probably one of the best I have ever had. The flatbread in comparison was just okay.   Note that the place is small so you may have a long wait. We waited probably 40 minutes, but we really enjoyed our experience so I guess it was worth it.",

I told the waiter that we had a nice meal that was let down by the sliders. There comes the weird part. The waiter became very defensive and started offering a partial refund of the sliders. His argument was that we ate two and left one, so he could refund us 33% of the sliders. WTF is this? I didn't ask for any refund and was not expecting one. But offering a refund of 33% of $10 is just a joke. I told him so, and he went to talk to his manager. He came back and told us that we will be completely refunded.

They always seem generally annoyed to serve you.  2) The beer selection is diminished - as a bar this is bad. If you have 3 double IPAs and no belgian beers on tap, you're doing it wrong.  3) They do not appreciate repeat business.

Both wines were airy; I'm assuming this was from the fact that it came from a tap. There were lots of little air bubbles in the cab that made it seem relatively light for the style. Flavor-wise both were good although a bit on the expensive side for what they are.   Also tried the flatbread with bacon, anchovies, goat cheese, and onions. It was huge, although since the bread is so thin, we managed to polish it off between two people. It was okay, but nothing extraordinary.

It may sound weird, but I really liked the buns on the sliders.   As for drinks, I got a nice MIkkeller stout, which was, as my server informed me, fruitier than stouts tend to be. Delicious, nonetheless.  I don't know if I came in on a good night, or if some of the reviewers came in on a bad night, but I thought the service was good.

My only peeve: Got here at 6:45 p.m., left at 9:45 p.m., and not necessarily by choice. We didn't exactly have one server (more like 4) and honestly, we felt a little forgotten. Despite the lack of consistency and communication in terms of service, I will be back. Not the best choice if your intention is to have an organized dinner, but it's great for drinks &amp; snacks.",

    "review_text": "I usually don't write reviews, however our experience at this restaurant was quite horrible to the point where I felt there was a need to share.  This was our second visit to Fat Angel. We came here on around 10:30 and were seated after a couple of mins since we were also getting dinner. The place looked quite unorganized, the bartender was also the server and there were only another female server for a crowded place.   We sat down and ordered our drinks. The drinks came momentarily, after we told them we were ready to order. He got our order in, there were a couple of other tables behind us who ordered later. We waited for almost 20mins for our cold cut plate. I don't know how long it takes to slice meat. But as I looked up, the tables who ordered way later already received their cold cut plates and salads! When my bf tried to speak to the waiters, they ignored him. I managed to catch the attention of the female waitress and explained to her that everyone else who ordered after us had received their food, even the hot plates yet we only had drinks.   After 5-10 mins, our food began to come. The male server who was also the bartender made no attempt to explain or apologize for the significant delay, and acted as if nothing had happened. When we ordered dessert, they made no attempt to clear our table full of plates, instead piled the dessert plate on our stacked table. We had to essentially gather our own plates to have them being taken away.   As for the food, the cold cut platter was standard. The chicken pot pie was quite good, but the salad was overly dressed and soggy since it probably had been sitting on the counter for a long time. The creme brulee was average. After this experience, the poor management and avg. food, it is safe to say we will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone or coming anymore.",

Looking at the menu, I was amused that 90% of the items were alcoholic beverages. \u00a0I came for the food...which can be found on the last page, hehe.  So here's what my girlfriends and I shared:  FLATBREAD - $13 ($2 off during Happy Hour) Tomatoes, basil, spicy sausage, &amp; arugula w/ ricotta Although simple, this was amazing. \u00a0I love the subtle spice of the sausage, the thin crispyness of the crust (which was not at all greasy), and the arugula that paried so well along with the ricotta. \u00a0All the ingredients was just the right amount and this plate was a great one for sharing. \u00a0I loved it!  MAC 'N CHEESE - $11 Gruy\u00e8re, aged cheddar, parmigiano-reggiano I came here for this dish right here. \u00a0I\"m happy that it was so spicey like many people thought. \u00a0If anything I tasted no spice which was fine. \u00a0I loved how the top layer was crispy...and yes this dish was quite greacy...but hey its why I love mac n cheese! \u00a0Be careful though, it comes out SUPER hot! \u00a0This ooey-gooey cheesy dish was a fave!  F.A.'S CHICKEN POT PIE - $12 Roast chicken, carrots, sherry, tarragon  I was quite impressed with this one mainly because it didn't look like a pie. \u00a0It looked like there was a thick flakey buttery thing of pastry on top and beneath the filling. \u00a0Otherwise the filling was out in the open so you see exactly what you're getting. \u00a0Just your standard chicken pot pie filling but what made it unique was the \"crust\". \u00a0Yum!  3 SLIDERS - $10 Beef, caramelized onions, bacon, Irish cheddar, aioli Oh so tasty! \u00a0Simple but I appreciate it not being dry. \u00a0I love the little pickled peppers it came with...it compliments it SO well. \u00a0I felt the aioli tasted like ranch dressing..but its not a complaint. \u00a0I enjoyed it. \u00a0  Its unfortunate I didn't try any drinks since I feel its their main thing...but I'm happy to have tried their food because it was amazing. \u00a0Parking was fairly easy for me (I came around 5:45pm and stayed until 6pm since its free after that). \u00a0The restaurant itself is quite small, intimate, but not jam packed. \u00a0It does become a full house and I felt we got lucky finding an empty table immediately. \u00a0Great food, great company, and exceptional service...whats there to complain?",

The staff is friendly and bar has a cozy bistro feeling. The happy hour specials are $2 off wine and beer, $1 off the flatbreads. We had a half bottle of the draft Zinfandel (juicy and smooth), a half bottle of the draft Sauvignon Blanc (crisp and refreshing) and the wild mushroom and truffle oil flatbread (delish!). The place filled up quickly and was crackin'! They even had a large antler taxidermy on the back wall next to their chalkboard, which had a catchy saying from Hemingway and list of 8 beers on draft.

It worked out perfectly for us each time. This is because the 2 owners (also the only servers) are knowledgeable and dedicated. I feel at home here, truly.  Yes, it is very, very dimly lit. \u00a0This suits the cozy atmosphere if you ask me. It reminds me of the many small wine bars I visited in Madrid and the South of France.   The tables are a bit uneven, true. \u00a0Doesn't bother me enough to deduct a star though.  I really appreciate the thought they put into their menu. The section names and wine descriptions are clever.   Love that they bring you a full carafe of water right away. The water glasses are pretty small so this is helpful as the small bar tends to get pretty warm when full.   ~Favorites~ FOOD -Wild Mushroom Flatbread (love the sea salt), and love the wooden palate it's served on.

Was not even a plan to come here tonight, but DOSA was not open when we needed and then it hot me! FAT ANGEL! We walked to two dirty blocks literally dodging wacky homeless people and some other very interesting characters. Definitely do NOT walk around this area after dark alone or with a group of girls and no guys or big lesies to protect cuz it gets real SKETCHY! This area was one of many SF former neighborhoods I lived in as an adolescent and early adult, so I know very well that this is not an okay place to be vulnerable in. Aside form this we walk in with no resies and are immediately seated. Very small place for which I was shocked by. Smelled amazing and the place was not packed yet. My fiend and I were greeted by a super nice women who was helpful off the bat in describing everything for us. We decided to each get this PIMM's cocktail which was odd but unique. If you get this then STIR IT! It does not look like it needs to be stirred, but it does! The bottom is where the cava liquor is.  Once we discovered that, it was super yummy! We ordered the endive salad and the mac an cheese. NOTE about the mac: there is much more to it than shown on the menu. It is not a basic mac and cheese. It is spacey and filled with seasoning not typical of mac and cheese. I think it was a chipotle type seasoning so if that's a problem let them know in advance in case they can make it without.  The salads are HUGE! Enough for 3-4 people. Far too much for us. There is a reason they are around $11 each.....because they are the meal! At some point out waitress asked if we wouldn't mind moving over one table because this large group without a resie walked in. We had zero issues moving and as such, the owner gave us a large and super amazing creme brulee on the house! SOOOO nice and so sweet! We would definitely return. Service is stellar and food is super yummy. Got out of these for $42. Not bad at all!",

The alcohol selection cannot be beat. Great beers, great wines (about six or so on tap, which made them wonderfully cheap. The others from bottles were reasonably priced.)  I didn't get a chance to chance to snag a menu but lots of people were eating things like cheese plates and salads here. Stuff that goes well with wine, I assume.  Plus, I love the name so damn much. They even do have a little fat angle statue flying above the doorway. It's a win for sure.  It's a very very intimate spot with great lighting, so maybe not so good of the large group we rolled in with (most of us were scatted at different tables and a few stood).

    "review_text": "We showed up at Fat Angel for dinner last night. Were told there is a 45mins wait, which as I am beginning to realize is normal for SF. We stood outside sipping wine and were finally able to sit at a table outside to wait. But soon realized that the staff was seating other parties of 4 inside, even though they came after us. When we complained our server told us that he had called out our name a couple of times but no one answered, so they seated someone else. Wtf? He was ok bringing us wine outside but not coming to get us for our table when it was our turn. They would have gotten a 1 star if it were not for the owner who saved the night. He came and apologized for the server. Comp'd our dessert and even took a decent chunk off our tab. Kudos to the owner for great customer service. The wait staff needs to learn from him.",

This sweet, angelic spot exudes upscale lodge with a casual chic feel: marble bar, pew style booth seating and a handsome wall holding some crafted brews and carefully chosen vino. Don't mind the imposing Moosehead hanging above, Rocky and Bullwinkle totally approve.  Fat Angel seamlessly blends fantastic wine bar food with excellent tipples. The menu is 90% alcohol (as it should be!) beers are arranged according to your taste: light, crisp, heavy, dark. Same for the wines and for those who aren't feeling both, they offer several aperitifs as well.   It felt a little stuffy inside because of the rain, otherwise, I can imagine sitting here for hours on a warm SF night with the bay windows wide open. A crisp and zesty Picpoul was affordably priced at $8/glass. \u00a0My gf loves Riesling and this one from Kabinett is a richer style with sweetness in the end. \u00a0Of course, you can't go wrong with a Hefeweizen (Ayinger) or a dark stout like Double Chocolate Stout from England or a breakfast stout from Mikeller Bar (the Danes KNOW beer!)  All this imbibing made us hungry: we devoured an excellent meat board with speck, salami and duck terrine. On the board were also FLAVORED BUTTERS like maple bacon and Philz coffee. You wouldn't be able to resist spreading these on toast! The flatbread pizzas are pleasingly light, even with rich toppings such as gorgonzola, prosciutto and grapes on it. The chicken pot pie had a really flaky crust, but I didn't taste anything special about the tarragon cream sauce.   Hark the herald angels sing and glory to ... the genius who brought Fat Angel to San Francisco. Let's say Amen to that!",

Last night (Thursday) we decided to give it a go.   I am proud to say I am a total food and wine snob and was very impressed. We got the Cesar Salad, Mac and Cheese, chicken pot pie and drinks. I tried the draft white, BF had the Casey Jones draft beer. The drinks were marvelous the food UH-mazing.   So much so, in fact, that at 5:30 (AM!!) this morning my boyfriend and I were once again discussing the merits of Fat Angel! In particular, the Pot Pie; me, being an borderline alchie, was thinking about the draft wine, while nodding that the pot pie was most excellent.

Eventually some one came up with the brilliant idea of going to the first bar that we saw. Since I live quite literally across the street from Fat Angel, this ended up being our spot.  It was really cute and cozy inside and the wine list was extensive without being completely overwhelming. We shared a bottle of red wine that is made in somebody's garage or something and it was well received by all! The best part, however, would be the service. It's a small place, which I suppose helps with the attentiveness of the staff, but it seemed our server was always one step ahead of us.

AND it was totally worth it.  If I lived up in San Francisco, I would be a regular here probably to the point where they would stop serving me. Everything about this place works well together - the vibe, the size, the ambiance, the food... and last, but certainly not least, the beer!  Jessica is on-point. It seems like she covers the bar, the tables, and everywhere on Earth that isn't water. She is all over the place and still on top of things! Not to mention I'm pretty sure the beer selection here is better than anywhere I've ever been. EVER. EVER. EVER. Also Jessica's fault, by the way. Hard to find beers, aged beers, sour beers, reserves - you name it, Fat Angel has it. I had a Mikkeller that I didn't even know existed!  And the food? Amazing. Everyone raves about the Chicken Pot Pie - and of course, they were out of it. But I had the prosciutto flat bread, a three-cheese mac and cheese, and the sliders (which pretty much blew my mind). I would order all of them again. The flat bread had grapes on it, and somehow it still worked with all the other flavors, the mac and cheese had the perfect crust, and the sliders - I literally sat back and closed my eyes they were so good. I wasn't sure I'd make it back alive.  The only thing I wish they had were some fried foods - french fries, sweet potato fries, maybe some onion rings, or eggplant - but everything else was so good, that it wouldn't really make a difference anyway. I'll be back no matter what. I would give this place 10 stars if I could - I just wish I didn't live 450 miles away!",

    "review_text": "I've been here a few times, but this past weekend was review worthy. Thanks to the Ramen fest, the entire area outside of my appt was flooded by starving people who didn't want to wait in a 4 hour line for ramen. Oh man. We wandered until we realized we had 30m until Fat Angel opened, so we sat and waited, so SF.  Cut to 5m before 4, and the waitress on staff comes out to set up the outdoor seating area, and lets us know she is the only one working at the time. Poor girl, there are about 40 of us waiting at this point, and the kitchen doesn't open until 5.   We enter and sit in the corner, while the restaurant fills. The waitress and her barback are running around, taking everyone's orders - it was so fluid and efficient. She did a wonderful job and the staff (of two, haha) was attentive and quick.   We had our drink and appetizer about 15m after being seated, and by the time we were done with our appetizer (pretzel and garlic chili butter YUM!) she came around and took our dinner order.   I got the pot pie, which was amazing, and my husband got the grape flatbread - delicious. I ordered a lavender/black currant cider, which I cannot stop raving about. It was sweet and light, I kept thinking it was a sangria. We followed up that beverage with the sparkling mead - it was an interesting flavor, and effervescent, by the time I went to swallow, it had already turned into bubbles. Highly potent to boot.  All in all, it was a potentially disastrous day that was handled with professionalism and speed. If japantown is taken over by foodies, I would definitely do this again. Only negative is that they seem to have rounded up everything that was on the bill, which made our meal ~$20 more than I had anticipated. Kind of a downer, but things happen I guess?",

Everything was really good, the duck salami and genoa especially stood out.  - 3 sliders (12) -- These were okay. Nothing special.  - Chicken pot pie (13) -- More like a deconstructed pot pie. The portions were huge, and this was delicious. Probably because it had like a pound of butter and cream in it (not listed in the ingredients), and as a lactard, I did not appreciate the after-effects.

It's perfect for me because I fall in between both those categories (in San Francisco definitions).   The wine bar is well decorated with reclaimed, recycled and repurposed materials from around San Francisco. So boho chic. The decorating highlights are the stamped tin roof and the \"99 bottles of wine wall\", aren't they so creative! The prices were average for the city, food was a bit cheaper than expected with the cheese plate being only $5 per cheese whereas you can pay up to $10 for the same sliver of cheese at other bars. The fried capers were delicious and creative. They tasted like the little fried bits of popcorn you find on the bottom of the bowl chocked full of salt and buttery deliciousness. I don't know how they made them, but keep it up. There is a wide selection of house made butters with all sorts of fun flavors like maple bacon and flatbreads to fill the tummy's of those who have a hard time just grazing. The theme for happy hour is \"whine after work\" which we all need from time to time, $1 off draft wines and beers and $2 off flat breads. What is draft wine you ask? Its the barrel of wine directly from the vineyard hooked up to a tap system similar to how bars serve beer. It's a fabulous idea and quite entertaining to check out. I'd never had draft wine outside of a vineyard before but I'll definitely come back to try out every kind. That's just the kind of dedicated blogger I am.   Fat Angel is my new favorite local spot! Plus the name is entertaining. It reminds me of the Lyle Lovett song, \"Fat Babies Have No Pride\" which still puts a smile on my face. Poor fat babies.",

I'm NO wine connoisseur, but the mental image I get is being poured a glass from a cardboard box of Franzia that has a harsh vinegary finish. *cringes*   Boy, did Fat Angel prove me wrong...my 2009 Pinot Noir Canihan Sonoma, CA ($9.50/glass) is the BEST RED WINE I'VE EVER HAD!!! It was soft, seamlessly smooth and juicy with vibrant berry and aromatic floral tones. It trumps my favorite (now former) 2007 Montelena Estate Cabernet Sauvignon at Press Club ($27.50/glass). For someone that needs 6-8 shots of Goose to get a good buzz, two glasses were enough to give me the giggles. Talk about a bang for your buck!  Don't forget to pair your fabulous glass of draft wine or beer with one of their delectable flatbreads. My friend and I split the Roasted Grapes, Walnuts, Prosciutto w/ Gorgonzola ($9) which was mouth-watering. With a slightly blistered crust, the flatbread was warm and crunchy with the perfect balance of salty, savory, smoky, nutty and pungency with a sweet tang. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W0mlelgnkSPU3ELhyzkXHA?select=pJm9j_ek_W13h61ae_pCVg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/W0ml\u2026</a>  Initially, I was skeptical about their draft wines but don't knock it till you try it.

Pot pie = extraordinary. A real charcuterie plate. And a really eclectic and inventive beer menu that stood out in a town where Racer 5 has turned into the local equivalent of Miller Lite as far as distribution. And best of all, few crowds and attentive service.  Then came this evening (a Tuesday, no less), as I walked into the restaurant. To myself: \"Whoa, is that guy wearing dark-rimmed glasses? What are we, on Valencia?\" \"Hold on, is this a line on a Tuesday night for a table?\" And then, \"Oh no, I'm sensing a lot of plaid and male skinny jeans in this room.\" Then I realized that I walked by a few bikes on the way in. Oh. No.  That's right. This place has been uncovered by hipsters. For that, I would love to give this place zero stars, but I just can't. Despite the fact that service was unusually slow (trying hard not to blame the huge influx of hipsters), everything else was great as usual.  Just remember when a hipster tells you that they \"found\" an amazing new place on the fringe of Western Addition: random yuppie asian people were there first.",

The restaurant is pretty small, so it took a while for them to be able to seat our odd numbered group. We had initially come here for outdoor seating, but the outdoor tables are best for groups of two or three so we just went inside, which was fairly loud because of the acoustics of the room. Sort of works for the vibe of the restaurant, just don't plan to have any intimate conversations here as you'll have to talk fairly loudly for your friends/date to hear.  We ordered the mac &amp; cheese (yum), chicken pot pie (my choice favorite of the night), endive salad (delightfully huge portions), prosciutto flatbread (meh, kind of small and not filling but it'lll be hard to resist ordering one so my review probably won't mean anything to someone who's read this far), and a single cheese (this was the first item to come out and it's safe to say everyone in my group was disappointed at the size of the cheese and the bread). Personally, I was thinking that for $5 I could buy a huge block of muenster cheese and be pretty happy with that.  Overall, it was a nice place to try but I wasn't made into a regular. I feel like the food menu is overpriced by $2-3 for each item. But if nothing else, we did come to the conclusion that we should throw our own wine and cheese party at home, so I guess this place is good for getting the social creative juices flowing",

Love the sweet and sour beer, but stay away from the wild berries under sours. It tastes like cough syrup. Bleh.  Food: Can't complain here either. Food was solid and tasty. The caesar salad is huge! Comes in a giant wooden bowl. Enough for three or four people. We also had the mac n cheese, sliders, and the pretzel.   Lastly, my favorite part. The ambience. It's a quaint neighborhood spot.

It was a beautiful place, very dark with a brown and mahogany color scheme. This was before the whole lodge thing was en vogue. I'd like to think that my dreamscape is ahead of the times.  Fat Angel kind of looks like the place in my dreams, but it's lighter, better decorated, and just cooler, without being too cool. There are animals overhead, a pipe organ, a beautiful bar, and, in contrast to my dingy and dreary nightmare, it's light filled and sunny-even if the streets are shrouded in fog.   I could see myself here on the regular. Wine on tap-in particular a robust Pinot. There are beers for people who speak of Trappist monks and hidden abbeys-special brews from round the world of which I know nothing, but whose stories are told by the lips of those who know. The food is warm, and stands alone from the libations. When a patron ordered a bread pudding, the whole place smelled wonderful. I like places that are small enough that you are attune to what others are enjoying. Fat Angel passes that test. Everyone was piqued by this warm and fragrant dessert, which evoked as many memories as that damn Proustian madeline. Warm and spiced apples can always tap into your past.

Fat Angel is a little bit on the pricey end, but I think I'm just spoiled by all the places to get a cheap drink in SF. It's not the place to go for a cheap happy hour beer, but it's worth it if you're looking to linger and savor your food, drink, and company.

They've got a fabulous selection of wine (you gotta love a place that has wine on tap) if you're in a vino kinda mood, which very well might strike given the romantic atmosphere.  Overall, a great little spot to sit, sip, and simply enjoy. I'll be back!",

    "review_text": "I know once I finish writing this review I am going to regret it. Reasoning is that this place is so amazing and once this place blows up like it should, I will never get a seat when I come here. But it is my obligation (as my friends reminded me last night) to tell you of this wonderful place.  This place is just what The Fillmore needs, and I am so pissed that I moved away from this neighborhood because 1. It was walking distance to my house, and 2. It's a wine/beer bar that is reasonably priced, has amazing food, and friendly service. Whoever thought of making a bacon butter or a chocolate cinnamon butter needs to patent that shit because those two butters were two of the most amazing parties I have ever had in my mouth. Adding it with their country bread was genius! Looking for a little more substance? Their sliders and \u00a0their Mac n Cheese were both delicious. While the Mac n Cheese was par, their sliders were some of the best sliders I have ever had in my life!  Their wine and beer selection is amazing. While I stuck with the wine side this time, I was extremely impressed with the variety, as well as them being able to cover a lot of regions throughout the world. The owner, who was serving us, was extremely knowledgeable and for my last glass, I made him pick something for me. He ended up picking a beautiful Portuguese wine that was big and bold and fabulous!   The atmosphere is awesome. Small, quaint, perfect for that girls evening where you want to sit at a table and catch up, or for the predate drink where you are sitting at the bar. The owners also have an amazing taste in music, all his own collection. We made him promise that he would never change the music. The whole bar is made from a church organ he was able to snag from napa, and beautifully restored.  I am so glad my friend stumbled upon this and wanted to share it with myself and our girlfriends. We all had nothing but excellent comments about this place and decided this is probably going to be our go to spot when we want to get together for a drink and hang out. I cannot wait to come back here to hang out, have a glass of wine, and relax.   Like I said, I'm already regretting sharing this place with my fellow yelpers.",

    "review_text": "I really like Fat Angel. There's something about it that is so New York... what I love and miss. Packed restaurants, dim candle lit settings, and everyone having a good time. The way Fat Angel was decorated was very thoughtfully planned out. You've got a moose head hanging from a wall, a beautiful chandelier, and a giganto church pew as a seating bench.   Of course, being Friday night, we were greeted with a nice hefty wait. Even the bar area had a wait and usually the bar is first come first serve. My party sat by the bar, but the way the table behind us was placed, there wasn't enough room for someone to be back to back, especially guys. So we made it work while we could before the last person showed up. I ordered a flatbread while waiting and it was fanfreakingtastic. The mushrooms and truffle oil just melted in my hungry mouth. It was going to be an hour wait before we sat down.  As time went by, the owner felt bad for our situation. First we needed a 4th chair by the bar area to wait, but then he told us that someone was getting up and that we'd be seated next. Except the a-holes at the table would not leave for the life of anyone (why would you even do that knowing there's such a long wait? I hate people with no etiquette! If you're done eating, get UP and move your party elsewhere). Anyway, they stayed at the table so long, the owner told us to just stand nearby and pressure them to get up, while the other two in our party sat down next to them. They got the hint and ended up leaving, thankfully.  So... before I proceed to food reviews, just do yourself a favor and go there around 10pm. That's when the madness dies down.  I remember the mac'n'cheese being so good here. And lastly, the sliders were tasty as well. I liked the intimacy of the space and would definitely come back here. Just hope I don't have to wait as long next time!",

By cute and cozy I mean this place is TINY. We were sitting 3 at a table and I was feeling like a giant of sorts. Because the place is small, it usually smells like olive oil and fried things as the kitchen just drifts into the air of the place ... but the bar is cute and their selection of wine and beer is quite extensive.  The thing that surprised me the most, actually, was the fact that they had a large beer list. Who knew, I thought this was a wine bar!  The wait staff are very friendly, and very knowledgable, but seem somewhat rushed since they were sort of looking like they wanted us to get out of there every time we finished a bottle ... but aside from that everything was good. I did enjoy the flat bread, the mac and cheese (yum!), and the deconstructed chicken pot pie. Recommended for a date, especially since it's so dark you can't really see ;) haha ...",

It's a small place, and I think we got lucky on the timing - our wait time really wasn't bad at all.  The drinks are priced anywhere from the regular/affordable and up to a 'sky is the limit' deal - pick what you want. The selections were nice, something for everyone - check out their menu for more to choose from, not just the board.  Very casual atmosphere, hip... all that good stuff - it is a small place, so we were almost elbow to elbow with the table next to us, not that it was a problem.  As food goes, we had the polenta fries (loved it), the maple bacon butter, some of the meat (I can't remember the name), a kale salad, and the mac and cheese - with a drink on the tab, we only came out to $50! If I was going to exclude anything, it would have been the meat - not that it was bad in any way, but the rest of the menu is what I'd suggest trying! It was simply the least memorable part of the meal. The salad in particular stood out for both of us - and an order of that is easily good for three people (we couldn't quite finish it with two of us). The mac &amp; cheese was more on the order of 2 people, I think.  As someone mentioned, if it isn't too breezy that evening, consider bringing a jacket and sitting outside if you want to sit and eat quickly; that evening, I think only one group elected to sit outside, the rest of us waited for a spot inside!",

There is a large selection of beer, wine, and cocktails--the tall poppy I got was definitely nice, with a distinct flavor that I haven't tasted before.  The food items are also equally satisfying, though not cheap--the cheese blocks and the salami items are savory, and aromatic. Also, everyone pretty much orders the mac&amp;cheese, which is cooked just right with a crusty layer of cheese near the center of the plate. mmmmm  The price is definitely on the mid-to-high range, so be aware before stepping in.

In comes, Fat Angel, tucked away in what seems to be a thriving neighborhood compared to yesteryears. \u00a0And with a wide selection of beer, it may be the Western Addition's very own version of dare I say it, Monk's Kettle. \u00a0However, Monk's kettle will always have a place in my heart, but Fat Angel will be the neighborhood's finest. \u00a0  With a nice intimate spot and dim lighting with a good size bar, Fat Angel offers more than what it looks. \u00a0The beer selection on tap may be smaller, but they carry some amazing beers on bottle. \u00a0I was able to try some of the IPA from San Diego, but will definitely come for more other ones. \u00a0  And sitting outside with the heat lamps has its perks as there was a jazz \u00a0dance happening right across the street. \u00a0Quite a spectacle. \u00a0And the food, the food was great compliments to the beer. \u00a0Between my buddies and I, we enjoyed every single bit of it  -Flat Bread with Wild Mushroom and Truffle - amazing. \u00a0Almost like a simplified pizza, but the truffle and mushrooms make this. -Salamate with Truffle - yes I like truffle, but on everything, I'm all game for. \u00a0We had the meat plate and this was definitely the best amongst the other ones which were good too. -Pot Pie - good crisp and flaky crust with an amazing flavorful filling with tender chicken. -Sliders - probably the only thing I could have skipped on, but it was good.",

We didn't have a reservation and it was a Friday night. The hostess took our phone number and said she'd text in 30 minutes or so, when our table was ready. The \"new beers\" chalkboard almost scared us off-- $30 for a beer? But they have a lot of more affordable options among their extensive drinks menu.   The place is small, very small, so if you're waiting for your table on a busy night be prepared to be in everyone's way the entire time. Or, stand outside like we did. Luckily, our table was ready in 20 minutes.  We squeezed into the corner table with our order already ready. A prosciutto flatbread to start, pork sliders and the chicken pot pie to share. We were expecting \"fancy place\" portions but were pleasantly surprised to find fantastically midwest portions. We stupidly filled up on the flatbread, leaving only enough room for 2 sliders for him and 1 slider for myself. We took the chicken pot pie to go and enjoyed it the next day for lunch. Absolutely delicious. Best I've ever had. Wine, beer, appetizer and two entrees? Less than $50 and enough for lunch the next day.   We'll definitely be back!",

We also shared the red grape and prosciutto pizza, a cheese plate, and the sliders. The sliders were the fave but none of it was \"i can't wait to go back and have it again\" good. Our total bill was about $40 which i thought was very reasonable.   I love the low-lit ambiance (I by no means needed a candle to read the menu... ). When we got there at around 6:30 there were only one or two other people seated at the bar. I was disappointed because the last time we stopped by, we were also the only ones. \u00a0It kind of kills the mood when it is silent and empty. It started filling up though by the time we got our food. The chandelier is awesome and I love the big old wooden bar and the corks lining the top.

Now that I've tried their amazing mac &amp; cheese and the chicken pot pie (kind of salty), I'd love to sample their antipasti and organic butter.  As with any other small wine bar, the extensive wine list is unique and has been put together bottle by bottle by the co-owners. I got to chat with one of them about their business venture and the story behind it (the inspiration for the name \"Fat Angel\" actually came from China of all places). If Cyrick isn't too busy, you should flag him down, he's awesome!  The d\u00e9cor is like chapel meets speakeasy. Or maybe it just feels that way since you're sitting in a church pew staring at an organ... downing a bottle of tempranillo. The intimate space is mood-lit by candles and chandeliers--super date-appropriate. Just watch out for slow service on a busy night.

I've walked by it many times especially on Saturdays when the Fillmore Farmers' Market takes place. Now I know what all the rage is about. It's low key, the food is good, and the patrons are locals. Not that this place needs another glowing review (as there are many already), but here are my two cents.  I walked in promptly at 7 on Sunday night to join some friends for dinner. They've been here before and agreed to my recommendation. Clearly, they were also happy former patrons. One of my friends noted their wine selection is among the best, and I saw that as well. They have an extensive wine menu... but I wasn't there for wine. I was there for other libations. So, I ordered the Pimm's Cup: lemonade, Pimms #1, and cava. This came with plenty of ice (which I personally enjoy). Very refreshing, and had just enough bite and alcoholic \"zing!\" for a Sunday evening.   We decided to share a charcuterie platter which was, no doubt, a fantastic idea. The prime selection of meats and cheeses came with spiced and candied nuts, various jams, and mustard. Loved it. Oh, and duh! It came with copious amounts of bread. How could I forget THAT?!   We also shared the endive, apple, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola salad with roasted chicken shreds (+$3). This was a delicious and heaping amount of greens and fruit, and very much needed with all the meats and cheeses we were consuming! And well, did I mention we needed salad to also balance the very decadent mac &amp; cheese? That mac &amp; cheese: I want to just lift that hot plate and put it right onto my face. It consisted of three cheeses: gruyere, cheddar, and parmigiano-reggiano. The bread crumbs on top and the spice of cayenne pepper really made this mac &amp; cheese distinctive from others. Granted, I've had bread crumbs on mac &amp; cheese before, but this was toasted to perfection and the spice cut through the creamy richness of the dish.   The service: solid. The servers were friendly and quite personable. While my friends and I were very much engaged in deep conversations (at one point we were talking about economics... I mean, who does that on a Sunday night?... [We do.]), I noticed how efficient and attentive the service was. I'm glad I was able to experience a meal at Fat Angel. I intend to come back for dinner or perhaps a casual drink on their petite patio out front. Give this spot a try. It's heavenly! (Womp. Womp.)",

Our guy asked us questions on what type of wine we like and made great recommendations on pairing the wine + food.   This place is cozy, so seating can be tight. Nice candlelit ambiance at night.

You can only imagine how excited we were when we were able to grab seats at the bar the other day. What joy! Great service, semi small menu, but full \u00a0of great dishes and reasonable prices.  Bonus - large beer/wine list with a few fun cocktails  Food/Drink highlights...meaning, GET THESE!  *Pimm's Cup...light, refreshing, delicious! *Lemon/sage/caper butter, * Cheese plate (favorites were Vella Dry Jack \u00a0NorCal hard cow, \u00a0Wisconsin semi-soft cow and El Trigal \u00a0Spanish semi-firm sheep) *Organic Firebrand bread (comes with cheese and butter) *Sliders (beef, caramelized onions, bacon, irish cheddar, aioli) - no words can express how tasty these are.   Note - this place is pretty small...so either head there early or expect to wait.   Overall...do yourself a favor and give them a try. Soon!",

The servers are nice, and the wine/draft selection is pretty extensive. Their food menu is limited but that's pretty typical of a wine bar. Although food only takes up 2 pages in the entire menu, what they do serve is fantastic. We had the spicy mac-n-cheese and the smoked salmon salad. Salads are a good size and meant for sharing so that's a lovely starter, they do have several flatbreads that quite a few people ordered but we didn't get to it. If I had to choose one I'd pick the spicy sausage flatbread as that was our servers favorite. The mac-n-cheese was good and it's one of the dishes they're known for.   Overall, the drink selection was great, food was tasty, the restaurant had a great vibe to it that you could show up for a date or be casual with a couple friends, our service was excellent, and the entire experience was reasonably priced. I'm a big fan and I'll definitely be back.",

We got a cheese and meat plate, the apple/Gorgonzola/walnut salad (huge!) and the Mac and cheese (had to). All were great. The salad portion was gigantic (good for 4 people...) and we definitely filled ourselves to the rafters.

I've only tried appetizers / share dishes, which were quite good as well. \u00a0I've yet to try the flatbread pizzas but they always smell and look delicious when I see them ordered at other tables. \u00a0It does seem like it takes a very long time to get warm dishes, such as the pizzas, though. \u00a0  My only complaints about this establishment are that they are constantly overwhelmed both in terms of service and space. \u00a0Service for food items is very slow, and there never seen to be tables free -- even rarely 2 adjacent seats at the bar. \u00a0They wind up with people milling around the bar without a place to sit or stand. \u00a0Not good at all for groups, and a bit of a risk on weekend nights, as you may have to wait a very long time to be seated.",

They've \u00a0got it all, unique beers, wine, and delicious food. Speaking of food, I feel that at this point that I've tried most of the menu and it's all delicious, but the real stand-out is the smoked trout salad. Jesus tap dancing Christ, that smoked trout is the most delicious fish ever. I want to buy a case of that smoked trout and eat it everyday. My fiend described that salad as \"an orgasm you don't have to work for\". It's that good and it's SALAD.  Moving on....  Beer selection is top notch and changes regularly as does the wine but I think they have certain bottles that are always on hand. The decor is pretty cool too, they have a lot of pews from an old church, which adds a naughty element as you indulge in booze and rich food.   My only criticism is that it gets really crowded and it can be hard to get a table as it's not a very large place. They do have some outdoor tables (with heat lamps) but it's nicer inside. They seem a little disorganized when it comes to seating as well, so if you don't want to wait around, I'd suggest coming early. Whatever though, I'd probably wait an hour for that trout salad.   5 stars for the food, the drinks, and the fun I've had here  3 stars for the organization/seating",

Jason and Cyrick are super heroes who somehow remain jolly and attentive (with a super-human knowledge of good food and wine) late into the evening (and dealing with tipsy Asian chicks like me). Cyrick is one of the happiest people around -- and is really knowledgeable about good food/drink pairings on the menu. \u00a0Plus - he \u00a0really knows cured meats.   The food -- the smoked trout salad with fennel and fried capers will turn any raging carnivore into a whipped vegetarian. It is THAT good. The sliders with the garlic aioli and spicy pickles are perfect bits of heaven. The chicken pot pie and mac 'n' cheese are consistently good. The tartufo salami is really tasty.  The wine -- Jason is like Pandora, but for wine. You tell him which wines you like, and he introduces you to new wines that he thinks you might like. He is usually right.   The ambiance -- Fat Angel is soft, romantic and brooding. Girls - the lighting will make you look your most beautiful. \u00a0The music is never too intrusive, and it is easy to have a conversation here.   It's a small place -- so don't go too often.

    "review_text": "Had been wanting to try this spot for awhile now. Located in a nice little nook near Fillmore Street, Fat Angel boasts a great beer menu and some delish gastropub eats.  The wait is long, and they don't take resys, so come early and don't be that hungry. Also, with SF weather, bring either a jacket and sit outside (much shorter wait time, and they have heat lamps), or wait longer for the inside tables. It's a tiny space so waits can me 1.5-2 hours long depending on party size.  We started off with fried capers. These were interesting -- deep fried, so the insides were hollow, and the outsides were crunchy. It was delicious, but super salty (capers, duh).  Next, we noshed on the chocolate cinnamon butter. This was served with a great rye bread, and was so delicious. Like cinnamoney-nutella. Spread like butter, and was soft.  Then we had 2 flatbreads: (1) Roasted red grape, walnut, &amp; prosciutto w/ Gorgonzola, which was lovely. The roasted grapes are a favorite thing of mine that not many places do. It adds a hint of sweet to something that feels savory. It's great. (2) Wild mushroom and white truffle oil w/pecorino. This was also delicious, and better than the roasted red grape flatbread. Both flatbreads were super thin -- think nacho chip with pizza-like toppings. Very tasty and not too heavy.  Then we had the Mac n'cheese - gruyere, cheddar, parmigiano-reggiano, cayenne. Was a nice, homey mac and cheese. The Fa's chicken pot pie - roast chicken, carrots, sherry, tarragon - was also super homey. The toasted filo dough on top was a great touch, which you break into pieces and eat with the insides of the pot pie.  Finally we had a great cheese board, which our server picked. Service overall was nice, with servers being very beer and food knowledgeable, and eager to help.  Had a delightful meal with great friends, and would definitely come back.",

Their bottle selection is more extensive than any fan of craft brew could hope for, and their draft list is always inspired and brimming with something to suit all tastes and moods.   Combing knowledgable beer servers, and a moody and intimate atmosphere, Fat Angel is the sort of place where one pint can quickly turn into four and a casual conversation can grow into a real friendship. It is a place like no other in San Francisco and should not be missed by anyone.",

It's a terrific place for hanging out with friends, or just for a small, intimate get together.  The only thing is that it's getting more and more busy these days. You're better off going earlier in the evening, rather than after 9 or 10. It gets so crowded inside that you can't even move around. I'm happy that they're doing so well, but it does make it difficult to go there for a quiet drink late at night. Oh well, I still love it here! It's definitely our stand-by drinking establishment!!!",

A waiter took our drink orders, and had them waiting at the table for us as soon as it was ready.  I had the sparkling chardonnay blend (REALLY good) and chardonnay on tap (okay)  We split a few things family style - prosciutto flatbread (super delish), maple bacon butter (so-so), sliders (good!), and the waiter encouraged us to split one of the salads - we chose the pear/endive - and it was my favorite item of the night! (REALLY, REALLY tasty).   be sure to double check your bill, after a couple of glasses of wine each, we nearly missed that we had 2x$19/glass of wine on our bill that were not ours. they quickly fixed our bill, but we nearly missed those pricey add-ons.   the service had ups and downs, bartender was great, female waitress was great, expeditor/busser was great, but the male waiter seemed aloof and annoyed.   still, i'd definitely go back, and have a feeling this place will be one of our go-to's for pre-concert drinks!  also, for some reason, looking at the restaurant on the map in the yelp app showed it around the corner from the Fillmore, however when I clicked in the app to have it give me directions via the iphone maps app, it took me a few blocks away. we knew where we were going so rerouted ourselves. but something was a bit wacky with that.",

Sherry, tarragon, carrots &amp; roasted chicken had the consistency of goopey mush. There was a spice that totally turned me off (cumin? coriander? curry?) The pastry top had many flakey layers.  -- mac &amp; cheese, $11: loved the corkscrew pasta &amp; the generous crunchy topping. Cheese wasn't as sharp as I would've liked &amp; too runny.   More misses than hits, so three stars for our dinner is more than generous. Service was impeccable; Jason &amp; Cy are amazing hosts &amp; their establishment is beautiful &amp; archetypal San Francisco. I just don't think their food style matches what I'm looking for.

It's a bit off the beaten path of busy Fillmore but very worth the trek past Popeyes and the Brooklyn's clothing store. The have a very interesting and varied winelist plus really good stuff on tap. Who knew a zin could be so good when poured like a beer? Fat Angel's food shines as well. The meat plate is a little bit of sliced pork heaven and the bread to go with is perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The flatbreads are also delicious and worth the fire time.

I was out with my BF and wanted to take him out to dinner. \u00a0I wanted to try the food at FA but the stuff prevented that from happening.   OMG, confusion and chaos.

Serious mess, matter the fact, the male server said as much, he used the word confused. \u00a0We took 2 seats at the window and the same server questioned why we took those seat. We were standing for nearly 10mins, waiting for someone to smile and greet us but that never happened. As we began to walk out, we then caught the attention of the woman at the bar who asked, how many we said 2, she said take the window. Realizing that getting served was going to take some time, I got up and looked at the wine list on the wall hoping to get a bottle and chill a bit. That didn't happen. I stood reading the menu and was completely ignored. I tried to get the bar tenders attention, it never happened. I sat down, waited a bit more....we then decided to leave.   Both the bar tender and only the server were struggling, communicate was lacking.   Restaurants have off nights, people have bad days. There was no excuse for lack of service. We did not have an expectation of any sort; we didn't complain, or appeared to be entitled. We just wanted to sit down, have dinner and enjoy the evening.

The name threw me off when looking for a spot on Yelp but once we looked into the bar, we need we would love it. The intimate space has a small bar, dim lighting and seating along the far wall and lined across the front windows. There was outdoor seating as well but being San Francisco, it was too cold to sit out there. We scored a random cozy table in the middle of the restaurant. It ended up being a little traffic-y as waiters and customers would have to walk past us to get in and out.  The menu is simple and conducive to sharing. Selections of cured meats, cheeses and breads are the primary items. I was cursing that we had a lackluster meal at Dosa just 30 minutes prior as I wanted to try some of the great cheese choices they had.  My brit husband was in heaven with their beer selection. When the barman brought over the book of beers, his eyes lit up. He ended up getting a craft draft beer which was offered as a 16 or a 22 oz. The wine menu looked good but I wasn't in a vino or beer mood. Upon the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the pimms cup and it was so refreshingly good. There are cute quotes on the menu and I like that they included 'hetchy hetch' priced as free on the drinks side.   The crowd was a mix between girlfriends, first dates and married couples. I like communal/family style meals so the idea of ordering a couple of plates and sharing over some bottles of wine is ideal.  Perfect spot for date night, intimate snack/drink with small group of friends.",

    "review_text": "I figured I should write a more comprehensive review for fat angel considering it's one if my favorite spots. This place is what a gastro pub should be. Great beer and wine selection and delicious consistent food. It is quite small and very popular. \u00a0The combination of small and popular is actually the major drawback of the place. \u00a0They do not take reservations so wait times can be upwards of 1-2 hours at times if you want a table for dinner. \u00a0You can put your name on a list and they will text you when a table becomes available, but this system may not be ideal for some. Also considering that some people order food and then sit at tables for hours drinking after dinner makes it difficult for the staff to accurately predict wait times. \u00a0Also since they have outdoor seating, weather becomes a variable in that on nice days their seating capacity almost doubles. \u00a0  The staff is always very friendly and do their best to accommodate given the limitations listed above. \u00a0They are understandably in a tricky situation and there is no great way to make everyone happy! \u00a0  When you walk in there is a chalkboard that lists the beer and wine on tap. This is an ever changing selection which is great. Occasionally they run out of beers and the selection of tap beer can be limited. They make up for this with a huge selection of bottled beers listed by type in their menu.   Just about everything on the food menu is awesome. My favorites are the maple bacon butter, kale salad with chicken, all of the flat breads, and the sliders. These all seem to pair perfectly with the beer.",

The invites were sent, I was talking up the place and people were excited. \u00a0I arrived before 5:30 on a Friday to snag my two tables. \u00a0When I arrived I spoke with the same guy who informed they had two reservations totaling 35 guests. \u00a0I am expecting an additional 20. \u00a0We tried to make it work at Fat Angel. \u00a0Then it became increasingly more difficult, so I took my party elsewhere. \u00a0Saddened and dismayed this decreased my 2nd experience at Fat Angel. \u00a0  Be up front with your customers about what you can and what you cant do. \u00a0Either you DO take RESERVATIONS or YOU DONT! \u00a0Drinks, food, quaint and adorable space...not good for groups.",

The wine is priced decently, I think a glass goes as low as $8 for one of the Chianti's. I recommend getting the cheese plate, it is priced at $5 each or 5 for $21. Meaning for $21 you get a little plate with some crackers and five different cheeses. Not really a value, but its always nice when you can snack on some cheese over wine.  Not recommended if you are looking for a modern and spacious wine lounge with a group of friends. But great for a glass of wine ad some cheese on a mellow night. I would not recommend it for big groups, as seating is somewhat limited... i.e. finding two seats is one thing, finding six is an entirely different story.",

Grab a drink at the bar while you wait and make sure to bring people that will make good conversation or you can always stand at a table giving dirty looks to hurry up and get going. Anyway back to Fat Angel, great selection of beers and amazing bites. You would definitely have to come here a few times to try all the items on the menu. The menu itself is quite small but you definitely want to try it ALL. For appetizers they offer their flavored butters (yum), cheese and meats (yum yum). They offer salads, flat breads, mac n cheese, sliders ( a must try!!! you will die for the sauce), and chicken pot pie. They also offer items for dessert but the 2 times I dined I was way to stuffed to get to that part of the meal. I will definitely have to leave room next time. Great place for a dinner date or small party. Definitely a place I will have to come and visit when in town. Totally in love with you golden chubby lil winged angel. Till we meet again.",

I had never encountered this combination of flavors before I came here and was shocked they could get such quality food to come out of that small kitchen.   Seriously all four salads are delicious. My personal favorites being the kale salad and the endive salad. Also the portions on the salads are HUGE. They should be shared by two people and shouldn't even be attempted by one person. They aren't expensive and will fill you up. The Flat breads are even better. Every time I look at the menu I want to try something else but I always, always get the roasted red grape and walnut flat bread. It is just so savory and a perfect combination of sweet and salty. I rely on my date to order one of the others so I can at least try it but it is a halfhearted attempt at best.   Another positive is the service time. The turnaround on food is one of the best I have had in the city and the quality is always consistent. Shout out to whoever is back there whipping up the food.  By this time you are completely full and realize you haven't even gotten to the main dishes. I have had the sliders and the mac and cheese which are both great as well. The mac and cheese is very spicy so be forewarned if you aren't used to that.   This place also holds its own as a bar as well. There is a stuff drink menu with plenty of options for the beer aficionados. The wine is pretty varied as well but may not satisfy the wine heads of SF.   The customer service is great at Fat Angel as well. With easy pay at the bar and personally calling you when your table is ready are great perks.   Also full disclosure I am in love with the bartender/waitress.I don't know her name but she has short hair and tattoos and is the woman of my dreams. \u00a0I am sure she is married or taken but I am professing my love for her here.   The negatives that could knock off some stars for others are just how small Fat Angel is. It is a really tiny and intimate place and can get crowded on most nights by around 8 or 9pm. I am talking standing room only at the bar and freezing your butt off by choosing to sit at the outside tables because nothing is available inside. Be prepared for a wait time but its never too long. Also the small place leads to some really really close table set ups. You are in the other couples conversation no matter what so be prepared for people watching as you will be two inches from someone else.   Fat Angel may have an odd name but as one of my first introductions to social life in SF I couldn't have had a better experience. The service has not dipped in the three years I have been in SF and I would venture to say it won't when you make your way out there as well.   Fillmore has a gem that serves a perfect wine and candlelight home with food that leaves you coming back for more. Also if you know the waitress tell her she is awesome and has a fan club. This is the place I suggest whenever dinner is up to me so I am sure I will see you there.",

    "review_text": "When settling in for a relaxing swirl, there are times when I want to be free from decision making. For an establishment that bills itself as a wine bar, there's a surprising lack of flights that would allow for just that. However, the beverge list is broken up into digestible bits: quaff, suds, wines etc that make browsing fun. They work with the cordial and wine license pretty well, offering a few specialty effervescent imbibes and several classics like the Pimm's Cup for happy toasting.  After a few rounds, I could imagine slipping into the gentle ease of the place, noshing on delectable cheeses of which there are a-plenty, and becoming anvil-ed to the church pews on the arm of a fella. I'd certainly go steady with this charming watering hole were I a denizen of the neighborhood.",

We got the mushroom flat bread which was completely divine. The mushrooms were fresh and so fragrant.

You might be surprised that the beer/wine selection takes about 90% of the menu but this is a wine bar after all. However, also come here for the food as it's delicious!  The FLATBREAD PIZZA comes in various styles (Firebrand sourdough baguette and whole grain mustard with chorizo, duck salami, genoa, pheasant terrine, speck, or soppressata, $5-$28) and is worth every penny - most delicious topped sourdough I've had in a while, and super crispy.  The SOURDOUGH &amp; BUTTER ($5) satisfies in a special kinda way - have you tried Philz Cofffee butter or Maple Bacon butter? I bet you haven't. Go order.  Finally, the CHICKEN POT PIE (roast chicken, carrots, sherry, tarragon, $13) was creamy and had a sweet hint to it. Marvelous.  Fat Angel - a pleasant surprise in the lower Fillmore area.

First the owners are awesome, generous with samples makes me wanna buy more! \u00a0You can tell they love what they do ( i used to be in the industry and this is something you can tell! it translates into the whole feel of the place) they are passionate about their hand selected ingredients beer and wine. \u00a0They both have GREAT taste, i dont agree with all their choices but i respect their commitment to their unique style and flavor choices, setting them apart from the other \"run of the mill\" locally owned restaurants in the area. \u00a0The wine list is second to none having varietals that span from the most basic to the rare tasty varietals the distinguished pallet craves!    Food is awesome, hands down always made fresh to order the pot pie is off the chain! the flat beards get all the love but dont forget the mac and cheese and sliders as well!

(Yay I'm joining the bandwagon) I do think it's a bit pricey, the plate is rather small but it is pretty dense so it will fill you up especially if you're not sharing. The sliders ($13) were also really good!! Definitely recommend that. We also got a cheese plate..it's served with bread and jelly.   For drinks, I can only speak for myself. I got the Sauvignon blanc (2013) and it tasted like crap. I couldn't finish it :( and I hate wasting alcohol.  The ambience of this place is casual! Kinda dark inside. The decorations are cool. The bathroom is nice and clean too!! There's even decorations inside. This is a plus for me, somebody who has a small bladder and spends much of their time running to the bathroom. :)  Overall great experience, just pricey. $80+ for 3 people.",

They acted like I was going to dine and dash the entire time. I looked over the menu as I waited for my friends, and in that time almost every obnoxious waiter (especially the pretentious dbag in the jorts who looks like the guy from the mountain goats) Came over to me and asked me what I wanted when it wasn't even busy and said they were going to get busy hinting for me to leave. I was pressured into buying a $20 bottle of mead that was a fair price if they included a free bj along with it. After ordering I asked if I could switch to a bigger table and they laughed and said \"maybe when you're friends get here\" rolling her eyes. Long story short my friends got there we closed the tab and I left her money plus tip which I didn't want to give. (I was a waitress and I have never in my life treated any of my customers so rudely). Then jorts (jean shorts) and waspy hipster girl run after my friends and I claiming that we hadn't paid!

Nail in the coffin.   There was something truly magical and relaxing... and comfortable... about this wine bar and it literally seemed to have that \"something\" that everyone loves. For me, it was everything.",

    "review_text": "One of my favorite spots in the city hands down. To start- the wine! Where else can you find wine ON TAP? That was a first for me. They change their wine and beer selections constantly and have local micro-brews on tap as well. The food is great, the burger sliders and the salads are tasty. The cheeses and meats are superb and very fresh. And you have to try the flavored butter and the flat bread. Everything on the menu is a win for me and the prices are fair. I recommend ordering the food you want then asking which wine would pair with it. The owner is really nice and will give you advice on what to try, and give you samples of the wine if you aren't sure what you want.   The ambiance of this place is very laid back, its fancy but casual and works well for groups or more intimate dates. Inside, the benches are church pues which have been donated, there is a full sized chuch organ, a huge chandalier, and a collection of cork tops above the bar. The outdoor seating is convenient, just wish they had some heaters out there! Besides that, I really can't find anything I'd change. 5 stars!",

We got some great beers--i got a sour something--i know this is awful but i don't remember what it was--my bf ordered it for me. Beers were good but nothing compared to the food--we split everything:  3 cheese for $14 -Truffle Tremor (My favorite--so good!) -Vella Dry Jack \u00a0NorCal hard cow--like a sharper Jack cheese, also very good -Some kind of Gouda--also delicious It came with a nice jam pairing and organic crustinis  GREAT DEAL AND SO DELICIOUS  Mac n' Cheese - gruy\u00e8re, aged cheddar, parmigiano-reggiano \u00a0$11 This was delicious and the breaded topping was great as well! The pasta was a perfect texture too  3 Sliders - beef, caramelized onions, bacon, irish cheddar, aioli \u00a010 Holy Cow these were tender, juicy, and that aoili sauce has crack in it i swear. Was a little sad that it came with 3 sliders and i was with 2 others so I could only eat one....  All in all, a great experience but I would definitely recommend getting there before 630/7 because it got PACKED while we were sitting there.",

Otherwise, the inside is pretty much just like any other crowded, loud bar. \u00a0Upon walking in, it took 7 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us or make eye contact. \u00a0Host walked past us about 4 times with his ipad. \u00a0  Took more standing right by the bar to get someone's attention who then said they needed to check with the host who again ignored us until we jumped in front of him as he walked by the 5th time. \u00a0Finally sit down, takes another couple of minutes for the waitress to get to us, though she was apologetic, which I can appreciate. \u00a0Our order came pretty quickly which was nice. But took us another 10 minutes to get our plates, napkins and knife. \u00a0As good as the cheese was, I still need a knife. \u00a0We had to ask multiple people to get our place settings.  Finally when we're all settled in, trying to enjoy our food and libations, table next to us was just filled with loud obnoxious guys who seemed to want to have all their friends join them at a small 4-person table. \u00a0Their waiter was as eager to participate in this \"bumpin\" night as they were. \u00a0Wondering if he was on something too since he bumped into and stepped on my foot a few times while trying to take their order. \u00a0No apologies.  We were very eager to leave. \u00a0If you find yourself here, do yourself a favor and stay outside. \u00a02 stars for their indoor experience, and 4 for their outdoor experience.",

    "review_text": "This place is fantastic. Came here randomly a few weeks ago. A friend and I had been searching for another wine bar, but when we couldn't find it, we stumbled upon this one instead. The selection of beers was very impressive, but what caught my eye - and captured my heart - was the fact they have WINE ON TAP. Let me repeat that again.. Fat Angel has WINE ON TAP. I thought draft wine only existed in my version of heaven.  Anyway, we had to wait quite a long time to be seated, which is perhaps the only downside. It was a Wednesday night. It was around 8. And it was packed. Just elbowing our way to the bar to put our names on the waiting list was tricky. We must have been lucky to arrive at exactly the same time as everyone else, because by the time we were seated (well over an hour later) it was no longer so crowded. But they have WINE ON TAP, so I was content. As for the food, we ordered the 3 cheese plate, the chorizo meat plate, the asparagus flatbread and the sliders. Being generally gluten free, I passed on the breads that arrived with our cheeses and meat, and the kitchen was (kindly) able to serve my sliders with lettuce instead of buns. Everything I ate was super tasty, and my friend enjoyed his flatbread too.  Just about everything here was fab; the decor was fun, the bar staff friendly, the servers attentive, the food yummy, the drinks flowing. I just would have liked to not have had such a long wait. Especially on a weekday (we didn't leave until almost 11:30). But you can't knock a place for being popular, especially when it's this good.",

    "review_text": "Word of the Meal: CRAMPED  So the Mister and I, being from Los Angeles, are becoming more conscious about our caloric intake, health and fitness. In addition to regular exercise and healthy eating, we recently cut out processed carbs and unnecessary sugars after 6pm. One day, I just couldn't take it anymore. So, we went to Fat Angel since it was two blocks away. It was packed on a cold, dreary night. Nobody appeared to be hosting or seating people, so I made my way to an empty table and sat down. Not knowing if this was acceptable behavior at Fat Angel, I kind of went with it and went to town with the carbs. LOL.  We had the Pimm's cup and the Champagne cocktail for drinks. Neither of which were to die for. We then ordered the mac-n-cheese, chicken pot pie and sliders. The sliders had a good cook on them and were tasty. The chicken pot pie was yummy, but there wasn't enough crust and therefore, too much filling. The filling, however, did have a good amount of shredded chicken which I was glad they didn't skimp on. The mac-n-cheese was okay. It was served in a hot skillet which made scooping and serving the dish a bit difficult (there was no pan holder or hot glove to help in handling it). The Mister didn't take to the mac-n-cheese and said he could have made it himself. Although a fair assessment as far as difficulty of the dish, the Mister rarely cooks...yeah, go figure! Kettle meet pot.   The service at Fat Angel was good, but the envirnoment was too cramped for our style. Other table's conversations were bleeding into ours, coercing silence. I did get what I was in search of - a few mouth fulls of starchy carbs, but I do not think I would go back again. A gastropub probably isn't my cup of tea, but I am sure others had a wonderful time at this neighborhood joint.",

We had some last minute changes during our SF getaway and wanted some delicious food in our bellies :)  We got lucky with parking and quickly found our way to the quaint little pub. About a 10 minute wait and had a look at the menu even though we already knew what we were going to have. Unfortunately, we were seated on a two-top with 3 people, but moved after a few dishes came out when the table next to us left.   Polenta fries with garlic aioli and spicy ketchup: So bomb! Fried to perfection. The garlic aioli was nice and creamy and the ketchup had just the right kick. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fat-angel-san-francisco?select=v9nx_p9ngsUFMTeRQL3_2Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fat-\u2026</a>  Salame nostrano and hot copa (??): Originally ordered just the salame but because the \"order took so long\" (I didn't think it was too long of a wait o_O) one of the owners gave us the other meat on the house! Don't remember if it was the hot copa or not, but it was delicioso~ The meats come with whole grain mustard and bread. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fat-angel-san-francisco?select=u_QTAXoXAyNA2PmWqzwApw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fat-\u2026</a>  Red grape, gorgonzola, walnut, proscuitto flatbread: The right size for the three of us.

It's fairly close, and you only have to walk about 5 minutes to get to Kabuki.   We walked in and the friendly cashier girl motioned to some tables, but we opted for the bar so we could see their different pours.   Now, the ambiance of this place is like the livingroom of a cozy cabin, deer head and all! I really liked it, and the patrons kept their voices at a minimal tone, even at an establishment that wasn't a speakeasy AND had alcohol! Amazing! The beer list is awesome. Actually the whole damn beer \u00a0and wine list is awesome. I mean if I had the tolerance of a Dartmouth frat boy (eeee) I would have tried a whole bunch of other shizz. However, Sundays are my hangover GTFOOMF days, so I opted for the Hef they had on tap, and the BF had some Retribution? Refraction? Redemption?...some apocalyptic sounding beer. Those were great!  For food, we had the mushroom truffle flatbread, which contributes to me docking down a star. For the life of me, I could NOT make out any truffle. If you slap the word truffle on it, I expect to ... at least smell it, if not taste it. \u00a0The warm pretzel was really amaze though (MORE MUSTARD THO), and perfect beer food.   Overall, it's a great place to grab a bite and sit and chit chat before/after a movie at the Kabuki. I will definitely be back.",

The ratio of filling and crust was perfect for me [[ Flatbread with mushroom &amp; white truffle oil ]] - thin and crispy crust - fresh and light, not greasy [[ Mac n' Cheese ]] - 3 different types of cheese, nice little crusty bits throughout. \u00a0  My only complaint would be that it gets way too crowded here, even early on a weekday. \u00a0Anybody want to join me for early mid-afternoon drinking?",

The server was super nice and very informative about the massive wine and beer list. I went with a dry-hopped cider and the girls had a champagne cocktail and a couple of the reds. We loved the selection of charcuterie and pate, served with grained mustard and copious amounts of bread, but let's face it, we came for the flavored butters. We had a hard time deciding which one to try and ended up with the lemon caper sage butter, which was delish! We also got the mac &amp; cheese, which was very good but a bit spicy for me. I couldn't leave without trying the apple bread pudding (I can't leave anywhere that has bread pudding without trying the bread pudding), and it was absolutely amazing! I'm a bit of a bread pudding snob, and this was among the best bread puddings I've ever eaten. And it was HUGE! In fact, all of the portions were huge.

The place is fairly small, so when we showed up around 7:30pm on a weekday, we were made to wait about 20 minutes. Not a problem as we ordered a drink at the bar, and stood outside, away from the crowds and in the fresh air.  When we were seated, we were thanked for our patience, and ordered: +Mac 'n' cheese ($11): with gruy\u00e8re, aged cheddar, parmigiano-reggiano, it was incredibly good. My date raised his eyebrows at me as I scooped out every last bit of it. No shame in my game. +Meat and cheese plate: we opted for three of the cow cheeses ($5 each, 3 for $14, 6 for $27) and three of the meats: salametto, hot coppa, and Calabrese ($5.25 each, 3 for $15, or 6 for $28). It was served with a sourdough baguette, some fig, grain mustard, and various chutneys. Delicious!

They were more than happy to let me sample a few (much appreciated). I chose a tasty pinot and the date opted for a hoppy IPA.  Super pleased with the service. A satisfactory meal for about $50?

I think Fat Angel might have been my first SF gastropub foray. I wasn't disappointed!  I came here for pre-show dining before seeing Shabazz Palaces at Yoshi's SF. If you're going to Yoshi's for music, I highly recommend you come here instead of dining at Yoshi's; Yoshi's is overpriced and doesn't taste very good. Fat Angel was only a couple blocks away from the venue.  The wait is a little long, and since the establishment is pretty small, I had to wait outside. There is some bar seating, but I opted for the tables instead. The atmosphere was sexy yet understated, and the noise level was at a comfortable middle between awkward low and overbearing high.  What we had:  Maple bacon butter: As a self-proclaimed butter aficionado, I approve this dish! It reminded me of a buttery reincarnation of Frances' Bacon Beignets. When I ran out of bread, I started eating the butter on its own; NO REGRETS.  Mac n' cheese: I'm not a huge fan of mac n cheese, but since my boyfriend seems to be stuck in fourth grade, we gave it a try. It was AMAZING! They used conchiglie rigate (or what I always refer to affectionately as the \"shell pasta\", and the dish was served on a cast iron mini-casserole. Yum!  Chicken pot pie: Not as great as the mac n cheese, I'm afraid, but memorable in its own right. If you have never broke the shell on a steaming hot pie with the back of your spoon, you are missing out.  I'll be back for you, Fat Angel.",

The food is usually good. We actually enjoyed the first two items we ordered tonight. We were even willing to overlook the burnt mushroom flatbread due to our experiences in the past until the \"manager\" treated us as if we were pandhandling for free food when we informed her that this dish was not of the quality we expected.   \"It's wierd that you would eat all of it if you didn't like it!\" she mocked as she N0T so gently stacked the dishes and grabbed our forks and knives off the table without our permission. \u00a0As a matter of fact, a knife fell off the plate and almost hit my friend. \u00a0The waitress who also claims to be the manager did not seem to notice that and did not bother to apologize. \u00a0She also did not notice that we only ate half of the flatbread. \u00a0The truth is we only ate that first half because we were starving after having to wait for over 30 minutes for it to come out even after reminding three people and didn't want to complain. \u00a0It was after we each finished the first piece and tried a bite of the second piece that we realized that it was too dry and overcooked to for us to pretend to enjoy.  When she left the table, my co-workers and I asked each other if this just really happened to us? \u00a0Some of us have been going to Fat Angel for years and thinks highly of the establishment and owner. We were quite taken by the attitude of this employee. \u00a0She actually returned to our table with the bill and said that she could hear us and that she has taken the flatbread off our bill eventhough once again \u00cft's wierd that we ate it if we didn't like it!\" One of my friends who is a regular there stayed surprisingly calm and stated that we didn't want her to do that, we just wanted to let her know.\" She interuppted and replied \"Yeah, you did. Why would you eat something you didn't like? \u00a0So I took it off.\" As a working professional who works hard for my money and my lifestyle, I was absolutely uphauled! \u00a0I have never been so insulted. \u00a0We walked away feeling less than pleased! \u00a0I would probably not return to Fat Angel for a while; not as long as they keep employees, let alone \"\"managers\" who treat customers that way.

Not too salty (which is often a boon to pot pies) and not too heavy. :) I'm a fan.   We weren't shy about grilling the waitress (out of our ignorance) about the meat options for the chatrucerie board of meats. Do you know what this means?  I actually don't remember what they were anymore, but we went with the Duck Mousse, Hot Copa (pork butt), and one of them that was wild boar..because...boar is awesome! \u00a0The meats came out in layered rows, served up with Firebrand sourdough baguette slices and whole grain mustard on a wooden board.

The mousse was ok, bread pudding was more like a cinnamon roll or thick french toast and good. The fact that they have a large beer selection, dessert wines, and a large wine menu for a bar is a definite plus. The decor is hip, love the diverse crowd, it was getting busy when we left at 6pm on a Sunday. Can't wait to return. Hope to see more spots like this in the Fillmore.

They have an excellent list of great wines, many of them are wines that you will probably never heard of and giving your taste buds a good tingle. \u00a0The food there albeit very limited is solid and accommodate with the wines that you might order. \u00a0The Chicken Pot Pie and the Apple Bread Pudding is to die for.  The owners of Fat Angel (the one I know better is Cyrick) \u00a0will take good care of you and understand what you will like to drink and they will remember you. \u00a0I didn't go there for two weeks and the owner who I order from only once remember me, \u00a0I was thoroughly impressed. \u00a0Now this place has now become my hangout place for wine. \u00a0  So if you are in the Fillmore area for date or a quick drink. This is the place to go!",

I love that they have wine on tap, though I sometimes wish they had a better wine-by-the-glass selection (well, I think the main issue is their selection is \u00a0just not really my taste, and I think they could do a good job of bringing in some small production stuff from the central coast, etc, that larger restaurants and bars can't carry due to production limits).  My main beef is just that it's always totally crowded and there is no clear system of organization to get a table, and you can't tell who works there and who doesn't. It's enjoyable if you can swing by on a day when you can instantly get a table and enjoy yourself with some friends.",

My last two trips to San Francisco have really highlighted the lack of beer selection at the bars, pubs, restaurants, etc. Which I find SO hard to believe! This place is surrounded by incredible breweries (Lagunitas, Bear Republic, Moylan's, Russian River, Mendocino, etc). Are they shipping all their beer to us lucky ducks in Portland who already have an incredible beer scene??? Well I guess... Thank you! But I still want to find good beer in San Francisco.  Thank you Fat Angel for providing me with my first great pint in the city. Fat Angel has 9 Beers on Tap, which vary from local and east coast breweries to beers from Belgium. They also have an elaborate bottled selection. The layout is a bit cozy when sitting at the dining room tables. I always prefer the bar, but they also have some lower bar seating thats right in front of their front window, which opens nicely to beautiful weather. Bartendars were Great and knowledgable. My friend and I decided to order the Wild Mushroom &amp; White Truffle Oil w/pecorino flatbread which was discounted for Happy Hour and it was SO Good! Very thin crust and the mushrooms were incredible! If the rest of the food is as good as the flatbread, I gotta get back and try more of this menu!   Thank you Fat Angel!",

That said though, I don't know if I would come back if it wasn't 5 minutes from my house. \u00a0I ordered the fried capers and smoked trout salad. \u00a0BLAH. \u00a0The fish didn't taste right, the capers for some reason had an oddly fishy taste. \u00a0I tried the pot pie; I wasn't that impressed but then again, it was my first pot pie so maybe I just don't like that dish.  Another blah point is the decor. \u00a0Not a fan - the place isn't cozy, the ambiance feels off and the fixtures (molding, the corners) just doesn't look complete. \u00a0The lighting/coloring just isn't pleasant as well. \u00a0  Anyways, as it's close by and reasonable, I'll head back in the next month to try this place again and re-review if necessary.",

I always ask either Cy or Jen for a recommendation and it's always spot on. Btw, Cy and Jen are awesome. Good people and great service. The food menu is short but you won't be disappointed with any dish you order. That's guaransheed for all my Rasheed Wallace fans out there. The atmosphere is beautiful. The owners purchased architectural components that previously belonged to a church - notice the organ above the bar, wooden benches along the walls, and golden \"fat angel\" hanging outside the front. If you're looking for a venue for a date, or low key dinner before going out, or a drink after work, look no further. Rumor has it the owners are looking to open a larger restaurant a half block around the corner on Fillmore. Hope it comes through, they're turning the Fillmore into one of the most desired neighborhoods to live in SF  My favorites on the food menu: Chicken pot pie Chicken caesar salad (comes with fried capers which are delicious and shredded roasted chicken) Sliders (best you'll ever have, trust me)",

Ambiance was magical with their candlelight lighting and delicious aromas from the kitchen.  The spot is quite small with a narrow bar section and closely-arranged tables for diners. This would be a perfect spot for date night or a toned-down girls night with friends.   I do want to give a HUGE 5 stars to the bartender and (seemingly) host who's name is Derek. He's an absolute top-notch bartender here focused on providing high-quality service to ALL customers. He really helped me find the beer that I wanted by letting me taste beer after beer on their tap list--props to you good sir! I also work in the hospitality industry, so I KNOW A GREAT BARTENDER/SERVER when I interact with one.  I'd love to come here for the food next time, and considering the incredible service my friends and I had with Derek, there will be a round 2.",

I could see it as sort of a datey spot. We were there on a Monday night, but I get the feeling it gets pretty busy on other nights. Its sort of a diamond in the rough of the Filmore.  I liked it, but I didn't love it. I got the zin on tap- I was definitely impressed with the quality of wine on tap... I didn't even know wine could be on tap!  we got the chili garlic butter- and then a couple of salads and a pot pie. This place is definitely an order and share things type of place. But our waitress was a little weird and spacey and didn't really give us any sort of low down. The food was ok- I think my friends pot pie was the winner- I had some extreme order envy with my comparatively lame caesar salad.  We decided that we will have to come back and indulge on cheese and butter variations. In general I wasn't super impressed with this place- a little expensive for what it has to offer.",

The staff let us know we were welcome and that they could accommodate our group - a respectful group who in 90- minutes was headed to Yoshi's for a 7 o'clock comedy show. All orders were placed with the wait staff within five minutes of one another. During the next 90 minutes, half of our party was served and had finished eating two highly explosively spiced mac and cheeses, with no menu warning) the other three Mac and cheese dinners showed up equally explosive an hour later, when it was past time to be leaving for Yoshi's. Salads arrived to no one in particular- that was left for us to sort out. Among the original order we placed \u00a0five plates of sliders. Four arrived during the last15 minutes and the \"no onions\" order arrived with five minutes to spare.  In courteous frustration, mid meal time, I did speak up to wait staff to explain that our aim of dining out together was missing the mark, as five of us were finished, and four had not yet seen any plates of food at all.   A gentleman arrived, and addressed our table and apologized for our missed meals due to the fact that they were working with just one chef. It occurred to us all simultaneously that warning us of lack of cooks when we walked in the door would had honored our time, money, and the joy of sharing food with friends and family - something The Fat Angel Staff staff does not consider of value.  For our trouble, they comped one drink and one order of sliders which I passed around the table - time being what it was. TFC hardly made a a genuine attempt to compensate for five half- eaten meals and the lost patronage from a group of people who appreciate inventive, tasty, food served properly",

The list of craft beers, both bottled and on tap, is phenomenal. Being an avid IPA drinker, I was blown away by the IPA selection here -- ordering three different IPAs and loving each one. I can't wait to try all of the beers here; challenge accepted.  The food is definitely better than your average gastropub, but nothing amazing.  -------------------- FOOD:  Flatbread w/ Mushroom &amp; Truffle Oil: This is a dish that's excellent upon first bite, but gets progressively worse as time cools the cheese. I mean, you can't really go wrong with mushroom and truffle oil on anything, so the taste was definitely there. When the cheese hardens, however, it just tastes stale. Sidenote: I spread some duck liver mousse on it and it was incredible.  Pretzel: It was okay. I wish there was another sauce than mustard.  Cheese Plate w/ Duck Liver Mousse: The duck liver mousse was excellent. When spread upon the bread (or the flatbread), it gave me a faint glimpse of what I loved most about foie gras before the ban.   --------------------  Fat Angel is an excellent joint for beer enthusiasts. If you love craft beers, then you really can't go wrong with this place. Even if you're a craft beer newbie, the knowledgeable and friendly bartenders here will lead you in the right direction. If you're not a beer lover and you're looking for excellent gastropub fare, you may be disappointed.",

Would've expected some insane wait time, \u00a0but the staff was super friendly and we got a drink while we waited.  Positives: Food was AWESOME, get the chicken pot pie. It'll fill you up and tastes amazing! Aside from that, all their little meat and cheese dishes are fabulously paired with jams and mustard to provide an incredible tasting meal. Ask the waiter for his/her opinion, and just trust them if you can't figure out what you want. Staff is super friendly, one of those small businesses where every customer is precious to them, and it shows. Atmosphere is romantic, great for a date.  Con: It's a bit small. There's something like space for 20-25 people, and the place can get a little cramped. But really... being a small cozy romantic restaurant can be a nice change of pace. Not going to take away a star just because their business is so good that it's a little hard to move around. Just know that it's going to be a little cramped if you go on a busy night.",

Advice: don't come here if you have anywhere to be, because 1. the wait takes forever and 2. you'll want to stay and appreciate the drinks, food and atmosphere for as long as possible.  We put our name on the list and a seat at the end of the bar opened up, so I sat and my boyfriend stood next to me at the corner end of the bar to wait it out. The bartenders are super friendly and helpful. They knew everything about every beer they had. It was kind of overwhelming just how many there are. Sounds like the rotate them out regularly. Also, the menu is printed daily, which leads me to believe the menu is also rotated, but based on previous reviews, it looks like they have some signatures.   So, we decided to order at the bar. TRY THE SLIDERS. Literally best mini burger I've ever had. If there's even a chance you might not want to share, just add the extras for $3. Also tried the bacon butter (it was ok, my date loved it) and the capers (perfect alternative to mixed nuts on the bar). I MUST come back to try some of the charcuterie and every single one of the salads. We just didn't have time this time around!  Right as we were paying the bill, they called out name to be seated. They had said 25 minutes or less, which was obviously an optimistic guess, but it was ok because I was glad we got to eat there and weren't late for the show!",

Since I've recently become a developing bourbon connoisseur, now whenever I think of angels and a gastropub, I think of \"angel's share\" which is a term that describes the evaporated liquid of processing bourbon in a barrel (before it's ultimately bottled after however long it stays in a barrel). Because of this knowledge, I thought this might be a bourbon joint. It's actually a wine bar.  This is a small joint that doesn't get crowded right away, but usually does about an hour and a half into the restaurants opening. So, if you can't get a table at State Bird Provisions around the corner, this is an alternative for some people who want to eat ASAP.  The macaroni and cheese is amazing. The crumbs on top make the dish 3 times better. This is the only dish of food I tried. The other dishes on the menu sounded amazing though.  The drinks are expensive so don't binge here (a beer might cost you $10). I ordered this one sour bourbon beer and it clearly said it was $8 on the chalkboard but the bartender charged me $10. He fixed it for me but it's always annoying when that happens.  Overall, nice place to grab a drink before heading off to do something else on Fillmore.",

The bar stools were made from old tractor seats, so they are heavy duty metal. They look really cool. The bar is marble and there is an awesome chandelier hanging over it. Additionally, there is a super cool moosehead on the wall too. Hunting cabin chic.  They have wine and beer on tap, in addition to many bottles of each. They don't appear to have liquor, although they had a Lillet cocktail (is Lillet a liquor?). We opted for a half bottle of the Cab Sauv on tap, which came it what looked like an old soda bottle. All the water bottles are reused wine bottles too--I love the green-ness!  Wine was so good we ordered another bottle! And they have delicious munchies too!  We ordered the mushroom flatbread with truffle oil and parmesan (I think it was parm...). SO good. We also ordered a cheese plate--$5 for one cheese and it comes with bread slices, honey/jam, and these salty-sweet nuts. Food was prompt and yummy. Too bad I wasn't more hungry--they had some amazing other dishes: other flatbreads, mac and cheese, and pot pie!  We got there around 5 and it was empty, but filled up quick! It was packed by 6:30.

Anyway, I had the Brontide, which is a smokey dark saison that was very well balanced and generally wonderful. \u00a0Also their big pretzel is a classic to accompany anything. \u00a0Will definitely be back.",

    "review_text": "YUM YUM YUM! I just moved to San Francisco this past weekend and Fat Angle is probably one of my favorite places to eat thus far! Located just across the street from my apartment it is very convenient for me to eat there.  They have a great selection of beer! Organized by type, some of these bottles can get quite pricey $30+ so be careful when ordering. But if you like beer they are sure to have something you like!  The food is delicious! \u00a0They have a small menu, so in the few times I've been I have been able to try a majority of the items:  Flavored Butters, Cheese, and Meats served with bread -- Almost like a charcuterie platter. It all comes out together on a platter served with bread. I loved the meats and cheeses. Awesome quality and the saltiness goes well when drinking.  Chicken Pot Pie - Delicious! A bowl filled with creamy chicken and veggies (carrots and peas) topped with a crispy crust. Not too doughy since the crust isn't completely surrounding the pie.  Burger Sliders -- My favorite thing here! Juicy meat with some amazing aioli. Also goes great with the pickled jalapenos which are served on the side.  Mac n' Cheese - Cheesy with a kick. The heat seems to linger for awhile, but it is so good.  Flat Breads - Extremely thin crust! Thin and crispy!  Great place to grab some beers and delicious food. My only complaint is that the restaurant is really small, so sometimes the wait can be long.",

    "review_text": "W(h)ine after work (clever happy hour ploy) is perfect at Fat Angel! Not a huge venue, but its coziness and warmth adds charm to this wine bar in the Western Addition. Their happy hour specials are decent--$1 off draft wines and draft beers and $2 off flatbreads.   Never having tried wine on draft, my companion and I ordered a draft cabernet and a pinot noir, respectively. We both enjoyed them...enough to order another. In addition, we ordered the mac 'n cheese and the wild mushroom and white truffle oil with pecorino cheese flat bread. The mac 'n cheese, while was delicious, both admitted to having had better, as theirs lacked a richness. The flatbread was just the right amount of crispness, and ingredients were fresh and very present. I'd definitely order that again.   Staff was friendly and attentive; coming by our table just the right amount of times where we didn't feel neglected nor annoyed. Wine list was extensive (by the glass and bottle), as was the beer list. Prices were moderate; glasses ranging from $8 (whites) - $13. Ambiance is chill and relaxing; perfect for catching up with a friend, a romantic date (lighting is dim), or group outing (though again, the venue isn't huge).   I'm a fan, and I'll likely go again as I enjoyed the wine and food, ambiance and service. Great addition to the Western Addition!",

In July of 2010, I stumbled into this bar with 90 minutes to spare prior to series of spa treatment appointments at Kabuki. I went in for a glass of wine and peace of mind. The day was cray and I was the hottest of messes! I should also add that it was 3pm in the afternoon, July 1st and as a social worker I had spent the entire day in the TL...and I looked like I did too! So I walk in, looking like a vagrant. I'm Black in a rapidly gentrifying area. \u00a0And I was already livid at the effort it took to get a cab to the area (As cabbies saw me, perhaps thinking I was a junkie, or money less scammer and would pass me by) So I'm thinking...there is no way I'm going to get great service, as...well....our White brothers and sisters see what the choose to see sometimes.....and often it lacks accuracy or the whole story...  However, I walked in with all the disheveled entitlement of a bag lady needing a drank...and got superb service from the chick bartender(who herself disclosed an interest psych/social welfare)...tried an amazing Red wine from Argentina, and had land meat for the first time in 4+ yrs when the Free range Sliders were explained as one of their choice dishes (my digestive track is still pissed about it however). I started coming here monthly.  I love this place....there can be some hipster attitude, but is usually minimum at best.   I took my partner last night and we sit down to a meal and spend 90 bucks.....but totally worth it... The trout salad and fried polenta is to die for....I have spent hours here just trying the ales.... Keep up the great work Fat Angel...and thanx for always treating me well; Doo Rag, or 'Hair Did'!!",

    "review_text": "This heavenly bo\u00eete tucked away in the Fillmore Center is a recent discovery, having been recommended by a foodie friend of mine who loves FA's mac &amp; cheese. \u00a0Yummy! \u00a0For me, what stands out about FA's mac &amp; cheese is that it's made with Gruy\u00e8re, topped with toasted bread crumbs and comes out sizzling in a cast iron casserole. \u00a0The portion is large enough for two, so one can try other things on their limited menu. \u00a0I was in a group of 4 in my first visit and along with the mac &amp; cheese, we had their sliders, flat bread and a nice bottle of reasonably priced red wine. \u00a0All of us had a wonderful time! \u00a0On a return visit with a friend, we sat at the bar had very good wine from the tap and shared FA's chicken pot pie and a fris\u00e9e salad. \u00a0The salad could easily have fed 4. \u00a0The pot pie portion was huge, too, but both of us agreed that it was too heavy. \u00a0It's more in the style of a shepherd's pie--too thick and potatoey. \u00a0I much prefer a creamier pie that one can spike with a shot of sherry. \u00a0The Big Four still ranks as my personal favorite for pot pie.  The Fat Angel, having just celebrated their first anniversary, attracts an attractive, young, hip crowd probably more into FA's very good beer list than their wines. \u00a0I find the decor very attactive--done up with the fixtures of an old church. \u00a0Organ pipes line the wall behind the bar and pews serve as banquettes. \u00a0Sit long enough at the bar with a few glasses of wine and one can easily think of Christine Daa\u00e9 being serenaded by the Phantom!",

    "review_text": "Second time here and it's still great. Definitely a small place for a small group of people. The focus here is mostly on the libations part... Obviously from the name :) The food is pretty good though (just a bit on the expensive side for what you get). Even though it is pricey, it's worth it to get a couple of the small plates (especially the meats and cheeses) since it pairs really well with the drinks. Also, keep in mind, the menu changes every now and then, so it's kind of a different experience (at least from the two times I've been there).  They have a bunch of beers on tap and a vast selection of wine and bottled beer. They have everything from cheap to like... almost $72 for a bottle of beer (didn't really pay attention to the wines because we weren't really there for wine). The second time I've went here, we had just gotten out of a very beery brunch at 21st Amendment, so we didn't really order much alcohol; only Drake's 2013 Jolly Rodger Imperial American Black Ale (how awesome is that name). It was the last bottle though... but damn that was good. Highly recommend it... if you can find it somewhere else XD  We ordered the lemon caper sage butter (maple bacon is better), sliders (meh), mac and cheese (yum!), and a meat plate with salchichon, two slices of duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 ('cause we're so fancy), speck, duck salami, and truffled wild boar. The meat plate was definitely better this time around (don't remember the last one we had), and you get a brown bag filled to the brim with bread (which is crazy yummy). The meat plate also comes with a great mustard which brings it all together. Would definitely avoid the sliders though... came out a little soggy... and honestly not very unique/flavorful. The mac and cheese comes in a tiny little cast iron with these awesome breadcrumbs on top.  I like this place for the random selection and the chill atmosphere. Luckily the second time we went, it was waaaaaaaaaaay quieter (we were the only ones in the resturant, minus some of the tables outside) and it was great to hang out with a couple friends. It did start to fill up a little bit by 6 pm (halfish full) but by then we were pretty sated and happy.  Would come back, would recommend, but really the attraction here is the drink! The staff is super friendly too. Definitely has hipster written all over it :D",

The flatbread had great flavor and the ingredients married perfectly; the only suggestion that I would make would be use a focaccia or actual pizza dough instead of the almost cracker like \"flat bread\". We also enjoyed the salad.   The place was rather crowded and it took us around 45 minutes before we got a table. They really need to put some heat lamps outside and maybe a happy hour menu.

The BF and I had just got done biking the golden gate bridge... and we were craving some good food and drinks... put back on those calories we had just pedaled away.   Of course SF was freeeeezing! But as soon as we got inside - we were warmed up! Not too hot, just perfect! We got lucky! The house was full - but a minute after we arrived a couple had just left so we scored some good seats!  I started off with the Riesling. A nice light fruity crisp wine. Yummy yummy. After 2 glasses I was definitely feeling warmer!  We ordered the Firebrand sourdough baguettes with cheese &amp; meat. The platter came with spicy mustard, some fancy smancy jellies and sauces, and nuts. The server was so nice! I had no idea about the types of meats - I don't normally eat this type of food. But I'll definitely start! He gave us a break down of each type of meat, how it was seasoned and processed!   We went with: CHEESE:  Vella Dry Jack \u00a0 hard cow Roaring Forties Blue \u00a0 semi-soft cow  MEAT: Salami Hot Copa  AND on top of that! The server felt bad because our plate was accidentally given to someone else (we didn't even feel the wait was that long). SO he hooked us up with another cheese and meat on the house!  Chorizo Truffle Tremor \u00a0soft goat  The Vella Dry Jack was my favorite! It was dry, but in a good way! The truffle tremor was good too! A bit strong, but very tasty! Especially paired with the yummy sauces \u00a0and the spices in the meats! I loved all the meat! It felt like so much food! But we ate pretty much all of it!  I was planning on this being a starter, but I was so full! We ordered the chicken pot pie as our main entree - and as soon as we got the dish I had to make room for it. A different take on the traditional dish. It was served in a bowl - so it had the appearance of soup - with a square shaped crust placed on top. But with a nice surprise! As you eat the dish - you will find more crust on the bottom and sides of the bowl! The crust is my favorite part, so I was happy! Yummy chicken - thick soups full of veggies, carrots, sherry, &amp; tarragon.  Once we were absolutely full we hung out. Finished our drinks. It was really nice. The setting was perfect! I wouldn't have wanted to spend my last night any other way. I wish we had one of these places in Hawaii. Great for intimate settings - or just to hang out and catch up with the friends. Warm, cozy, clean, nicely decorated. Part of the drop ceiling had beautiful copper tiles with chandeliers hanging from it. There were lots of different types of lighting,  chandeliers, candles, track lighting: the combo of all of them spot on!  I'll admit the drinks were a bit pricey. But not too bad &amp; the experience I had made it all worth it.   I definitely recommend it!",

Duck salami, smoked trout salad, and their butter selection is ah-mazing! Try the garlic chili one - yum!! And they are not stingy about the bread they give you with the butter - so good!",

Had assorted charcuterie and cheese selections and they were good- but the only problem was they didn't bring what we actually ordered. We ate for a few mins then asked the waitress which of the 3 meats was which and then she realized the mistake. The same thing happened to the table next to us w/ their cheeses and another table as well. The flatbread we had ordered came out much later than we had hoped- we almost forgot about ordering it. It was good though.  Not a big deal, but worth noting that they have some minor kinks to work out.",

Instead, times like Sunday at 7 or Tuesday at 6 are times that match the relaxation of ordering butter, bread and wine. In the way the inside decor gives you a reprieve from the city design disaster that is the Fillmore Center, bread, butter and wine should come in a relaxed environment, not when you're fighting for tables. We accomplished a feat that seems as likely as not asking the server to take a photo immediately because of it: 10 of us gathered tables and enough chairs outside to all sit here. I'm not into the S&amp;M of SF's competitive seating scene, but I am way into a GSM with garlic chili butter on a calm night in a special place like Fat Angel.",

Love the food - try the flatbreads, fancy mac n cheese, and the olives - all varying levels of bad for you but oh-so-addictive. \u00a0  Only a couple gripes with this place - the location is a bit sketchy and the food menu, although pretty tasty, is short and never changes.",

No-pressure service, unhurried conversation and relatively little street noise to interrupt the evening. \u00a0I left impressed, only $-2-0 lighter, without having a chance to try their unique craft/belgian beer menu...I will be back for sure :)  A little reluctant to write this review, and reveal my new secret find ;)",

They're categorized and organized in a way that will appeal to anyone - yeasty, hoppy, bitter, sour, reserves, etc. They also have wines on draft, and their draft beers rotate too. It's definitely a little pricey, but the ambiance is great. Sit and chill on a nice day with your friends while eating their fantastic mac n'cheese or polenta fries (both are amazing; you'll thank me later). Oh, and they play The Gaslight Anthem, The Decemberists, and Death Cab. Fantastic music selection. I do wish it were less pricey, and that there were more than just one unisex restroom.",

We pretty much tried everything. \u00a0Champagne cocktail for $10 was delicious. Half-bottle of wine for $20 netted 3 full glasses. Also tried truffled cheese, truffled wild boar salami, spicy salami, hard cow cheese, humboldt's fog goat cheese , and duck liver mousse(my fave). \u00a0  Maple bacon butter was delicious. they had about 5 other variations of butter to try too. Whipped and light. It almost doesn't feel like you're ingesting a million calories!  Endless bags of bread slices and baguette slices. \u00a0We were 80% full based on the charcuterie platter we made ourselves.   Kale salad was also delicious, as well as the mac &amp; cheese (could have been spicier). Sliders were good too - the bread was a softer, more croissant-like bun with sesame seeds.   Would come back again but maybe try an additional butter and not do the mac &amp; cheese. It was good but nothing special.",
