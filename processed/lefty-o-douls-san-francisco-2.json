I'm from LA so I reference Cole's P.E. Buffet (before it turned trendy) and Clifton's Cafeteria (before it turns trendy) and minus all the kitschy tapioca and carrot salads.  But nonetheless, this place is always full of down-home sports fans, down-on-their-luckers, old-timers, habitual stinkers, friendly so-and-so's, happy-go-f-yourselfs, and whatever colloquial phrases you can come up with now ____________, ______________, ____________.  The chefs are pretty surly, they want to keep the line moving so don't hesitate. Be like me. Get corned beef and cabbage and a giant turkey leg (like at the Ren. fair but not as salty). Then grab some beers and a variety of Tabasco sauces and Beaver brand mustards and go to town.   This is not healthy modern food mind you -- this is the stone age: it's meat and potato wonderland covered in gravy and adorned with a Sara Lee biscuit and garden salad. Come here after traipsing around in downtown in the heat. It's an oasis!",

We happened upon lefty's after we got off the streetcar at Union Sq.  the place reminded me of some old NY bars. It has a lot of character. So it's canteen style, get over it. You get your tray, your cutlery and pick off the menu. I got the roast beef dinner with red potatoes, baked beans and a tomato salad with a dinner roll for about $13. There was a decent selection, my partner got the Reuben sandwich. It was all most excellent. All it was missing was a good Yorkshire pudding. The bar service wasn't as good. I ended up going up to the bar for our drinks but the barman served me right away. He looks like he's got a story or two in him by the looks of things.  The staff were putting up the festive decorations and Xmas music was playing. Next time I'm going back in the evening.  I enjoyed this place, I really like all the old photographs on the wall too. Great beer selection also.",

So then now, I said screw it and decided to wear a blue shirt. The only green item on me was my man bag. Anyways, I think I'm off topic right now. My brother Tim suggested Lefty's for a meal of corned beef and cabbage.  So off we went, into the ol mighty Lefty O'Doul's. As we were about to step in I noticed Japanese words above the doorway..how interesting.. and as we walked inside the place reminded me a lot like Tommy's Joint over on Van Ness. You lined up with a tray and ordered and got seated and thats it.   Mike, Tim, and I all ordered the same thing..Corned beef and cabbage which also came with veggies and potatoes. Tim suggest we ordered the potato salad, the pasta salad, and the macaroni salad. And they also tossed in a fruit salad.   The corned beef was pretty good especially with the horseradish and the cabbage...well tasted like cabbage. The potato salad had loads of bacon so thats a plus and the macaroni was not too shabby either. I didnt really care too much for the pasta salad..something about it didnt strike appealing to me. The fruit salad was refreshing and had an assortment of fruits.  The place is loud with people talking and drinking, sports on the TV's Nice waitresses and a statue of Marilyn Monroe in the back. Overall I had a good time with Tim and Mike. But I can't say it would be a favorite to go to. Maybe when I'm craving for some more corned beef and cabbage....",

Not likely.\" Then he proceeded to say: \"Maybe you should take your business elsewhere\". Shocked at his rudeness and lack of concern for how he spoke to his paying customers, I said \"Is this really the way you talk to customers? That's some great managerial skills.\" After some more remarkable comments by him I said I would leave a bad yelp review and no local Giants fans will go here. I kid you not this is what he then said to me: \"I have 100 customers in here and I'm going to worry about you?

The first couple of times, I shared a turkey sandwich on sourdough and a Cobb salad. Both were good, be sure to ask to dip the inside of your sandwich in the juice. \u00a0  This 3rd time, I shared a corned beef on rye with BFF and we each had a cup of clam chowder. \u00a0The chowder was really good, generous chunks of potatoes, chopped clams i a tasty clam broth. \u00a0I could've eaten a whole bowl of that just for lunch. \u00a0The corned beef is better than the turkey sandwich. \u00a0  It's a hole in the wall with decades of ancient pictures of old Giants icons on the walls. Does have a certain ambience of history to it. \u00a0The bathroom needs upgrading (2 stalls for the women) as one of the towel holder sensors wasn't working and it's all old fixtures. \u00a0Very casual and you just line up with your utensils, trays and let the server know what kind of meal platter or sandwich you want to eat. \u00a0 I couldn't believe some folks were ordering dinner platters for lunch which looked like a lot of food. \u00a0If you want water, you have to go across the room from the food line and fill your glass at the water fountain!

After being disappointed in the first bar we went to, we were already upset as we went to o'douls in hope for a better mood and atmosphere.  Walking into o'douls the music was loud, the people energetic, and the bar was at the perfect capacity for me. However I brought my 21 year old girlfriend here and about every old creepy guy looked at her! Even the wait staff!! Which happened to be the creepiest people there!!  Unfortunately we could've have never known how impolite the staff would be. As I asked about their special for a yelp check-in on bloody marys, I was approached with a laugh attack by the bartender. However right after the male bartender, possible owner, told me that they accepted that deal. But then I was asked for my ID and after I handed it to her, my birthday being three days prior, she took my drivers license and proceeded to bring it to her manager to check what the date was!   Ok what bartender doesn't know the date?  After being snotty towards me, she proceeded to insult my friends who we're celebrating my birthday with me over a few drinks and demanded their ids. after figuring out they were older than she thought she didnt respond with any comment but just a look of disappointment \u00a0that she couldn't kick us out. After being treated this way I slurped my Bloody Mary as fast as possible and my friends refused to get drinks.  One of the worst staffs with hospitality I've ever experienced. Will never be going back. Btw the bartender was a 40 year old woman who was upset she wasn't youthful and the guy bartender wore a mccovey jersey and looked like he shaved since he started packing his bunker for the end of the world in 2012.   Please take my advice if you are ever looking for a good time with nice local San Franciscans and avoid lefty o'douls and the 40 year old snotty waitress and the Yetti.",

My review currently is based solely on the food since I only came here for lunch. There are two entrances, one to the bar side and one to the restaurant side. It doesn't matter what side you enter since they both combine at the front of the restaurant.  When you walk in you pick up a tray and grab your eating utensils, then you order your entree. You then have choices for appetizers and side dishes and dessert, since Thanksgiving is next week I was good and didn't grab a slice of pie.  My friend ordered a pastrami sandwich on i think rye bread. I ordered a chili dog. The chili dog was okay but I think the restaurant is known for their sandwiches rather than their chili dogs. The chili tasted like bbq sauce and if you know me, you know that I don't care for bbq sauce much (i only eat it on my ribs and my western burger at carl's jr.). Needless to say i finished what i could from the hot dog and pushed half the chili to the side. I hate wasting food but I started feeling nauseous throughout my meal.  Fortunately the staff was nice and it seemed very spacious. The crowd seemed a bit older than my usual cup of tea, but it seemed like a nice little place to grab a sandwich if you are on the go. The food here is kind of pricey though so if you do want more on \u00a0your sandwich for more/less the price they charge here then you might want to go to subway which is on ellis.  I will be updating soon enough on drinks and sandwiches when I get the chance to try them both!",

Until midnight, which is a huge plus if you're staying in Union Square.There are daily specials. But the tried and true food choices are the hand-carved roast beef, turkey or ham. I usually opt for them in a sandwich, sourdough of course and have the bread dipped in au jus. Just what the Dr. ordered... They've got whole turkey legs too. Corned beef &amp; cabbage, pastramis, reubens, etc.  Drinks upon drinks are available here. Prices are very reasonable. The waitresses we've had were all super cool...

As far as the tv situation goes, two of em didn't work and for a restaurant in Union Square you would assume they would make it a priority to watch the Giants game over any other sports game.

Once inside, it's pretty dark but the walls are filled with some pretty cool Giants memorabilia. Food is served cafeteria style. There also aren't many choices, but because the line moves a little quicker than you may expect (at least it did for us), here's not the place to let out your inner indecisive foodie.  We eventually settled on a corned beef sandwich and pastrami sandwich with a side of soup. The soup was a creamy chower and definitely on the saltier side. Both sandwiches were decent, but they were too similar, we really couldn't tell the difference between the two which was a little disappointing.  All in all, it was worth the try, but that's about it. 2 stars for the food and 1 extra for the atmosphere.",

I've always been attracted to the large white banner that promises \"the best deal on the square\" for breakfast between 7 and 11 AM. I am a sucker for breakfast food and work mornings nearby, so I'd eventually have to see about this breakfast.  So, when I did go, maybe it was an off day. I came in near the end of their breakfast and waited maybe a couple minutes to be seated. Everyone was working really hard and it was late in the morning on a weekend. No bad vibes, and my order was taken promptly as I sat and took in the baseball-themed ambiance.  I was disappointed to see their enthusiasm for brewing Starbucks coffee. I drink coffee black, but I couldn't stand the coffee I was served without diluting it with half-and-half. Don't understand why they're brewing coffee dregs and feeling proud of it, but it's neither here nor there. It was served in a cool mug!  I ordered eggs over medium, pancakes, and toast. The eggs were not bad at all, and the pancakes so sugary that I had no need for the tubs of Mrs. Butterworth's high-fructose syrup chilling in a bowl beside my plate. It was a fair helping of food. It was about $8 for this.  Unfortunately, the waiter forgot the toast I ordered (as if I need more carbs anyway). I wasn't charged for it, but it also wasn't taken out of the total for the special I ordered, in which toast was a substitute for meat. So, I didn't make a fuss, and instead paid as it was without leaving a tip. Felt like that was fair.  I thought it was an interesting place for its tourist trap aspects, but I wouldn't recommend it for a breakfast around Union Square. I don't agree that it is the best deal either considering that I get better service and food at the hole-in the-wall caf\u00e9 around the corner. To each their own!",

So creepy that we opted to move to the more \"happening\" \"piano\". Yes, those are both in quotations as the \"piano\" is a keyboard and the \"happening\" was the threesome of 80-something y/o folk canoodling in the corner. Erm, guys... isn't there somewhere else we can drink? Like maybe back at the hotel, or even a dark alley somewhere?   I, for one, am all for Filipino sports piano Irish bars with margarita specials and four different types of beaver brand mustard on the table, but if you're going to provide for that niche, do it right, for Christ's sake.   I think something about Irish bars and I just don't get along. I'd always thought I'd liked them from growing up with a mother who loves Irish pot roast and fish and chips from the local pub. I remembered having a decent time, I guess, but then as an \"adult\" (yes, quotes), I've never really found one that did it for me. Hell, even finding one that qualifies for 4 stars in my book has been difficult. I think I'm maybe just not a fan of mediocre beer selection and all-too-often dry and/or over fried food. And while I didn't dare venture to the foodie side of things at Lefty O'Doul's, I can tell you that what I had was \u00a0enough.   I think with all the different levels of crazy that this place is working off, it could be something really special... or at least fun. But instead it's just awkward and uncomfortable, and the \"crazy old Maurice\" waitress mixed with woo much of everything with too little explanation just didn't do it for me, in any capacity. \u00a0I'm good till next lifetime, prolly.",

Anyhow, I happen to know the Harold Arlen songbook (no wisecracks), so I was semi-drunk standing next to the old lady playing the mini-grand piano. She started to sing \"Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf?\" and didn't like the way I was doing the tra-la-la's. Next thing I knew I was outside flat on my polyester derriere.  Flash forward a decade or two and I have returned. Jamie W. and I were looking for a quick bite before a show we were seeing at the Rrazz Room in the Hotel Nikko. Flashbacks came over me, but I decided I'd forgive and forget. \u00a0Wasn't that big of me? Besides that old lady would be 105 by now. Nope, she wasn't there, but the piano still was amazingly. For some reason, I don't remember it being a cafeteria-type place, but hey, I'm no snob.  I went for the $9.89 Corned Beef Dinner. A mite pricey, t'is true, but you do get two sides, and I went for a major wedge of boiled cabbage and mashed potatoes, of course. I even got a dish of macaroni salad, too. What more do you want from Lefty? The place looks like a big Kiwanis Club meeting hall with tables that have that unmistakable Levitz air about them. The European tourists seem to like it. Reminds them of a beer hall back home in the old country. The bar is a happening spot for middle-aged locals. Oh wait, that would be me.  FOOD - 3 stars...like going to school if the district could have only afforded a hofbrau AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...maybe they'll make me wear the lodge beaver-tail cap next time SERVICE - 3 stars...the servers were dexterous with the tongs TOTAL - 3 stars...priced for the tourists but it has a certain Lions Club appeal",

They have hearty portions for their lunch specials and their salads are super fresh, made-to-order and HUGE! I always get the Greek salad with extra feta and no olives - its so good! Their dressing is made in-house and so are their soups and chili. Their open-face turkey sandwich is very tender and the gravy is perfect, not too salty, not too thick. Their tamales are pretty big, enough for two people for sure. I haven't tried their meatloaf yet but it's definitely on my radar to try next.  The restaurant has TONS of old-school memorabilia all over the walls and encased in glass stands; from autographed photos of baseball greats and original NY Giants baseball jerseys, to hockey sticks and boxing gloves. They also have a full bar in the front a separate dining area in the back if you wish to be waited on. Otherwise the front is self-serve, seat-yourself, or you can plant at a \"piano-bar\" in the immediate front, but food isn't allowed there.  The owner and front waiters/waitresses are very friendly and always remember their 'regulars\". Even if you aren't, they're very welcoming and make sure you're acknowledged from the start of your dining experience to the end!",

Uh, what?  Personally, I had no idea what that the place being \"a hofbrau place\" meant, so I just nodded dumbly and agreed. The place smelled heavenly, I was starving, so it seemed like a good mix.  The interior is really dimly lit. And apparently hofbrau means a buffet-style serving area, where you pre-order your food then pay for it. Or so that's how I took it to mean. It brought back memories of lining up at my elementary school cafeteria and telling the lunch ladies what I wanted to eat as I watched them dish it up. I ordered their turkey enchilada dinner (their special of the day) with a side of rice and the boyfriend ordered some sort of meat dinner (I can't remember what meat he got, but the dinner came with two sides also -- he got their baked beans and veggies, I think).  The portions are huge, and pretty decent for the price you pay. My enchilada was essentially a gigantic wet burrito, though the turkey was a little tough to chew. But the food is overall scrumptious. It might not always be my first pick for a night out, but I fully enjoyed what I had. When I go back, I'm definitely going to get a meat dinner tray thing instead. The boyfriend's meat was rare and juicy, and the baked beans were to die for (I think that might have been my favorite part, actually).  It's self-seating, so after you pay you simply go hunt down a table at which to sit. There is also a full bar (or so it appeared to be anyway; I didn't really study it up close) right by the entrance if you want to have some booze with your meat instead of soda or water (which you have to get for yourself from what appears to be a tap).  Really, the place seems to be a bit of a tourist trap (after all, it is located right off of Union Square). But for the tourist (or even the local) in need for hearty, delicious comfort food, this would be the place to go to.",

Sort of similar to Harry's Hofbrau or I should say the reverse since LO'D came first.   Piano is by the picture window, right by the entrance and the crowd can get raucous.

Huge room in the back but the whole place is lit with a weirdly, dim yellow light, but that observation could have been because of certain libations marinating my grey matter.  Lots of tourists, families and locals. They do a great Christmas Eve toy drive where people can drop off new, unwrapped toys.

He was a musician from Florida that I had met 20 minutes earlier. Lefty O'Doul's said it was a piano bar. It seemed like a good fit.  Being that it was midday, there was no piano playing going on, which has left me at a loss for how to categorize this place. I've never seen anything quite like it before. It's like a hot lunch buffet crossed with a pub and a sports bar. We walked in to find a cafeteria style line up for food. Four different kinds of meats, a variety of hot sides, like 8 different kinds of salads, enchiladas, my stomach growled.  I dug into the roast beef meal withed mash potatoes, mac'n'cheese, a bun and a salad. The guy behind the counter asked me if I wanted some of the roast beef jus on top. Sounded good to me! I thought he'd put a bit of it over the roast beef and maybe the potatoes. Instead, he poured it over them and then made a big dent in the potatoes with his ladle and poured even more jus into that. It was like roast beef jus soup rather than a roast beef dinner!  The enchilada my lunch mate ordered was bigger than anything I've ever seen. It stretched the entire length of his plate, and man was it every fat! (and p.h.a.t.). Neither of us finished our meals, not because they weren't good, but because there was so much food!  Not bad for a lunch time meal, but after reading a few of the other reviews, I want to come back for the piano bar!",

Also, if you're hungry, there 's a cafeteria-style food bar with hand-carved meats. I've never tried the food so I can't say much about it, but I do know that no junk food is served here ( I once asked if they were serving fries and burgers and the answer is NO).   Decent ambience and not overcrowded. Music is ok. Variety of tap beer. A lot of older folks. Great location (by Union Square). I'd like to come here for couple drinks and socialize with out of town friends OR just friends after work in the evening. Don't rely on a waitress to quickly come to take your order. If you can't wait for a drink, just go to order and grab one at the bar directly. I would say it is more of a place where you socialize or reconnect with old pal, having couple drinks, and that's how I define it. Expecting more than that, you may be disappointed.",

It was a bit confusing since no one greeted us, we had no idea who worked there, and it was pretty dark for 5 PM. We decided to just keep walking to the back, where we found another bar. We set up shop there to watch the game.   The TVs are subpar for a sports bar. The bartender was attentive to us, though we were not so demanding. He was having a rough time as the game went on and it got more packed because he didn't know where anything was. We heard him tell others it was his first day. Didn't seem like management's best call to start someone on what has got to be a busy night. Anyways, like I said, he got us everything we wanted and was super nice. The drinks were fine, but a little pricey. I guess that's because we were in Union Square? The bathroom wasn't the cleanest.   Bf and I agreed that it must have been a great place in its heyday, but it seems pretty dated now.

Halfway through the meal, a parade of cockroaches started running across the booth that we were sitting in. I've said before in other reviews that I previously worked for 10 years in restaurants. A lot of good that did... I just didn't think. Anyhow, I have worked in a place just like this, and I can attest to the fact that if the roaches are that bold, the place is filthy. We instantly walked out, leaving the remainder of our meal on the table. No wonder they want you to pay first. I just feel guilty for letting us all get past the front door. I don't care how long this place has been around... it needs to be shut down, gutted, and rebuilt from scratch to get rid of the foul underpinnings that are attracting despicable pests. DO NOT GO HERE unless all you want is a bottled beer - and skip the glass. Consider the visit like a safari to places unknown with creatures that will at least make your stomach turn, if not get you sick. The only bit of positivity was the female bartender in the rear bar. She deserves so much better than that. I hope she moves on to something better than this place. The nice thing about working in restaurants is getting a shift meal or a heavily discounted meal.

Unlike most Irish pubs, there is a rather large impromtu dance floor where blonde cougars and homeless men both like to get down. Although it is usually pretty crowded, you get the sense that either people aren't drinking or the service is incredible because it's never difficult to order at the bar. Beers on tap are pretty standard; mixed drinks are pretty shabby. Also, they do a toy drive with SFFD every Christmas which is awesome.   Good time for tourists or old timey San Franciscans.",

So, on our visit to SF, we went out of our way to visit Lefty's so I could order one of their famous Bloody Marys. It was 5pm, and the restaurant was only slightly busy.  The good: the man who prepared our food at the cafeteria-style line was friendly, helpful, and did a nice job. We ordered sandwiches, and the food was decent.  The bad: everything went downhill as soon as we scooted our trays to the register. The cashier was surly, and when I asked her how to order a Bloody Mary she indicated that we needed to sit down and someone would take our drink order. We sat at our booth for 45 minutes, and not once did anyone come to see how we were doing, refill water, or take a drink order.  I made hopeful eye contact a few times with the waitress whose section we were obviously seated in, but to no avail. I am left wondering if she \"didn't like the cut of our jib,\" or if we were seated in a \"no-service\" section or something. It was bizarre, to say the least.  We left the restaurant scratching our heads. It was not a positive experience. I felt stupid for putting it on our \"must see\" list of things to do in San Francisco. My date was left feeling insecure, and wondered why the waitress didn't like us. I was disappointed that my little daydream of having an actual Lefty's Bloody Mary turned out to be such a let down. :(",

I can see why people like this place. It is a glorious mess! It seemed that everybody coming in knew each other, and sometime you wanna go where everybody knows your name. But be warned: This place is a little less Cheers, and a little more It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Think Sam and Diane, after huffing a few cans of spray paint.   Where shall we start? How about with Rio (I think?) the waitress. She was friendly. And fast. A little too fast, if that's possible. We had a group of four, and the last to order practically had to yell out his beer b/c she was already shuffling off to get our beers. Still, she got us all of the correct beers and they were at the table in like 2 minutes. In a town that seems to have a mandatory 5 minute allowance for bartenders to sneer at you with their waxy mustaches before they'll even consider making your order, this was certainly refreshing.  You know what else looked refreshing? The OFFICIAL LEFTY O'DOULS KEY LIME MARGARITA! Oh wait, you didn't know about it? Then you must not have eyeballs. There are signs for it everywhere. Kind of a funny drink for an Irish Pub. You know who might have a 50% chance of knowing about THE OFFICIAL LEFTY O'DOULS KEY LIME MARGARITA? Old Doris, with her very special Valentine's Day heart-shaped eye patch. She's a hoot.   If you're hungry, there's a meat line. Yep, just grab yourself a cafeteria tray and go get you some beef. They seem to have different daily specials, but I prefer to think that everything is special at the official Lefty O'douls meat line.   The ambiance is a treat. We decided to relocate to the seats around the piano. Actually that's not quite true. We decided to relocate to the keyboard with a surrounding piano-shaped piece of wood. The guy playing was...alright. He sang the words on occasion, but not with any regularity. This gave the impression that we were actually listening to some sort of spoken word performance art piece. By an oompah loompah. Dude, lay off the tanning bed...you're in San Francisco. But that being said, he did jump right into Rocket Man without skipping a beat as soon as I threw a five spot into his tip jar. Good man.  And then it was time to go. I simply couldn't handle another ounce of Lefty O'Douls awesomeness. But there's always next time.",

We were staying in Union Square and had two dinners because we did not want to spend a capital with fancy restaurants every day or waste our health with cheap fast food.  Lefty is an old style kind of irish pub with a self-service canteen style food. You put your food on your tray, pay and move to a table where you can order beverages.The food is simple but not of bad quality. There are daily options/specials, as an example you can have a roast beef with potatoes, salad and bread for around 13$. They also have good soups for 3-4 bucks. I loved the cream broccoli soup! Considering that you are in Union square I beat there is no other place around where you can get a better price/quality tradeoff.  But this is not all.... while the food might seem average this is just to calm your hunger... the best is to enjoy a good selection of beers with daily live music. I suggest the Palm, a good strong Belgiam red beer. The first day there was a piano bar with real piano and solo pianist... while the second day there was a 70's George Benson style jazz band. The nice part is that you can sit just around the piano or the band to enjoy your drink and being close to the musicians.",

Their tap selection is pretty good: Stella, Guinness, Anchor Steam, Speakeasy, Boddingtons, Smithwick's, etc. But get the Left Arm Ale.  The food is good too. Decently priced, hearty, and tasty. You can have Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner any day of the year. They do handcarved meats. The mashed potatoes are creamy. The ham not too salty. Good luck choosing between all the potato salads.

The employees were very organized: one or two got the drink orders and about three or four took the orders and brought the food.  I ordered the apple flapjacks with apple-chicken sausage. \u00a0My table was toward the back of the seating area. \u00a0But, within 30 seconds of starting to smell my breakfast from the kitchen, the food server brought it to me. \u00a0Now that's fast!  The meal was excellent. \u00a0I was looking around for syrup but the flapjacks didn't really need it. \u00a0The sausage was the way sausage is supposed to taste and look: full flavored and not shriveled like you'd get at Denny's. \u00a0It was very worth the $10 price tag.  About the only thing I would change is adding a breakfast menu with prices out in front. \u00a0The only breakfast notice out there now is when it's served.",

Full bar....lots of beer......cheap drinks.....attentive staff....no waits....food if you want it...a mix of tourists and locals, and it lacks the usual jagoffs that frequent financial district (if you're from the City, you say \"Financial District\", if you say, or have ever said \"FiDi\", then you are one of these jagoffs) bars.....they have a piano guy that sings songs in the style of a \"silly goose\" \u00a0that become more entertaining as you contiunue to drink....the waitresses are kind of hot, but not so hot that they wouldn't talk to you hot...

Sad, but true. We shared pancakes and a corn beef hash and eggs (over medium). Now, if you know me, corn beef hash and eggs is my go-to brekky.

We got the Roast Turkey dinner which includes choice of 1 small cold salad + 2 hot sides for $10.29  For the sides, we got potato salad, mashed potatoes, and steamed cabbage.  The turkey was too salty. \u00a0The steamed cabbage was horrible. \u00a0The mashed potato was also too salty. \u00a0The only thing that tasted DECENT was the potato salad. \u00a0I had mix the potato salad with every bite I took, to mask the taste of the food served here.  In addition to that, we ordered a round of 6 shots. \u00a0When they brought us the receipt for the shots, we saw that they overcharged us by $50. \u00a0How could you mess up a bill with only 6 shots as the order. \u00a0  Most people probably would not check their receipt and would probably pay it .. so.. check your receipts!",

I went in with a small group on a recent Saturday night and was incredibly offended by Dan, the bartender. When a friend ordered a pitcher of Bud, he was ridiculed by Dan to such a point that my friend did not feel inclined to tip. When this friend made his feelings known, Dan escalated the exchange into a confrontation and then cut all of us off. Having worked in food service, I am not sure why Dan would ever expect anything after laying out a host of snide, pretentious, and elitist comments. I hope that Lefty's is able to somehow re-earn the substantial respect it has lost in my eyes.",

I was looking to try a different sushi restaurant instead of my usual, \"Ken's\" on Foothill.  The size is very intimate and the staff were very friendly. Roy always ask if you're allergic to any types of fish and that's very reassuring to know he cares about his customers. It can get busy on the weekends, so it's best to come as early as possible to get a good seat. Patrons are friendly and has the small town feel.   Sushi was very very fresh!   Service was excellent!  I was looking for a reasonably price watering hole on Yelp, not too far from my hotel (Sir Francis Drake) and Lefty O'Doul's showed up on the list. It was a toss between this and some dive bar ran by Koreans, so I picked this bar because it was closer and had that Irish theme to it.   This diner / bar was a great escape from those fancy hotel bars and it has a lot of character. Don't let the appearance fool you, it may look small from the outside but as you venture in the bar towards the diner area, it was pretty spacious and the crowded! \u00a0 Mostly tourists, visitors, and some locals come here to relax and enjoy the live entertainment and the beer.   I ordered a pitcher of Guinness for $17 which was a pretty steep but the live entertainment made up for it. The patrons very not rowdy and were fun to talk to and the customer service was great. The restrooms are located in the basement part of the building and you have to walk a steep stairs to get to it, it feels as though you're about to fall.   Lefty O'Doul's was fairly clean, I didn't get to try the food and like some Yelpers said, \"It looks cafeteria style\", \u00a0I'll agree to that! If I'm ever in the area, I might stop over just to have a drink and do some people watching, than venture out into Downtown.",

The least crowded was the back section where there are extra tables and another smaller bar.   The place is larger than it looks from the outside and there's quite a crowd in there. They have good drinks and decent food. The big negative is that it can get a bit dirty in there, especially the bathrooms. It doesn't seem like they pay much attention to cleaning it often enough. On the other hand, it's a plus that they don't charge cover at night to get in. Not sure why some other Irish Pubs would even charge cover...sounds like an odd concept to me.

Food: Stick-to-your ribs comfort food. \u00a0I went with a turkey dinner, with mac-n-cheese, potatoes, and a side salad. \u00a0Not fancy, and it doesn't need to be. \u00a0Simple food that can be enjoyed by young and old alike. \u00a0The prices are ok for a spot that is near Union Square. \u00a0  Service: Line up and choose your food cafeteria-style; the line can get super-long, but it moves pretty quickly. \u00a0 The missus and I were happy to , and of course the kids didn't want to eat there. \u00a0One wanted a burger, and the other wanted pizza. \u00a0Luckily, a block away there was a pizza-by-the-slice joint and a Jack in the Box. \u00a0We got the food to go and walked back to Lefty's. \u00a0When we sat down, the manager came over and said we couldn't eat outside food there, even though my wife had ordered dinner there. \u00a0My older daughter burst into tears as I walked out with the kids, looking for a spot on the sidewalk to hunker down and feed the kids. \u00a0We found a spot and went back to Lefty's, where the manager was very apologetic and gave me a free drink coupon. \u00a0He even gave the kids a couple bowls of mac n cheese on the house. \u00a0He felt bad that my daughter was upset and explained that it was a liability thing - can't have outside food there in case something goes wrong. \u00a0I totally understood, and it was very nice of him to buy me a beer. \u00a0Turned a negative into a positive pretty quick, and it's that kind of service that will bring me back to a restaurant.  Vibe: Piano-bar-sports-bar-hofbrau-chic. \u00a0Loads of Giants memorabilia, and lots of choices to keep you entertained: TV screens, piano bar, or a bunch of beers on tap. I can imagine it gets appropriately rowdy on game days, which is how it should be.  Family-friendly: Definitely, as long as your fussy kids don't try and bring outside food in! \u00a0I still can't say enough about how nice the manager was with our situation.  Summary: Come for the comfort food, or the drink selection, or the piano bar. \u00a03 stars for the place, plus an extra star for the great manager.",

The bar scene on Friday and Saturday nights is pretty fantastic, but catching people out of the corner of your eye sliding lunch trays down the metal rail while they order up (smelly) cuts of meats and carb-loaded side dishes really kills the piano bar vibe.  But the man belting out tunes on the black and white keys, Frank O'Connor, makes you forget all of that. (As will a half dozen Anchor Porters.) The man's an absolute joy to listen to and a comic to boot. Enjoyed his show so much my first night in Frisco I opted to go back again the next rather than hike around town in search of another venue.  As for the smell, if you can't take any more corned beef (and you're a dude), wander downstairs to the mens room. That musty smell in the stairwell will transport you back to years gone by, to your grandparents house or to your local VFW, and when you return to the bar the piano music will sound a bit clearer, the beer will taste a bit crisper, and you'll stop wondering when the tour bus full of gray hairs is going to pull up for dinner....",

The bartenders are prompt and quick. I rarely had to wait among the Santas. A shot of whiskey was around $4.00, and a Hef was around $5.00. I was able to meet a few fellas that didn't mind throwing down some shots with me, but also met a creepy 16 year old boy from Germany. Jingle Bells was the theme song of the hour, and a strike for Christmas was well underway.   Did this review make sense to you? Yeah, that's exactly the time you will have at Lefty O'Douls.

Roast beef? \u00a0No rare pieces, but mine was maybe medium to medium well. \u00a0I ordered mine with boiled mini potatoes, but mashed was available. \u00a0I got a generous serving of roast beef slices, potatoes, mixed veggies of the day, a small salad, all for $12.36, tax included. \u00a0  Drinks and desserts are extra. \u00a0   Found plenty of seating in the back area - some large screen tv's were on, tuned in to MLB, of course. \u00a0  Ambiance sort of reminded me of Millers,in downtown Chicago (next to Palmer House).

The hotel bar was small so we went in search of a place to kill sometime before dinner and get an adult beverage.  Right down the street (short walking distance) from the hotel we came acrossed Lefty O'Doul's. \u00a0The place was great.  Restaurant/SportsBar.  Although we did not eat there was a line of people waiting to eat. The food looked good and the people looked happy!!  While having a cold beer we watched the Giants game and baskeball games on their many tv's.  We left for dinner and once dinner at the hotel reastaurant was over, we headed back to O'Doul's The service was fast and friendly, thank you Sara!!",

Do you recall the cafeteria line in grade school, when everything was unappetizing looking? Want to experience that again? 2. Do you like to visit sports bars to look at old sports memorabilia instead of watching sports? 3. Do you miss that old shoddy tv you donated to the thrift store 10 years ago and want to see it in use today? 4. Is iceberg your favorite kind of lettuce?  If you answered yes to any of the above questions, odoules is your place.   Otherwise, go to a different sports bar that has modern TVs, sports channels other than espn1 and CBS, and food that is actually good.",

I ordered some roast beef with some macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes with a pepsi. The guys were generous with the amount of portions they added onto the plate.

    "review_text": "I've been to Lefty's a few times, but have always sat towards the back of the bar/restaurant. I can't recall what my food order was (as it was awhile ago and must've been inebriated), so this review is strictly based on the BAR scene and not on the food.  My friend and I stopped in here to kill some time before she had to take BART back down to SSF. I knew they had live entertainment at Lefty's, and my friend, Greg, totally raves about the piano singer, so thought it'd be fun to check it out. We roll in and look for a table, and the lovely Eastern European server (who was looking hot in a black leather mini and red pumps) helped us find the perfect seats. She looked amazing for her age (probably in her 50s), and wish I could rock it like that when I'm that old. She was very attentive and always checked in on us despite how crowded the bar got later on.  Anyway, we sat right behind the piano man, Frank. He is a total entertainer, with an incredible voice and plays the piano (actually keyboard) so well! He's funny, and plays off of the crowd by greeting people when they walk in and asks where they're from, and of course, teases them as well!  My friend, Cin, and I thought we'd be in the clear since he was in midsong upon our entrance, but boy, were we so wrong! He asks where we're from and I tell him NOPA or Western Addition, and totally starts poking fun of me and my BFF! Heck, he even blasted Cin later on as she went to the bathroom! So much for quietly going to the loo. Hah! Frank takes any and all requests, and can sing almost any hit from Journey's 'Don't Stop believing' to Frank Sinatra's 'New York, New York. In fact, he also played Bob Marley's 'Three Little Birds.'' \u00a0  The crowd at Lefty's is a mix of locals and tourists, as well as older and younger folks. It's such a friendly, fun, and familial vibe. An older lady who sat next to us seemed to know the 20something Aussie gals and St. Louis (there I go with my midwest thang again) fella. She even befriended the couple sitting on the other side of her. I swear she was quite the socialite and absolutely loving it. She was totally groovin to the the hits while sipping her whiskey with a water back! DAMN lady! You go! Cin and I had to give her a hug and props upon leaving! She was the cutest ever!  Lefty's is a truly solid place, and it's always a fun time here. Cheap drinks, awesome entertainment (Frank plays Friday and Saturday nites), and friendly locals and tourists. I know they'll be more good times ahead at Lefty's, and next time, I'll try their grub. Anyone want to come with?",

So it's me and 4 guys who just wanted a beer and some sports. Soon as we went in we saw a line for the food. We walked to the back and we saw: a bunch of tvs without sound, a bunch of reserved tables and a crowd of older disgruntled patrons. Never have I complained about the patrons before.   The people: they were upset we were finding a table. One patron did the hand motion that he was watching us.  The sound: there was none. For a bar full of tvs, the only sound we heard was Christmas music. Not really a sports bar.  Everything else about this place sucked as well and we had a very disappointing experience. Nothing was redeemable here. And we jumped ship even before the commercial.",

I popped in LODs for a quick bite to eat, since we were in the neighborhood, gawking at the humongoid Xmas tree with all the other folks in search of Xmas spirit this afternoon. \u00a0I've been here a few times in the past, and kinda had an idea of what to expect.  Stepping into LODs is kinda like a time warp back to say, 1972 or something... it's set up like a cafeteria from the days of polyester and gas-thirsty V8s under the hood. \u00a0 Very strange feeling, indeed. \u00a0You grab a tray, silverware, and shimmy down the line to place your order.  The food choices are old standbys - various sandwiches, all hand carved right infront of you. \u00a0Corned beef and cabbage, turkey legs with stuffing. \u00a0They've got several cheap choices in the form of everyday specials - some venturing into the sub $6 area (spaghetti and meat sauce). \u00a0 I opted for a hand carved turkey samich, 3 bean salad (another throwback to the 1970s- or maybe even earlier), and an iced tea to wash it all down.  The quality was good- there was a thick slab of turkey slices on my roll. \u00a0I asked the dude to dip it in the sauce for good measure, but it was still a little on the dry side. \u00a0A liberal squeeze of the Beaver brand honey mustard fixed that.  The interior vibe adds to the serious nostalgia factor of Lefty's. \u00a0In a word, GIANTS MANIA! \u00a0 I dare not imagine what would happen to the guy \u00a0who walks in wearing a LA baseball cap on his head! \u00a0 LOD's place is a solid bet for a good, filling, not to expensive FAST meal. \u00a0If you're in the Union Square area, and find yourself in need of some good reasonably priced grub, check out Lefty's. \u00a0  3 out of 5 stars from me.",

First trip was a Thursday night, four years ago. \u00a0Live piano-music, warm environment. \u00a0It reminded me a little of the \u00a0German-style bars in Madison, WI (home to my alma mater). \u00a0Not too loud or obnoxious, and plenty of space. \u00a0Warm. \u00a0I went back on my second trip to SF - this time for a drink before hopping on BART and flying home. \u00a0Great conversation with a few visitors. \u00a0Nice bartender - pretty sure it's still the same guy all this time later. \u00a0Then - I kept hearing the name when watching Giants games in Denver on the MLB package. \u00a0Third trip - also for the bar - was the night I moved to SF in November of 2011. \u00a0Immediately felt at home, and struck up a couple of nice conversations with visitors.  I've been back a few times for games on the walk home - but, I FINALLY tried the food for lunch a few weeks back with my buddy from work. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0This is a Hof Brau-style restuarant, where you go through the line with a tray. \u00a0They have fresh, hand-sliced Corned Beef, Pastrami, Turkey, Roast Beef and Ham - I had a Corned Beef on Rye. \u00a0Holy cow. \u00a0Really, really good - and only $7. \u00a0Then, it's seat yourself - three kinds of mustard, plus horseradish on the table. \u00a0So good. \u00a0They also have daily specials ranging from Chicken Enchiladas to Lamb Shanks. \u00a0And, Spaghetti and Meatballs every day.  Two additional meals stand out on this menu:  1. \u00a0For Breakfast - Corned Beef Hash. \u00a0Served with Two Eggs, any style, and toast. \u00a0Lots of corned beef. \u00a0Lots of peppers and onion. \u00a0I get Eggs Over Easy, but should get them poached. \u00a0Lots of Ketchup, too. 2. \u00a0Reuben and a side of Macaroni and Cheese. \u00a0The Reuben is huge with hand-carved corned beef. \u00a0See it to believe it. \u00a0Lots of sauerkraut, thousand island and Swiss cheese on light and airy rye. \u00a0IT is tremendous. \u00a0They give you about three or four pickles, too. \u00a0The Macaroni and Cheese is so good. \u00a0They also serve it as an entree. \u00a0  I immediately put this place into my lunch rotation - delicious, home-style, and a good value. \u00a0The bar is a bit spendy. \u00a0It's not far-off from a five, particularly given some of the tourist characters I've met. \u00a0Love the old school (authentic) SF sports memorabilia., and the tradition.",

Lots of sports memorabilias hung on wall all over the place and I mean every sport you can think of they'll have something for your liking. Back area has more flatscreens mostly it's for larger groups like us 23 people+1 baby in group. Bar is just across from the hofbrau so that's were you start grab food one side and drinks on other.  Staff: Everyone was dress in full gear representing the 49er's even if they didn't have on any they get creative by creating some red&amp;gold on their clothing. I think they know today besides Superbowl is the money maker days meaning lots of tips for the day. Forgot our server name always checking up on us and smiling. She was definitely in it and would check on us periodically on a time manner.  Cleanliness: It's a sports bar and restaurant so don't expect t much just take it in strides. The restrooms here is my only gripe as you have to go down a flight of stairs and I mean like the kind of stairs in tight area deep straight drop. People with knee problems or arthritis may find this difficult. The water fountain has that long goose neck spout saw a guy walk up and rinse his hands in it yuck.  Eats/Drinks: Pitcher of Sierra Nevada IPA,roast beef sandwich on wheat,3 bean salad,buffalo wings,mixed fruit bowl,baked lays chips. We share everything that was order prices on tab with our friend so I don't know just there to enjoy and grub. I had a turkey drumstick also for extra protein thing weight around 3lb with bone intact.  Products: Hofbrau,drinks,full bar,hot&amp;cold plates,hot&amp;cold drinks,side items,daily specials,specialty plates,create your own meal,burgers,fries,salads,soups,desserts etc.  Punch Line: Great for sports fan,happy hour,hofbrau,friendly staff,big flat screens,servers gets drinks in an instant,nearby shopping union square.  Final Thoughts: Place is pretty dim an ideal place for someone like Whitey Bulger to hideout during his days on the run. This is an Irish bar so expect people on lunch breaks to stop by for take outs in the hofbrau section. Come here if you want to catch a game and have a quick bite by all means there are other places around this area that is better.",

    "review_text": "I came to Lefty's to watch the Niners and Packers game a week ago. This was my first time catching a game and trying their food.  I expected any and all sports bars in the City and County of San Francisco to be absolutely packed but that just wasn't the case with Lefty's. While it was fairly easy to get drinks from the bar, there just wasn't enough local Niners spirit for me :( Instead there were tons of tourists and an much older crowd. Not to mention that the tv's are small and you could barely hear the sound.  In order to sit in their tables or booths, you needed to order food. In order to eat their food, you needed to ALREADY have an table or booth. After going back and forth a couple times with staff, they finally gave up and let us order food BEFORE actually getting a table.  The food wasn't bad but it also wasn't anything to write home about. I had an carved turkey sandwich and a side of macaroni and cheese, all for ~$12. The turkey was moist but the sandwich overall just didn't have a ton of flavor. The mac and cheese, however, was delicious!   While Lefty's is probably one of the better bars in Union Square, I'm not sure if I'll be back to watch any sports games.",

    "review_text": "If there is s an Irish bar within a five mile radius, I most certainly will stumble into it...figuratively, and yes, sometimes literally (usually the latter) on my way out.   What has now turned into a very nostalgic joint, Lefty O' Doul's (named after and opened by a baseball player originally from San Fran) restaurant opened in 1958 - not sure if the current location located right off of Union Square is the same spot or not. If not, could have fooled me. The establishment has a long, deep bar, lots of wood and copper, tons of baseball memorabilia throughout, and the cafeteria-style food counter to the right. Looks straight out of the 50s, but hey, what do I know? ;)  Great location for visitors staying in the Union Square area, as LOD's is one of the few places open until 2 am 7 days a week (kitchen closes early, so please check hours).   They serve up $8 draft beers, have an interactive piano player as entertainment (not the best I've ever seen or heard), and plate some decent chow on the restaurant side. The corned beef looked so good I had to try some one night. It was tasty, but a bit dry and (as expected) overpriced for the few slices o' beef that I ordered. So, if the counter is open, it is easy to get to food fast, but no takeout??? Hmm...maybe if I would have taken my own container they would have been more obliged? \u00a0  LOD's definitely seems like a local hangout (especially during the hours when people just left work and perhaps are putting off their commute out of the city), but does have downtown tourist prices.   Overall: Not bad. Open late. Perfect for last call before heading back to your hotel room - unless you prefer the almost always boring lobby bars...in which case, you're probably not cool enough for Irish hangs in the first place. Lol. Sorry...it's funny because it's true. Sl\u00e1inte! To your health!",

    "review_text": "We wanted to try this place before we left SF, unfortunately, we didn't get the chance until breakfast on our last day. It wasn't the greatest experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Granted, from the moment we were seated we only had an hour to eat and leave, but I think that should have been more than enough time for breakfast on a Saturday morning (7am-ish).  The place was really packed but we got seated right away. After a few minutes the waitress took our order and brought us our juice. This is where it went badly.....it was 45 minutes before we got our food! I know the place was busy but 45 mins is a long time to wait even when its busy. If that was the wait time they should have told us when they took our order!  After 20 mins of waiting my husband getting leery of the time flagged down the waitress to ask about our orders. She said that it was taking a long time because there was a large party and they all needed to be served first. That party was state right near us, they were their before us and some even had meals. I know restaurants like to serve whole tables at once but does EVERY cook need to be working on that one table? My husband indicated that we didn't have very much time to wait and she told us she would check on how long it would be.   At 45 mins the waitress said our food would be right out. At that point my husband had already asked for and paid the bill to make our getaway as quick as possible. (It was about a 5 minute walk back to our hotel, thankfully everything was packed but we needed to promptly meet the bus to take us to the airport our front).  We got our food mins after she said it would be right out. I had ordered an omelet with home fries and toast, my husband had ordered pancakes with toast. He took two big bites of the pancakes, grabbed the bread, told me to eat as much as I could in a few mins and he would meet me in front of the hotel.   I put my toast wrapped in a napkin in my purse and stuffed some of the omelet and as many home fries as I could in 3 bites and pretty much ran out of the restaurant. When I got to the lobby of the hotel, the bus was outside and the driver was talking to the front desk and dining our room ( it was about 3 mins late). As I was about to go upstairs my husband appeared in the lobby with our luggage and apologized to the driver.   Overall, I know busy restaurant on a saturday morning is not going to offer quick service, but as I said earlier, I think an hour was more than enough time eat breakfast even at a busy place. We were VERY disappointed in the service and I don't even know if my husband left a tip...",

How can it not be with its location only being a block or two away from Union Square, but if you need your quick fix of Guinness and corned beef and cabbage, look no further. How convenient this place is!  The food set up is interesting because it's cafeteria line style. That's the last thing I expected out of an Irish bar, but I guess it kind of \"tackily\" works. They make many freshly sliced deli meat sandwiches at lunch. The prime rib is served only at specific times, which is frustrating when you're craving meat.   Directly across from the cafeteria line, oddly enough, is a long ornate wooden bar. It's often hard to find a seat at this bar since many travelers find themselves quickly drinking a beer and leaving and it's not long before someone else snags that seat. If you walk further into the \"restaurant part\" of the pub at the end of the cafeteria line, there is a guy that'll help you find a seat at a booth or table. With tv's galore in this area, people spend mindless hours watching soccer and football games and drinking. It's dark inside so like a casino, you can lose track of time.   I don't know why but I find the tacky aspect of the setup entertaining, and sometimes you don't want to go to a restaurant that's Michelin rated. Sometimes you just want a beer and meat and buttered rolls. This will do that for you. Don't expect much more.",

Not only were we stared at consistently from the point we walked in to the point we left, but we were probably the only party consisting of people under 55. That being said, everyone ordered drinks as I went to the bathroom, and when I came back and sat down, the drink I had ordered was at my table. Before I could do anything, our \"server\", Celia, grabbed it out of my hand and demanded to see my I.D. I'm 25, and it's been a while since anyone has asked to see it, and I was taken off guard. I don't bring my I.D. Downtown most of the time because of horror stories I've heard of people getting mugged or losing them, and I didn't know we were going to a bar, so I left my ID safely at home. Now, I work at a restaurant downtown and I understand that she can't give me the drink if she thinks I look young, but she didn't question any of my friends, all of whom are younger than me. What bothered me was that from that point onward, she and the rest of the staff were incredibly rude to my friends and I, even telling us that we can \"get our own water\" when we asked for a glass of water. She also seemed extremely upset that none of us were ordering food. I know the proper procedure when someone doesn't have their ID and it's not to have a manager and all the staff stare you down as your friends are drinking, and it's definitely not to threaten your boyfriend who bought the drink while you were in the bathroom. Misunderstanding of epic proportions, my fault for not having my ID on me, but CELIA was unnecessarily rude to my friends (and she coulda made a pretty penny on that bar tab had we tipped her--fifteen people!) and it was because of her that we all left the bar after one drink. This place needs to better train their wait staff and fix their attitudes.",

Beers on tap include your usual fare, and I usually go for the Blue Moon or the Guiness. They also have a cafeteria on the right, which serves a hot meal in traditional pub-like manner. The prime rib dinner looks delicious. It's a good place for sports too, as a few flat screens line the bar tops. Old memorabilia also adorn the walls for those who are into baseball and of course, Lefty. On some nights, they have live music and others, karaoke.",

Food - One of my friends and I ordered the turkey dinner while my other friend ordered the corned beef. \u00a0The dinners are $10. \u00a0You also receive two hot sides, one cold side and a commercialized roll. \u00a0I ordered the mashed potatoes &amp; gravy and mac &amp; cheese as my sides. \u00a0My friend ordered the mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables with his corned beef. \u00a0The foregoing was a sign of things to come: \u00a0It was 7:30 on a Sat night and they had already run out of dark meat and prime rib (the kitchen stays open til midnight) - WTF?!?!  In summary, the food was \"Not Much\". \u00a0As in, there was \"Not Much\" food, there was \"Not Much\" flavor and there was \"Not Much\" anything I remembered: \u00a02 Stars.  Service - The waitress was pleasant but getting drinks was slow as F*ck! \u00a0The first order was a couple of beers and it took a good 15 min to get our drinks. \u00a0It was not that busy. \u00a0I ordered a cocktail for the second round and it took another 15 min. \u00a0Plus, the drink was weak!!! \u00a0The waitress apologized and I shook it off and put it on the bartenders: \u00a03 Stars for the waitress/2 Stars for the bartenders. \u00a0Combined rating: \u00a02.5 Stars.  Lefty's did have much \"Righty\" in my mind. \u00a0This place is a tourist trap and my friends who live locally should know that. \u00a0But I will give them a free pass because they recommended the Clift Hotel around the corner and it was a \"good\" time (please see my review later this week)...",

There were about five people at the bar. I ordered a Lagavulin 16 at which time the bartender informed me about how he didn't like that style of scotch (good thing I had asked him) he then gave me a sample of some Oban. I know my malts down to the lot numbers. These malts are a different style. What I hadI ordered was complex and filled with peat, what he gave me to try was an average malt that is sweet and for beginers. Next time, DO YOUR JOB and stick to what you know. However, breakfast is good here. I will never be back for anything other than breakfast. This place has grown with the tourism and is now to big for it's britches..... End result.....

I started to get the sense that dying liquids green is an American thing and the \"real\" Irish joints think that \"tradition\" is dumb. Whether this speculation is true or not, who cares. I did manage to get some Green Beer at Show Dogs on Market St. and that made me very happy since I've never drank green food coloring before.  So at Lefty's I pretty much just ordered a beer, sat in the back, enjoyed my drink, people watched, and then set out to find green beer. The cafeteria-style food looked pretty good--maybe I'll get some sometime.  Can't go wrong with randomly grabbing a beer at this centrally located Irish pub any time of the year (not just around St. Patrick's day where I bet they make like 100 times more than they usually do).",

This reminded me of what my middle school cafeteria would be if it served alcohol. \u00a0I'm not saying it's a bad concept. \u00a0I know it is a SF tradition. \u00a0It might even be passable if I had been wasted. \u00a0But I was neither a tourist nor had I consumed my weight in alcoholic beverages.  My man was super excited to go here for some cheap eats. \u00a0In the mood to not break the bank I agreed. \u00a0He must have been drunk when he was here last. \u00a0It was not good. \u00a0I stood in the very cafeteria-esque line and was served be a guy that just didn't appear clean enough to be handling my food without gloves (saw him wipe his nose. Ew.) \u00a0I should have just said no right then.  My ravioli and meat sauce was slapped onto a plate from a raised stream tray. \u00a0Sauce was slopped on from another. \u00a0My \"no cheese\" became piles of sawdust-like-I-hesitate-to-call-\"cheese\". \u00a0It came with a wild rice soup. \u00a0First major issue was that all items on my plate were luke warm. \u00a0The centers of my over cooked ravioli were pretty much room temp while I had a few that were actually cold. \u00a0Remember that meat sauce that resembled barf in the school lunches? \u00a0Yeah, that. \u00a0 \u00a0My soup was also an over cooked mess, I think I would have been better off with a canned soup...maybe it was canned?  My man had beef from the carving table. \u00a0He liked it well enough. \u00a0I thought it was dry and tough. \u00a0The boiled cabbage and potatoes were ok. \u00a0Just like KFC's sides are ok. \u00a0No better than that. \u00a0I could tell this was not how he had expected things to be. \u00a0  Irish pub Susan, not great food, get over it. \u00a0At least you get a stiff drink, the Irish love to drink! \u00a0Wrong. Everything was poured a light. \u00a0I'm not talking \"Dang, she unreasonable and just wants free booze.\" \u00a0No, like tiny wine glass with less wine in it than is ok. \u00a0Cranberry juice...oh wait it was supposed to have vodka? \u00a0When I asked if I could get some water from the waitress she said there was a water fountain. \u00a0Ok. \u00a0I'm not even buzzed (I mean tinnnny glass of wine) and I couldn't get the fountain to work. \u00a0I asked the bar tender for a glass of water. \u00a0I don't think I have ever gotten attitude from anyone when asking for a glass of water in my life...until now.  All of this topped off with a weird smell to the place...like too many drinks and food spilled and it has seeped into the cracks to constantly give off a distasteful odor. \u00a0Reminiscent of day old, damp, dirty mop. \u00a0Never the less, the pungent fragrance is easy to recall up writing this review and definitely did not make for a pleasant eating environment.  Now perhaps I came on a day when the food guy was sick, the bartender was hungover, and the cleaning staff had decided to strike, but overall I was pretty grossed out. \u00a0I was also very thankful I did not get sick. \u00a0Convenient cheap calories?

The person who seated us was nice enough, but the person who brought the water and OJ we ordered spilled some on the floor before getting to us and didn't bother to clean it up. We still stayed and ordered food. Third mistake.  I ordered a ham, mushroom, cheese omelette, my friend the Denver omelette and coffee. We both had home fries.  His coffee was grainy. The home fries were greasy, overcooked, and bland. The cheese in the omelette was more like cheese whiz. The waiter brought ketchup in a Heinz bottle. When I poured it, it came out like tomato sauce--clearly not Heinz. And it tasted horrible. When I asked for real Heinz, he brought little Heinz ketchup packets.

There, during my then-binge of vodka and tomato juice, I picked up a bottle of his bloody mary mix. This stuff is better than most pre-made hangover elixirs. Vodka need apply.  On our way towards a ramen shop near Union Square last night, we passed by Lefty's. We had to stop. It was fate that brought me here. Ramen noodles could wait another day. I had to go in, and I had to do it now.  The wood floors, wood bar, sports TVs and plaques on the wall tell me this place is easy to get along with, and I like that. To your immediate right as you enter, trays, silverware are there for you to grab and go. Just like lunch at the school cafeteria. Except that instead of a nice cafeteria lady, you have two monotone, overweight dudes in their 50s serving you your food. Hofbrau's of the 21st century... At one station, roasts of corned beef, turkey and beef brisket lay under heat lamps ready to carve. At the other, you get your stale roll and one choice of a side.  Although my order of corned beef and cabbage wasn't hot for long (probably because the roasts had been out, and/or the heat lamps weren't properly working), I appreciate that this place sticks to it's guns - and isn't going to change whether my corned beef gets cold or not. My German potato salad was standard, loaded with dill and chopped bacon. That, boiled potatoes, a quarter of boiled cabbage and a stack of corned beef cost me around $13. I can definitely see myself coming back, but only if I'm drunk and don't want to wait for my meal.  To say the least, this place was decent. But if it was fate that brought me there, I sure hope the future has better things in store.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fofftheechain.com&amp;s=fe6cb02bbf243e9f0e497225211b1b82d79f933ae18acd363b76bd3ebf772092\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">offtheechain.com</a>",

    "review_text": "This place is hilarious, as a vegetarian it wouldn't be my first choice but my friend can not get enough of their ginormous turkey enchiladas so in we roll. It's cafeteria style and the food reminds me of the boiled dinners of my childhood---cornbeef, cabbage, mushy veg---big portions--ok prices. I had the greek salad which was actually pretty good and good sized, at around $8 it should be. Staff are all characters and pretty much leave you alone. Interesting mix of clientele....",

I end up here when I'm touring friends around Union Square..  I end up here when i come home from a bar....  I end up here after a dinner...  And this always seems to be the spot for our last bar hopping spot....  Something about Lefty's... something about Lefty's....  Oh yah.. decent alcohol prices. Great Service.. Great management....  I mean..management is so freaking awesome they were able to stand us being loud and stupid and drunk.  I am not sure how many times I've gone out of this bar sober. oh duh. None.  That's Lefty's for ya.",

I came here the other night for dinner after the Union Square tree lighting. \u00a0And believe me, it was super busy. \u00a0The line just to get food was out the door!! \u00a0I am so glad that we got there at an apporpriate time because if we waited any longer to eat, we would've waited at least a good 30 to 45 mintues just to eat. \u00a0  The good thing about this place is they give priority to those who are line for food vs. those who are there just for drinks.  I usually just come here for their corn beef and oh how I love their corned beef. \u00a0Always super lean, which I like.  Service is always top notch here everytime we dine here.  Defintely will be back, but I will have to try something new.",

I also stopped in for a sandwich and a beer and found the corned beef to be lean and flavorful on a nice roll.",
