Been three times now and I must admit my goal is to try all the food on the menu as everything so far has been tasty, especially the fris\u00e9e aux lardons (best fris\u00e9e I've had so far actually) and the duck rillette baguette (a complex pate with great bread.) Attention to detail is the mainstay here as all the ingredients, especially the lettuces and veggies, have been of the highest quality. And in a typical French fashion, the servings aren't the largest but at least the dishes are healthy and beautifully presented. Be careful with the wine as the bill adds up really quick, hehe, and truthfully, I suspect there's not a bad bottle on the menu. Again, great to see more awesome spots popping up in Soma. Please let this be a role model for more future cafes. Sant\u00e9!",

The beautiful design of the place makes it easy for them to pull off the various formats so well as it feels like a intimate French cafe.   I came here for brunch. The French pressed coffee comes in a beautiful le creuset set that elevates the experience a little bit. The French omellete is well done but the standout is the frisee salad with lardon and eggs. Get the large size if you're hungry as that is really entree size. The egg is so rich and beauitfully cooked. The overall dish was very savory which is impressive cause often people make it too salty. The bread and butter side is excellent -- great piece of toast and very rich butter. Service is friendly and fast.   I'd come back to try dinner or wine but definitely would come by for breakfast in SoMa.",

    "review_text": "I liked Les Clos, and I enjoyed the food and wine I had here. This is a place that can get spendy very quickly though. \u00a0  The atmosphere was laidback. Something about the decor at Les Clos made it feel like a very upscale dive bar. Maybe it was the TVs streaming random old movies like Labyrinth.   There was certainly nothing divey about the menu though. Les Clos serves up a wide selection of items: wine, champagne, cocktails (without hard alcohol), sake, sherry, vermouth, madeira, Sightclass coffee, tea, American + European cheese, charcuterie, oysters, caviar, bread + pastries from Le Marais Bakery, Humphry Slocombe ice cream, and French-inspired appetizers + entrees. Most of the cheese, charcuterie, bread, and alcohol are available for purchase. Menu prices include tax already, which I thought was nice, even if only due to irrational perception rather than rational math.  The 2 of us shared: * Bread + butter - $2 * 1oz of Basquitou cheese - $3: I really liked the cheese. It was served with a bit of quince paste and bread. * Lobster bisque with gnocchi + sunchokes - $14: Every spoonful of this was amazing! * Frisee with lardons, soft egg, ver jus - $9 for a half portion * Escargot stew with koshihikare rice, sweet garlic, chervil - $24: The stew resembled a very green porridge. I'm not a big escargot fan, but I found this dish interesting. The rice was a bit mushy though.   I wasn't very hungry when I sat down for dinner, and I wasn't very full when I left. I'd recommend Les Clos for a snack or a light meal, but I think it'd be tough to gorge yourself here. All the food was beautifully plated on lovely ceramic dishes.   We each had several 3oz pours of wine. The staff provided good recommendations based on our descriptions of what we liked. The wines here are on the pricier side, with the 3oz pours of red wine ranging from $7 to $27.   I was impressed by the tea selection here. In particular, there was a selection of Pu-erh ranging from $10 (1999) to $150 (1938) for a pot. I went with the cheapest option. The grassy flavor was lovely. I appreciated that the servers paid attention to how the tea was served. They poured the tea into a 2nd pot to avoid over-steeping. They heated water and refilled the 1st pot only when I was almost done drinking from the 2nd pot. I had 3 pots of tea, but the leaves had enough flavor to last a few more pots. The pot would have been good for sharing.  Since Les Clos is open all day, I would definitely come back to hang out, snack, drink, and read in the afternoon.",

Similarly, my friend ordered the French omelet and it was also tiny, about 6\" long and 2\" wide, served with 4 petite slices of red potato. \u00a0Flavor and execution were totally fine, she was just still hungry afterwards. \u00a0We were both ready for bunch part deux immediately after eating at Les Clos. \u00a0  It's too bad, because the place is tr\u00e8s mignonne, the people are friendly, and they have the world's most comfortable bar stools. \u00a0I just think they should either decrease the prices or increase them and make the portions sizes more substantial.",

I was emailing someone, as I sat down with a friend for brunch, about Burgundy's little town I sometime call home, and he wrote back, \"j'y \u00e9tais all\u00e9 une fois en v\u00e9lo. Chouette.\" Then he asked me to text him a BTG. In a total amateur hour, I wrote back, \"ah, what's BTG?\" That, as he explained much later on, means \"by the glass.\" Great. So much for my sophstimacation!   Opened two months ago, Mr. Bright pays homage to his beloved Burgundy with lots of different wines from that region, including a wine map that prominently displays Beaune and Dijon, cities I'm familiar with.  Plus I'd go wherever Saison staffers go.  I had a rough weekend and this place was just what the doctor ordered: chic, foreign (yes, lots of French people), and familiar all at once. \u00a0Like most French wine bars, the tab water did not come with ice. French omelette was airy and tasty. Demi baguette was crunchy and fresh, and whatever my friend ordered, some sort of breakfast plate with soft boiled egg and ham was decidedly, French and yummy.  Here I was, sitting in this tastefully decorated wine bar, eating a proper brunch, catching a Wooden Allen flick, while discussing pre-race dietary needs with one of my super ultramarathoner friends and trying to stay distracted.   I told him the lowdown of the last few weeks, one event after another like there was no tomorrow. I was beginning to drown in work and life when I realized that the race date was coming to up. What should I eat for the next two weeks? I asked. He said, \"Eat healthy, sort of like this.\"  French food is not what I'd call \"healthy\" but it's superbly homey to me. \u00a0This place is through and through French-Californian. Jazz music was gently playing in the background. It was not loud, no one was yelling like most of those annoying restaurants are like. Then as I headed to the back side for the bathroom, I noticed something extraordinary: they have Olympic Provisions sausages and pates. I love OP in Portland. Separately, there are endless wines sitting on the rack, many are Burgundy reds. Tons of soft cheeses. Then there was the bathroom, which was filled with aromatherapy stuff - you really don't want to get out after going in, it's like a spa.  Here are a few things that I have noticed about San Francisco and SF food scene as of late:   1. There are a mass migration of French into this town. They are coming in troves.  2. French bistro theme is so in, any and every Michelin Star chef in town is opening up their own version of it: Urchin Bistrot, Monsieur Benjamin and now Les Clos.  3. Bathrooms smell like day spa - Waco in Inner Richmond is another example of it.   Trend setter aside, Les Clos offers something that you just don't see very much in more popular neighborhoods. Sophistication. This is not Plow, Bar Tartine, Mission Beach Cafe or Nopa. This is a place that you want to come when you miss France, really miss France, or perhaps your first casual online date, so that if the companion sucks, down the Sightglass coffee in 10 and you are out. If it does not suck, then order that charcuterie plate you are eying for. Always have an exit plan, and this restaurant will accommodate both!  But if you are like me and just want to find a less seen-and-be-seen place to chill with your friends? This is great too! Like Revolution Cafe, this place carries a sense of style and unique vibe. Do not miss.",

She's former of Saison and Hakkasan SF.   \u00a0 \u00a0 Les Clos is such a cute place serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Bread and pastries make fresh daily and so the rest of the food serve here is sustainable and locally sourced. \u00a0You can pick up cheese and food items togo here as well.    \u00a0 \u00a0A neighborhood spot, warm and inviting, good food and so reasonable wine mark up, hard to find wines, think of half \u00a0bottle Krug Champage is only $80, that's a retail price, no mark up! \u00a0Right now since they just grand-opening, pick up wines to go 30% shelf!    \u00a0 \u00a0 I'll be back for more.",

The food was ridiculous: roasted marrow \"canoe\" w/ caviar obviated the need to add salt, as the caviar took care of that. \u00a0But it was lacking on concept. \u00a02 good ingrediants don't make a great dish. \u00a0Next, 2 cheeses: a crottin/goat cheese and a \"petite\" {guess they don't really know french, as Camembert is a masculine noun) camembert, both served as if straight out of the refrigerator. \u00a0I would suggest they visit Gary Danko where the cheese tray is both beautiful, diverse and prepped at the correct (i.e. room) termperature. \u00a0  For dessert the rice pudding was quite nice, but it didn't make up for the 2 previous courses. \u00a0The service was ploddingly simple; the barman added nothing to the mix and seemed uneasily out of his depth. \u00a0  I can't see how the folks who run Saison could be so pitifully short-sighted in their attempt to create a sweet little winebar. \u00a0The concept is great, the achievement totally mediocre. \u00a0I hope they improve their food service, as it is a real offense to the wonderful wines they offer.",

Very chill/cozy vibe. \u00a0  We decided to get some food and coffee. \u00a0I ordered the corn meal waffle with currants and apples along with a pot of green tea. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered a cappuccino, a shot of espresso (geez how much caffeine can one have??), and Frise\u00e9 salad with a poached egg, chicken, and potatoes (I'm blanking on the real name). \u00a0Apparently, there was a malfunction with the order printer in the kitchen, so we waited a little while for our food, but honestly, we didn't notice! However, the server brought us 2 complimentary pastries. How nice!  My waffle was perfectly crunchy and the currant/apple toppings added some tang to the flavor. \u00a0At first, I thought the white dollop on top of the fruit was some fresh cream, but it was whipped butter! I took about half the dollop onto my fork, at it, and soon after realized what I had done. Whoops! My green tea was the perfect temp. That's all I have to say about that. *thumbs up*  My boyfriend's breakfast was superb! Very French dish. He's a French cuisine enthusiast and he was in complete awe with every bite that he took. \u00a0The chicken and poached egg were all cooked to perfection and the flavors were well balanced. \u00a0He also loved his cappuccino and shot of espresso. \u00a0I had a little taste of the espresso and it was a caffeine PUNCH to the face! TIME TO WAKE UP!  This is not your everyday brunch place. \u00a0The food focuses quality and not so much quantity. \u00a0If you're hungover and just want to stuff your face with mountains of pancakes and bacon, this isn't the place. May I recommend iHop?   Overall, great service, food, and vibe. \u00a0I will definitely be coming back here again!!  **BONUS! This place has the swankiest bathroom. Forget paper towels.

    "review_text": "3.5 STARS  If last week's news is any indicator of how the year will play out, then 2015 will be one kick ass year! It was surreal when I heard that the ban had been lifted on my beloved foie gras. It felt like winning the lottery, better yet, having perky t*ts that don't point to my toes.   Les Clos is one of the handful of restaurants in SF that immediately added foie gras on their menu the very same night the ban had been lifted so we paid a visit over the weekend.  Opening last fall, Les Clos is a casual French Bistro &amp; Wine Bar that was started by several Saison alums. It's impressive the hours they keep; they're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Les Clos accepts reservations which Yelp needs to update under their business info.   Les Clos' menu has Le Marais pastries, salads, sammies, oysters, cheeses, charcuterie, and three entrees at dinner. The menu changes seasonally and prices are more in the $$$ range than what yelp indicates: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BpPa9H&amp;s=dd815876daa24be0ec81c4b4eecb4d79943dec6b7f55fdf01d63e6a7ecfcf225\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1BpPa9H</a>. They have an extensive wine list with over 40 glasses of wine by the glass. It's rather expensive though. For reds, 3 oz pours are $11-$16. I'm a total wine noob so I don't remember the name but our waitress recommended a great French blend (malbec and merlot) which was delicious and bold but at $26 a glass (6 oz pour was more 5 oz), it was damn pricey.   We started out with the Foie Gras Torchon (large - $29): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1IK9piO&amp;s=59c14c659a859a161b75df833879e427fa5c3ad80b35c13235532524416281d5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1IK9piO</a>. I usually prefer seared foie over a torchon but this was by far the best torchon I've had. It was ridiculously silky with a cured sweetness that was pure ambrosia between the lips. Paired with their freshly baked parker rolls (same one I had at Saison), it was out of this world...BOMB!  Sadly, the food went downhill after that. We also ordered the Bone Marrow for an app; one plain ($5) and one with caviar ($16): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1sy7njI&amp;s=1f624f4965834373ea5a5b5f2f94efaf329c88a54f3e44678cd5a7eb034736b3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1sy7njI</a>. The marrow was pale and was in need of seasoning. Caviar and marrow sounded luxuriously good on paper but it just made the marrow taste fishy.   For my main, I ordered the Poulet Basquez w/ cous cous ($26): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xZiMcI&amp;s=ef2dec947946eb852e2fe8519ae2ea7afa27760e6a97e005df7fc2740e64ebb4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1xZiMcI</a> which is Les Clos' take on a Moroccan Chicken Tagine. I was surprised with the large portion of chicken (2 thighs and 2 drumsticks) but it was dry and bland. It definitely lacked robust spices (ginger, cinnamon, cumin) and dried fruit that a solid tagine would have.  Mr. NSS ordered the Lamb Shank w/ rye spatzle, maitake, sauerkraut ($29): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F151Tu2q&amp;s=d0a73aaf8be9058d131b4ed5401c97eb9ce51afef04469b6b0fe7060f4791e45\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/151Tu2q</a> which was beautifully presented. We wrongly assumed that the lamb shank would be braised. The lamb was served too rare and was very chewy in the center. The toasted rye sp\u00e4tzle was very addictive though.  Redeeming our lackluster entrees was the Les Clos Sundae ($10) which consisted of two scoops of Humphry's Taihitian vanilla ice cream, melted dark chocolate, chantilly cream, and candied pine nuts: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1B1mpS0&amp;s=d6b6f592d50376ac84457927aec55aa857bcbb6accb1fd5c68360dbc27172694\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1B1mpS0</a>. Every component was simple but together it was delicious grown up sundae (not too sweet). Loved the sweet, buttery crunch from the candied pine nuts.   Service was welcoming, sweet, and attentive. Food service was very timely. We were in and out in less than 75 minutes, and we ate a very leisurely rate.   Les Clos is great for laptop camping in the day while sipping on a Sightglass latte, a casual, romantic date at night, or enjoying a night cap on their plushy leather couch. There's two flat screen TV's at the bar area. Not good for parties larger than 4.   Finding street parking was easy since it's not baseball season and we eat dinner like AARP members.",

Cheese plate: parmesan, Mt. Tam, and Harbison, with warm bread and jam spreads. \u00a0I was a big fan of the latter two, but then again, I have always preferred soft cheeses. Market greens: crunchy but too much oil on the leaves; average. Lobster bisque: very rich and flavorful, but heavy on the stomach. \u00a0Ditto for pommes aligot, or very smooth (pur\u00e9ed?) mashed potatoes with cheese. \u00a0So unhealthy, but so delicious. Escargot stew: green pesto rice with some white sauce and an occasional snail inside. \u00a0I was not a fan of this dish because it was too salty for my taste. \u00a0 Squash side dish: the cardamom seeds lent an excellent taste to the excellently cooked squash. \u00a0  Overall, I would recommend the cheese plate, the bisque, and the squash. \u00a0Given that this is only half of the dishes and the fact that it came at a very expensive price, I have to dock 1.5 stars. \u00a0The service was extraordinarily good, I loved the atmosphere, and I'm sure the wine selection is excellent, but in terms of food Les Clos still has a ways to go.",

I say 'unexpected' because I keep presuming places like this are in neighborhoods like Nob Hill and Pac Heights where the snootiness quotient is much higher. Not that long ago but well before the recent wave of gentrification, I believe the dining pinnacle of Mission Bay could be found at the McDonald's at 3rd and Townsend. But now, there are pricey places like Alexander's and Saison that would melt the numbers off my credit card. Speaking of which, Saison's wine director Mark Bright must be aware there are proletarians like me and Jamie W. in the 'hood and opened Les Clos to cater to pocketbooks with less platinum in them like ours.  We came on a Saturday afternoon where it looked like we gratefully just missed a wave of customers. The menu is an endless spiral clipboard of delights that strives to balance wine, beer, coffee and food according to their website. Although they have loads of libations, flights of tantalizing wine and crates of craft beers, we were drawn to the mimosas in the smallish cocktail section of the menu. Jamie ordered the $8 White Ale Mimosa, a nice elixir from the Allagash Brewery in Portland, ME mixed with orange juice and bitters (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1AwWO1i&amp;s=0d2c55c50850d9a8df5178bb1e8dff382f3c7d945c0c6cd7a79ed02c7bc3bfd4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1AwWO1i</a>).

Very refreshing with just a tinge of gas. Since we were peckish, we looked for appropriate-size noshes.  Luckily it was just a hair past 2:30PM, so we could take advantage of their brunch menu (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1CmSIuP&amp;s=4624252173d396a80b812e8ffc56d6c1d865046e052e1b14b4d1d525bec2ee5e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1CmSIuP</a>). Jamie decided on the $12 French Omelette, a classic rendition with chorizo, shallots and Cabot Clothbound cheddar cheese served with sauteed potatoes (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xaoutT&amp;s=af889e230ef603af63026dd327d84e892e392b93a7737d32dd696bdddd8c54b2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1xaoutT</a>). You could tell the egg whites were beaten to stiff peaks to attain that requisite airiness. I ordered the $14 Croque Madame with a perfectly shaped fried egg on top of jambon de Paris between crusty pain accompanied by a small mixed salad (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xaoytn&amp;s=35ec11340c0e40a220cceb6c1fa08ddcce7b6babd4389a1059fdc7c5747d7244\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1xaoytn</a>). Just the perfect afternoon bite. Jamie couldn't help himself when he saw they served Humphry Slocombe ice cream, so he had a $4 single scoop of his favorite, Secret Breakfast (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1sZqDXD&amp;s=ba4f28df35f8c2dfa36adc4409ab55909ca65082dc883d4d20a7de2e476c69de\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1sZqDXD</a>).

I can't believe I didn't know about this place -- it's around the corner from my office. \u00a0I was actually reluctant to go inside at first (my default cafe was closed, and this was on the way back); glad I did.  Great food, wine, and ambiance. \u00a0Works as a casual cafe or for more substantial lunch or dinner. \u00a0Probably not a great choice if you're on a diet, but otherwise excellent.  So far I've only tried the between-lunch-and-dinner cafe service, so I'll have to update once I've been to lunch and dinner.",

Tonight I tried out their dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the simple French fare. Wonderful cheese selection, incredibly detailed wine tasting options, and lots of sharing plate options.  I was especially impressed with their mussel and saffron stew which was more like a French risotto with mussels, fennel, onions, and flavorful saffron.  Service is attentive, prompt and knowledgeable. Yes, it is rather pricey but portions are quite generous and the ambiance was cozy and intimate without being too loud on a Saturday night.",

FOOD &amp; DRINKS: \u00a0We had champagne, oysters, Foie Gras and a charcuterie board- \u00a0Every bite was excellent- the Foie was the main reason we picked Les Clos and it did not disappoint. \u00a0We will go back for the Foie gras.  ATMOSPHERE: casual sort of bistro like  SERVICE: \u00a0friendly, informative and attentive  PARKING: pretty hard to find-take public transit or a cab   The only tiny aspect that could have been better were the bar stools. \u00a0Not very comfortable.",
