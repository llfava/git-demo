    "review_text": "I loved Silver Linings Playbook. Wait, that's the movie (I did love it though). State Farm Prudential? Nope, insurance companies. State Bird Provisions...that's the name of the restaurant!  When I first heard about it, I kept forgetting the name, so up until our visit my girlfriend and I kept amusing ourselves with various versions we thought the restaurant name sounded like. I could go on, but I won't. And rest assured, the food was no joke.  Although there is a standard food menu, what makes this place truly unique is the pay-as-you-go dim sum style small plates that the servers carry/roll around. Whereas in dim sum it's fairly easy (for me at least) to pace myself and not over-order, it's nearly impossible here. BECAUSE EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. How much do I order from the menu? Do I get one or two orders from this cart when I know more is still to come? Do I have room for dessert? WHERE ARE YOU STAN?? I'M IN A GLASS CASE OF GLUTTONY!!!  Whoa. Lost my composure there. Apologies.  Now on to the food. I'm not going to go over everything we ate, because as evidenced by our bill, we practically ordered everything. I will say, the highlights were the peking duck, the pork, the hamachi nori, and the ribs. And I'm not even a big fan of ribs, but they were fall of the bone tender. So glorious.  One issue I had is with our service. Our waiter wasn't rude, he was just...weird. Everything he did was at inopportune times and he was clearly not amused by anything we were saying. I know this place serves food dim sum style, but I wasn't expecting the service to be similar to those restaurants as well. Whatever, it wasn't enough to dampen the overall experience, as all the other servers who brought around the provisions were nice and welcoming, and the food was delicious, of course.  I can't wait to return to this place. But it will have to be in two months (at the earliest) because this place is already booked through then. The place is small, so unless you want to wait for hours, reservations are the way to go. One final shout out to the earl grey ice cream sandwich. A delicious end to a great meal.",

    "review_text": "Loved loved this place.  My friend called in the morning and suggested we go there that night (it was Friday) She said she would get in line at 5pm. I have seen the lines forming earlier than that \u00a0- and said I would get in line at 4:30. I arrived at 4:35 and was the 5th party in line. The guy at the very front of the line got there at 4:10 pm. (when His party arrived there were like 8 of them). \u00a0  At about 5:25 someone comes out and asks if anyone has a reservation they should come to the front of the line and they are seated (there were very few 5:30 reservations). At 5:30 the line was about 25 parties line by my guesstimation. \u00a0I believe the way it works is they seat as many of the line that they can, they give the rest of the people in line a TIME to come back and be seated. This is actually fair b/c I have heard that some computer geeks have rigged the reservation system and hog all the reservations (to sell them?)  Our party of 3 got right in. We had a great table right by where the food comes out. I'm \u00a0the gal at the cocktail party who figures out where the food comes out and stands there for first pick!  I took photos of everything we had EXCEPT the sauerkraut pancakes (which I did love) \u00a0I did not partake in the seafood options (but my friends did) \u00a0If I had to \"Sophie's choice\" it it would be the rabbit with the spetzle. \u00a0But the fried quail, and the quail dumpling were also amazing. And sadly we only had room for 1 dessert which we loved.   Funny story - there was a kid (about 12 years old) in line in front of us with his Dad (Mom joined the line later). It was his 3rd time there! - they ended up at the table next to us and the kid was recommending what we should order off the regular menu. This Kid was chowing down, he ate the bone marrow, the caviar, fun kid (and I'm generally not a fan of kids AT ALL) - but this kid was so foodie-centric he won my cold bitter heart.  We had one bottle of wine to split and one of us had a cocktail - we were stuffed and the bill (with tip) was about $210. Not a bad deal considering,  My friend had now hired me as her \"line pimp\" for when her family is in town. I will secure a spot in line for her and they might buy me dinner. Sounds like a plan to me.  As an added bonus - here is a adorable video of the owners making their favorite midnight snack at home - sauerkraut and pecorino tacos. \u00a0 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Def7UxzINkn4&amp;s=9a6fa5a42f04af04d12377d4de8d60fae73015a7189b63a2d5b505eb3af71081\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/watch?v=ef7U\u2026</a>",

One of my girlfriends managed to get us a reservation for 4 (over a month in advance) and I heard so much hype and positive reviews on this place that I flew up to San Francisco to try it for myself.  End result: worth every penny.  It's really a great place -- the whole \"dim sum\" spin on things is truly brilliant. While the food was delicious, the whole dining experience is really what made everything memorable. It's just a great little space to go to with a bunch of friends and just hang out and eat (and eat, and eat).   I can honestly say that we didn't pass up any dish that came by the table. Everything looked so beautiful and tasted as good as it looked. Needless to say we quickly ran up our tab, but like any dim sum place, it's better to go with a large group so you have the opportunity to try more items.  Like most people say on here -- order the CA State Bird when you go. It's a must and it's damn good.",

We were seated promptly, and the service all night was friendly, warm, and fast. \u00a0The atmosphere is casual, cozy, and inviting. \u00a0We both ordered from the offered menu as well as took offerings from the small plates that came around (dim sum style). \u00a0By the end of the night, we all had the feeling that we had tried a large array and variety of dishes without being extraordinarily stuffed.  The great thing is that we all agreed that all of the dishes were good with a handful of real standouts including: steak tartare sunchoke toast, chanterelle toast, heart of palm salad, smoked trout-avocado 'chip &amp; dip', and quinoa-cauliflower tabouleh. \u00a0The CA state bird with provisions was good, but we thought definitely not the highlight of the meal. \u00a0We also had two desserts (quince granita, coconut tapioca, persimmon and lemon curd 'ice cream' sandwich, chocolate macaron, cardamom meringue, cashew), both of which were good, but once again not standout.  Overall, a unique and delicious dinner with excellent service that (surprisingly) didn't empty our wallets in the least. \u00a0I can't wait to come back and try more of what they have offer!",

    "review_text": "I went to State Bird yesterday fully expecting to be underwhelmed. I had, after all, done my research, and everyone said the place was overhyped.  I thoroughly disagree. I had a fantastic time, and I highly recommend this spot to serious diners in SF.  To get the awkward part out of the way: yes, there is a wait, and yes, it's absurd. There is, however, a way to beat it. Come in early (~5.30pm) on a Mon-Wed, get your name down, and spend time at Dosa's bar or the Wine Jug with some cocktails. We waited about an hour.   Next, the service. I was expecting the staff's pretentiousness to match the restaurant's hype. This was absolutely not the case. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating, including the head chef, who was so wonderful (I'd come back just to say hi to him!)  Finally, the food. As you've probably gleaned from your Yelp research thus far, it is all dim sum style, but they do have a menu too.   We mostly stuck with dim sum because we were too full to order off the menu after a few small plates. My reccos:  Hamachi-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker - SOOOO GOOD! Don't do yourself an injustice....eat the cracker WITH the hamachi, it's amazing!  Buratta garlic bread - UNBELIEVABLE. It was more pastry and less bread. Forget your guilt. It's worth ordering  Octopus - one of the best octopus dishes I've had. It was a charred octopus with some sort of chikpea salsa and simply phenomenal  Egg white kimchi - what a novel dish! it's veggie-friendly and had a wonderful texture while still maintaining the authentic kimchi taste  Oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut - YUM.  Quinoa - I LOVE quinoa so I liked this dish, but it wasn't anything crazy. Good texture - soft and crispy, but again, nothing wow-worthy  Ribs - the only thing we ordered off the menu, and though I don't eat ribs, these were apparently good, but nothing great.   Yes, it's embarrassing that we didn't order the state bird. Apparently, it's epic. Order that.  Finally: THE DESSERT. We had a lovely chocolate macaron ice cream sandwich with a pecan streusel. The chef was nice enough to give us peanut muscovado milk on the house with this....and the combination of the two was sinful, amazing, and heavenly. MUST ORDER.",

    "review_text": "I really don't know what all the hype is about. \u00a0My sister convinced me to be nice and not factor in the hype when rating SBP, thus the 3 stars. \u00a0I'd say it's more like a 2.5.  I made reservations 2 months ago to get into this place, since it seems impossible to do so any other way. \u00a0My brother, sister, and I had a nice sibling dinner at 9pm on a Saturday. \u00a0  Let me start by saying this: the food is good, not great. \u00a0Generally tastes pretty good but nothing really stood out (ie. mind = not blown). \u00a0The nori chips that we got off the cart (with shrimp/avocado) and the fried qual were the only things that are really worth talking about. \u00a0The meatballs with some sweetbreads was pretty good too. \u00a0As for creativity in food, pork belly w/ kimchi, fry bread with burrata, and porcini muchroom spread on flatbread aren't exactly ground breaking foods. \u00a0Call me a food snob, but I wasn't really wowed by these dishes. \u00a0They tasted good, but weren't amazing, and the pork belly was slightly overcooked (how that even happens I'm not even sure).  What really bothered me about SBP was the whole concept of this \"dim sum\" style dining. \u00a0The wait for this place on a given evening is so damn long because diners are sitting around waiting for the next dish to come out. \u00a0When the servers tell you there are about 12-15 dishes offered via cart or tray each evening, you'll likely want to hang around to see what all of those dishes are. \u00a0We were there nearly 2 hours and probably saw 8 or so of those dishes. \u00a0  The cart only carries about 3-4 dishes, meaning you're waiting for ~10 additional dishes to come rotating out via tray. \u00a0Problem is, they rotate a tray dish probably every 15 minutes or so, so you're literally waiting the entire time, nibbling on a tiny plate of food, then waiting again. \u00a0Unless you're ordering a bunch of food off the printed menu, you're going to be sitting at your table with maybe 1 or 2 plates at a time. \u00a0People want to know what all the dishes are, so they will wait, and that means, my friend, you will wait outside until I am done.  Basically, I think the entire operation is completely inefficient and given that most of the food is just average, I'm generally surprised at all the hype this place has been getting.",

It allows you to try many dishes, and keeps the excitement going because you don't know what's coming out next. It's been too long that I don't remember all the dishes, but the garlic bread burrata, pork belly , and coconut bao still stick out. With two beers for me and two glasses of wine for my wife (and at least 10 dishes), the total (after tip) was $175. Definitely an expensive night out for us but it was worth the food and experience.  The only reason I'm deducting one star is towards the end of the meal I was interested in seeing what else there was to eat. Several repeats had already come by, but around 8:30 (the restaurant closes at 9) the carts seemed to stop coming by, and they were just trying to sell what they already had made. I guess it makes sense, but it was disappointing that the kitchen stopped producing new dishes before closing, while people were still actively eating.",

There was so much food that I ordered that I can't list out for you all, but here are the ones that made an impression on me: CA State Bird with Provisions, garlic bread with burrata, duck fried rice, roasted bone marrow, crispy pork belly. I recommend trying all the tapas they have to offer!  I was so full by the end of dinner. I don't think my stomach was sitting well either because of the richness of the food.

My favorite dishes: Duck liver mouse - this creamy mouse is served with soft, fluffy almond biscuits. Smoked trout parfait with uni slaw - this dish is smoky and flavorful. Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancakes - the pancakes are served warm and the sauerkraut seasoning takes it to another level. Garlic bread with burrata - the bread is fried, then topped with buttery cheese and cracked pepper. 1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs - this tasty dish is served in a mini cast iron skillet with farro, green olive salsa verde and persimmon. Melon granita with tapioca pudding - this dessert is refreshing and slightly sweet.  The staff works as a team and they are all very attentive and knowledgeable. \u00a0The last time I went here. my friend and I sat at the chef's counter. \u00a0In addition to shucking oysters, he check in with us a few times and made some great recommendations. \u00a0  They have a great wine list. \u00a0The servers have always given me good guidance on what to try.",

    "review_text": "ah state bird provisions. \u00a0first off id like to say that when a restaurant gets this much hype (best new restaurant in america, 2 month ahead reservations) the expectations skyrocket. \u00a0with great reputation comes great responsibility  of course we made the reservations online about two months in advance. \u00a0our slot was at 7:30. \u00a0previously i had actually gotten some reservations but they were at 10:30. \u00a0who the heck eats at 10:30? they were super accommodating when we called ahead to arrange a table that could take a baby carrier as well. \u00a0their largest tables are 4.   we sit down at a table in the far back and our table is freezing! \u00a0so cold i had to put on my jacket at the end. \u00a0not sure if it was cuz the vents were right above us? \u00a0  the decor was cute. \u00a0i loved it. \u00a0just mismatched things here in there. string and pegboard walls. \u00a0colorful abstract veggie cutouts. \u00a0exposed beams, concrete walls.  when we walked in the kitchen is right there and everyone greets you. \u00a0kind of nice and welcoming. \u00a0service is ok. \u00a0i think most of the people who are bringing the food around are in a rush or something. \u00a0sometimes when they brought stuff around. i felt really rushed to make a decision.  i have to agree that the concept is novel for american food and that is the main draw here. \u00a0there are drawbacks to carting around the food. \u00a0there is a reason why most dim sum restaurants in hong kong dont offer the carts anymore: \u00a0space. \u00a0there isnt enought space. \u00a0and such is the case here. \u00a0when we walked in we waited by the door for a while because there was a cart being wheeled in the narrow entrance corridor/bar. \u00a0another thing is that when dim sum is getting wheeled around, those carts have steamers/heaters in them. not here. \u00a0so most of the food that we got off the cart was not hot. \u00a0on cold days, i want hot food.  ok onto the food. \u00a0in general i thought dishes were inventive but the taste was not stellar. \u00a0from the menu we ordered (of course) the state bird/fried quail, uni pancake, and also the trout. i have to admit ive never been a fan of quail but this was decent. \u00a0it was piping hot, brined?, breaded, and deep fried. \u00a0the meat was tasty and moist. \u00a0crunchy and soft textures.  to save space here ill just list out what we got off the carts/trays and comment: duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - liver was mild, biscuit was sweet sherry glazed smoked potato with tonnato - good! smoked fish spread shrimp, avocado, nori - nori was deep fried until crispy. \u00a0all else was kind of ... blah garlic bread with burrata - deep fried bread. \u00a0love burrata steak tartare with grilled broccoli &amp; shishito \u00a0- flavors of veggies were better than the tartare kimchi-pork belly with tofu - sour? \u00a0not a fan cheesecake japonaise, huckleberries, candy cap - def japanese influences. \u00a0delicious plum jam 'ice cream' sandwich, chocolate &amp; fennel - also delicious. \u00a0mix of textures.  i have to admit the flavors are not harmonious. \u00a0sometimes they dont go together. \u00a0sometimes they seem off. \u00a0maybe as the restaurant evolves, this will improve. \u00a0not sure.",

    "review_text": "Sharing small plates is a favorite way to dine, and this restaurant has been one of the best experiences for that so far. With small dishes that are about 4-6 bites each you can try a large portion of the fairly large menu if you bring some friends. Between four people we shared 22 different items and weren't overly full at the end of the evening. Some dishes were very tasty, some were interesting, some were underwhelming. With such a variety and large volume it is expected that not everyone will like every dish, but that's the great thing about this style of dining, you can just move on to something else.  The price is very reasonable for what you get. If you don't drink you can walk out for $50/person. For the price of each dish the best strategy is just to say \"yes\" to everything they bring out. My favorite taste for the evening was the chanterelle toast, simple and very satisfying, only $3.  They have quite a good wine list as well. One page, front and back, with about a third of the wines available by the glass. It covers all the bases and has some pretty interesting choices on it. The staff is also very knowledgeable and helpful about making selections. Unfortunately it is beer and wine only.  Overall, a great way to spend a couple hours with a small group of friends.",

Reservations are basically impossible to get a this point, so my lady and I put our name in around 6:30pm on a Friday night and were told we'd be looking at a 10pm seating. That was fine with us, and we headed out into the night to enjoy some wine and cards over at Social Study.   We got our seating call earlier than expected, and were seated with menues around 9:45pm--a late dinner to be sure, but worth the wait!  As vegetarians, we were a little nervous but shouldn't have been: we ate the eff out of that restaurant:  - Garlic bread with baked in burrata - Hummus and pita - Quail egg hash  I also broke the vegetarianism and ate two oysters with pickled jalepe\u00f1o. We enjoyed pistachio/strawberry ice cream sandwiches for dessert.   But by far the best part of the evening was the waitress delivering our ros\u00e9 champagne with squeeling, \"pink bubbly!\" with obvious delight.   Service was excellent, as expected. The unexpected part for me was the price: entirely reasonable for a splurge! If you eat a lot of the small dishes, they do add up, but if you keep yourself in check, you can get out for about $40/person, including alcohol and tax/tip.  Take aways: - Resign yourself to eating late and just put your name in at the beginning of the night - Come hungry",

Dim-sum concept will please everyone but sometimes they get a tad aggressive with the delivery. Still, better to have a duplicate dish than spontaneous table fight over a spoonful of tantalizing, umami-packed goodness! Every time I've come here over the last few years the menu has always changed. The best suggestion: go with your gut... any dish no matter how unique--think pancake w/powdered sauerkraut--is going to be outstanding. Only real question is when to stop? A restaurant is most divine and sacred during it's first incarnation. Case in point, Slanted Door and even Bar Crudo. Even with the recent remodel, the vibe at State Bird has been kept close to its core. I am thankful for that.",

Started the meal with duck liver mousse w/ almond biscuits, the favor was light, clean and crisp. The sweet almond biscuit made a good contrast of favor and texture.   Unfortunately it was the only good dish for the night...  Other dishes ordered were salmon tartare, oysters on half shell (which they ruin by adding some pickled reddish on top), smoked trout dip w/ chips, state bird with provisions, duck ham, garlic bread and air dried beef.   The dishes were well crafted but the favor was overpowered by the seasoning (they were all too salty). As a result, the natural favor of the ingredient didn't stand out and that was a pity.   Service and ambience was good, as expected for such a talked about restaurant like SBP. But there was just something missing in the food, overall it was an underwhelming experience.",

We stopped midway through the meal b/c everyone was kinda disappointed with the food. The food wasn't bad at all and was well prepared and unique w/fresh ingredients. None of the dishes stood out either. We didn't get to the dessert, but they looked tasty. We ended up going to Sophie's crepes to fill our tummys. Friendly service.

Only one party among the long line had a reservation and I bet it was probably hard to get. Anyways onwards to the food and service. They do the dimsum service wherein they bring trays of food to your table and explain to you the composition of each dish and tell you the price. They also have a menu for the dishes that isnt part of the \"serving trays\". They change their menu often. My friend went there just last month and they had a completely different set of food. Their portions are very tiny so it tends to get pricey if you have a very empty stomach.  I tried a few of their meat dishes.

    "review_text": "Textural synergy.  Dish after delicious dish, I couldn't help but notice a mastery of this concept and really...it wasn't until near the end of me and my brother's epic meal that the term dawned on me.  Having just finished renovations to expand the main dining area, I immediately fell head over heels for the eclectic layout of a space that vaguely resembles a child's wood shop...in the best way possible. \u00a0Tables and booths were both surprisingly spacious and there was nary a sense of confinement even with the servers constantly roaming the walkways. \u00a0Speaking of which, these staff members provided some of the most jovial and enthusiastic service I've ever experienced. \u00a0These folks presented their dishes with such passion that one would almost think they cooked it themselves.  While I quickly realized that it was folly to make note of the ingredients in the fourteen \"provisions\" we ordered, every single one had a tasty combination of flavors and textures to offer. \u00a0But who says I can't try? \u00a0Roasted nori with hamachi, salmon tartare, steak tartare with potato chips, oysters and chilled crab all contributed to a crunchy and refreshing start to the meal. \u00a0Moving towards fried fare, duck and cheese croquettes exploded with savory, fatty goodness. \u00a0Likewise, lightly crisped pork belly killed it with its lipid-laden glory and...wait for it...grapes, basil leaves and red chili peppers. \u00a0In fact, I'd even recommend eating just those latter ingredients for a clean, slightly herbacious and sweet bite with a hit of capsaicin on the finish!  Those pancakes. \u00a0Holy hell. \u00a0Leave it to Chefs Brioza and Krasinski to serve Mendocino sea urchin atop a wonderfully pillowy ginger-scallion pancake. \u00a0Then came the smoked sturgeon atop what appeared to be a rice pancake adorned with every ancient grain imaginable. \u00a0Crazy delicious especially when eaten with the accompanying jam and cheese spread.  From the \"commandables\", everything will be hella (yup) delicious if the cast iron quail eggs and roasted bone marrow were even remotely accurate representations of the quality and ingenuity. \u00a0Each bite of the eggs was as if I was munching on delicately soft white and yolk...laid in a garden...with an apple that dropped from a tree. \u00a0Never would have thought that each of ingredients would contrast yet simultaneously harmonize so well together. \u00a0As for the fatty globs of undifferentiated cells, they erupted with an other worldly richness of umami and earth that was simply astounding. \u00a0Combine this with the superlative bread that achieved toasty yet spongy equilibrium and you have the best marrow ever.  And finally, the sweets. \u00a0\"You're crazy if you don't try the birdseed,\" said one of the servers. \u00a0No joke, son! \u00a0My brother ordered seconds of this on his previous visit and for good reason: the caramel cloud (of the heavens) cream provided a nearly unparalleled softness that held in the chocolate crunch's full caramel, hazelnut and pecan flavors so that they could all blanket the palate at once towards each spoonful's finish. \u00a0The apple &amp; vanilla granita, coconut-carrot cake and hefty chocolate macaron 'ice cream' sandwiches all offered uniquely tasty forms of sweetness as well. \u00a0I especially enjoyed the granita's exceptionally cool and refreshing flavors while the sandwiches' accompanying yogurt spread contrasted perfectly with the chocolate's richness.  By the end, this effectively 22-course behemoth of a meal left me with the undoubted conclusion that State Bird has taken over as my #1 restaurant to date. \u00a0It was an absolute joy to experience such creative and exceptionally well-executed cuisine that incorporated both traditional structuring and influences from Chinese dim sum in a playful, inviting atmosphere full of great minds and personalities.",

I'm sure the wait is ridiculous on the weekend, but during the week, it's not a bad deal.  The interior is quirky. The servers are playful. The food is amazing.  First, there is a menu that you can order from. They have pancakes and main dishes. You can order these at any time and are meant to share. The real spectacular part is that servers walk around with food dim sum style.   Things I've had here: - Salmon Tartare - Duck mousse and almond biscuits - Ravioli soup thing - \"Buffalo\" cauliflower - Quinoa salad - Oysters (best I've ever had, hands down) - Rabbit and spaetzel - Rabbit and fontina croquettes - Steak tartare and homemade potato chips - Garlic Bread with burrata  The only thing that I didn't love was the garlic bread.

Good but I wouldn't order again.   - Duck Liver confie: delicious. Tasted even better with the bread for the bone marrow  - Bone Marrow: the highlight was the bread   - Halibut \"constructible\" tartar: amazing   - Raw Oysters  - Pork Belly: favorite dish, perfectly salted.   - Dessert: we ordered the apple bread pudding with faiche and this coconut tapioca with thai tea.

Reasonable price \u00a0considering it's a Michelin star restaurant.   60 more days....",

We snagged reservations 60 days in advance, and I am glad we did because I saw the walk-in line.... looked brutal.  Favorites: 1. duck liver mousse with almond biscuit 2. sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancake (the sauerkraut salt was incredible! I wish I could buy some to put on everything...) 3. CA state bird with provisions 4. ricotta dumplings with spring onion &amp; sunflower seeds  Other notables: 1. chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich with cherries 2. guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth 3. raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame 4. lobster with corn &amp; green coriander  Probably wouldn't recommend: 1. balsamic roasted figs with fondue 2. garlic bread with burrata  That was all the food we ordered for 2 people. Plenty... With a blackberry limeade, the total was $80 before tip. Not bad at all! Will definitely be back.",

    "review_text": "So many reviews already I guess there isn't much I can add..highly reviewed on yelp and you can find so much written on this place.. \u00a0I would say definitely try it out because this place makes eating fun and it doesn't hurt that the food is pretty good. This is basically a Dim Sum style/tapas/ hors d'oeuvres kinda place where you have an array of items (usually they say 13 things or so) passed around on trays and carts (average 5-9 dollars?). Then you have some things you can order off a selection from the menu (7-25 dollars but you can choose from half or full order).  I loved the: sweet corn and chives pancakes (off the menu), the glazed pork ribs, pork belly w/kim chee  I could pass on the: oysters, seafood salsa, corn thing with salmon and oxtail curry  Would of loved to try the: CA state bird with provisions (which I heard was what they are famous for?), cast iron eggs, burata garlic bread, peanut milk shot and ice cream sandwhich..I was too full already.  I loved the concept of small plates parading through you because I felt I was able to try a little bit of everything...and that I was content.  The place is super small with the open kitchen that greets you up front..it can be a bit crowded with the bar like sitting area surrounding the front open kitchen and people waiting along the side...I went in and was a bit lost to find the hostess.  The staff were all warm and friendly..I felt very comfy and at home.  This is probably not a good place for a romantic first date but definitely set a warm, casual, upbeat atmosphere if that's what you are looking for. \u00a0Great place with friends but maybe not a big group. The place overall is pretty small..I didn't really see any tables that could accommodate more than 4-6..  I made a reservation about 3 weeks prior (the only time was I believe 9:30p.m.)...which I actually forgot about until they called me the day of. \u00a0I don't know how hard it is to make a reservation now..but I highly recommend it although I did see a lot of walk in's and the wait was about 20-30..but this was already close to closing time. \u00a0Since most people probably like to sit and linger longer for all the food to pass by..the turn around time for tables didn't seem fast because we were the 3rd to last seating for the night and only 2 tables left during dinner. \u00a0Anyways..make a reservation. However, this seems like a fun place if you were to eat solo..the bar area always looks festive as the kitchen is right there so it seems like there is always someone to chat with if you are feeling social.  The pricing is very decent minus the 4 glasses of wine from our bill..the food total came out to be about 70 for 2 persons and we ordered about 6 things off the carts/trays and 2 things off the \"commandables\" menu  I also found this recipe off Bon Appetit for the ribs...and I can't wait to try it at home.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bonappetit.com%2Frecipes%2F2012%2F09%2Fglazed-pork-ribs-with-shichimi-togarashi&amp;s=14188e546773f364b7fc88d11bcaea71465f7a9ad463ce074dc5a2e5d3c77607\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bonappetit.com/recipes/2\u2026</a>",

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions is a stupefyingly popular and trendy restaurant that falls short in the most important factor, TASTE.  Conceptually, this restaurant is near perfect-- a noisy-casual fine dining experience with an interchangeable wait staff bringing you high-end tapas style dishes directly to your table. \u00a0If you like what you see, you nod your head in agreement and they'll notch the order on your tableside menu. \u00a0Otherwise, they'll gleefully move on to the next guests to hawk their wares.  Adding to the allure, there are an additional twelve items not on the printed menu that are simply numbered 1-12 corresponding to the amount of dollars they cost. \u00a0You never know what mysterious dish may come around the corner so anticipation after each dish is quite tantalizing. \u00a0Brilliant.  Now here's the problem. \u00a0The food. \u00a0Each person's experience may vary depending on what they order, however, I've never experienced so many lows and mediocre misses from over a dozen items I've tried at such a highly touted restaurant. \u00a0I'm not sure if this was an off-night, but the food tasted like they were all prepared by culinary students without any quality control or executive oversight for someone to tell them the food sucks.  Let's start with the cast iron half dozen quail eggs. \u00a0A great dish conceptually \u00a0--execution-wise-- overcooked, rubbery, and flavorless. \u00a0Lamb pierogi was greasy, thick, pasty, and again flavorless. \u00a0Tuna poke(?) \u00a0Bland, unexciting, and \"meh\". \u00a0They even managed to screw up oysters with its overpowering mountain of sesame seeds and sour-kraut. \u00a0The food ranged from \"fine\" to \"okay\" to just plain \"bad\".  The night started off with great excitement, but hope was ultimately dashed after several rounds of underseasoned, overbalanced, and extraordinary uninspired dishes.   That said, State Bird Provisions is still a great concept and a freight-train in this city that's going to be hard to stop. \u00a0Service is top notch, casual, friendly, and quite frankly, eating here is fun. \u00a0However, I hope this restaurant doesn't fall under a level of complacency due to its tremendous early-on success and glowing reviews. \u00a0For me, there are too many options in this city where you can get plenty of better food without the wait, but hey, maybe you'll have better luck than me. \u00a0That is part of the allure after all.",

Both innovative and packed flavors.   Service was spot on and really helpful, especially for us first timers.   I'd recommend coming here at least once to try!

    "review_text": "We headed over to San Francisco after Las Vegas and State Bird Provision (@statebirdsf) is probably on top of my to-eat list. I plan my trip (aka restaurant research / reservation) probable over 2 months in advance and I still haven't been able to snatch a reservation. Good thing is they set aside a good portion of seats for walk ins.   They open at 5:30pm and we decided to head there at least half an hour early to line up (so unlike me who hate waiting in line for anything usually). It just happened that we were staying closer than we expected and arrives an hour early but there was already a huge line up... yes, we did line up for more than an hour. Good thing was, we were seated right away (no more waiting) since some people in front of us was there to get a table later that night. . Being voted as the Best New Restaurant of 2013, I had my eyes on this place for a while and was beyond excited to try. Love the \"dim sum\" concept where they bring out their daily specials of small plates on carts and trays with the price right next to it, then mark it on your \"menu card\". Yup just like dim sum! Then there's larger plate on their regular menu/a-la-carte.  Smoked Duck ~ This was the most underwhelming dish of the night, definitely not a great start to the meal since I did have high expectation.  ~ It was perfectly good and definitely not bad, just nothing special.  Guinea Hen Dumpling w/ aromatic broth $3 ~ Confit guinea hen with preserved lemon and mushroom in a chicken broth.  ~ The ravioli made in house was thin and stuffed to the brim but the star is the broth here, so intense and delicious.  Smoked Trout Mousse w/ Chips $9 ~ Love it with the potato chips instead of the usual tortilla chips for this and love the mushiness of the trout and the creamy avocado together.  Duck Liver Mousse w/ Almond Biscuit $6 ~ Though the concept was good but failed to deliver.  ~ The almond biscuit was kind of like madeleines, a buttery sponge cakes but thought it doesn't really go well with the mousse.  ~Too sweet and soft?! Maybe add a savory element to it or maybe a scone instead?  Albacore Tartare \"constructable\" $12 (half order) ~ Love the crispy nori chips instead of the usual chips or toasts and the fish was only slightly marinated which was perfect since it was so amazingly fresh.  Garlic Bread w/ Burrata $8 ~ The bread was twisted and rolled like a cinnamon bun and deep fried until golden brown which resulted in a crispy exterior and stretchy doughy fluffy interior, ~ With the stretchy creamy burrata cheese was a match made in heaven then topped with madras curry spices, peppercorns and fennel seeds made it even more perfect.  CA State Bird with Provisions $9 (half order) ~ This is their signature dish which is a must try according to very review I have read. ~ It was delicious although I still prefer fried chicken over this fried quail, I find that it doesn't have enough meet in contrast to the crunchy shell. .  Pork Belly Plum Salad ~ This was probably my fave dish of the night, the pork belly being braised before lightly battered and fried was super delicious.  ~ It was actually not fatty at all and the refreshing plum and bits of jalpenos complimented the crispy pork belly very well.  Bacon-curry w/ Crispy beef sweetbreads &amp; pickled squash $16 ~ This was way too salty.  Pickled local anchovy tomato toast $3 ~ This somehow came last but we were glad it did, love the crunchy sesame toast with the the anchovy and we infidelity didn't want to share this one.  \"World Peace\" Peanut Muscovado Milk $2 ~ This is another of their signature dish that's been feature in Bon Appetite Magazine and it tasted like a super fancy delicious peanut butter milk.  ~ They boiled unsalted peanuts in whole milk with vanilla bean and pour over dark roasted muscovado syrup.  ~ Love the light yet intense peanut taste with a mild vanilla backdrop. Delicious!!!  Asian Pear granita, Coconut, Tapioca, Persimmon $8 ~ We were rather full and still wanted to try their dessert so we choose the lightest one.  ~ This was light and refreshing, a perfect palette cleanser at the end of the meal.  Verdict: ~ Although there was hit and misses, we both fully enjoy our meal here (minus the wait) ~ Love the amazing attentive friendly service. ~ Love the dim sum concept so I can actually see the dish before deciding if I want it (def need something like that in Toronto)",

    "review_text": "My foodie in crime who loves to try amazing food suggested we come here. We don't like to settle for ordinary food that satisfies you easily when we are together. Heads up is that you should make a reservation of 2 months in advance if you want to secure a table.  Customer service: We came as walk ins and the hostess, Oozy (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was the sweetest with her great smile and personality. She tried her best into accommodating us with a reservation of 9:45 if there was a cancelation. We waited for 3-4 hours in hopes to get a table. And I guess luck was on our side because we were seated and from there we began our exploration of amazing flavors.   Atmosphere: The atmosphere was very nice, although it was very detail and decorated, it gave you a sense of at home dinning. With the bright open kitchen to the slightly dimmer and very easy going dinning tables. It's very cute because it's served in a \"dimsum\" style where they come around in a cart of tray and introducing these new food to you. And we just wanted to try everything. We just kept saying yes to everything that came our way.  Braised Pork: The braised pork was amazing. I thought they used parmesan to season it however only to be surprised that there was no cheese. The pork belly itself was braised in a way where the fat has wrapped around the pork forming this cheesy seasoning on top.  Salmon tartare with cucumber and crunchy quinoa: The salmon tartar with cucumber and quinowa was amazing. It was a heavenly match where the salmon was soft and it melts in your mouth while the quinowa was crunchy and gave you a sense of explosion. To top it was the fresh cucumber that made the whole sensation come with a light freshness.  Black forest black sesame ice cream sandwich: It was a perfect match for each other. The sesame sandwich base has a sesame taste that isn't overpowering your tastebuds while being a bit salted. It was a perfect match with the ice cream because the ice cream's sweetness balanced out the saltiness of the sesame sandwich so you can't taste it.  Roasted bone marrow with chanterelles &amp; pink peppercorn: For myself I wasn't exactly impressed with this dish because I think it's just not really my flavor, however my friend loved it. The dish was really well made though, the bone marrow came out perfectly fine and the texture was amazing because it just melts right when it gets into you mouth.   Dungeness crab with kimchi and tofu skin: This was a dish that I personally loved. It was recommended by one of the nice servers. I personally love the mix because the tofu skin and crab meat was soft along with a crunchy bit of kimchi and it's creamy spice sauce.  Sourdough, Sauerkraut, Pecorino &amp; Ricotta Pancakes: We think it was okay, it was definitely good but maybe a little heavy on the cheese taste. It felt a bit like I was eating a mozzarella cheese ball but it was fried to be a good crunch.  Quil Egg: This was good, but not my cup of egg. Maybe it was the mushroom in it that overpowered it a little. It had a slight herbal taste to it also.   Smoked trout, potato porridge, poached egg, nori: This was delicious.  CA State Bird With Provisions:  Hamachi-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker:  Raw Oysters with Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut &amp; Sesame:  We literally gained an extra 50 pounds last night and waking up still full. We will definitely come back with reservation next time in hopes to try what we haven't yet.",

    "review_text": "State Bird = hipster american dim sum. In short, that's how I describe it because they come by your table with small dishes and you pick the ones you want. Each item is priced differently, and you don't get people shouting and pushing you to get things. Instead, you get a friendly explanation of the dish and how much it is. Every time you take one, the server marks the area on your card for the item and so they can tally up the total cost. There are also a bunch of potentially larger dishes you can order separately.   We got quite a few dishes but I only remember a few, in order from my favorite to least: Duck Liver Mousse - Never been a huge fan of liver, but this was delicious, especially spread on the tiny almond biscuit. We ran out of biscuits and our server noticed and brought us out more. Guinea Hen Dumpling - pretty delicious but note it's just one large dumpling in soup Kimchee with Dungeness crab - much tastier than I expected!  Ca state bird - equivalent of really good fried chicken to me Oysters - you get 3, they weren't bad Steak Tartare - kind of tasty, but it's hard to tell when you get such a TINY piece. Yeah, we probably could have ordered more than 1 to try... but it didn't make me clamor for more Sourdough ricotta pancake - i liked this but the pancake was bite sized so it became forgettable. Pork Belly - was just ok.  For dessert, we got the peanut milk shots, chiffon cake, and the eggnog ice cream sandwich. The peanut milk shots were my favorite. The chiffon cake didn't stand out to me, and the eggnog ice cream sandwich was good, until you got to the center which was kind of sour/tart to me... it kind of ruined the whole thing.  Apparently you have to make reservations way in advance - I was lucky in that my friend had a free spot and I joined at the last minute. I really don't think I'd have liked it if I'd waited months, but it was a fun experience for having zero expectations. I'd probably come back if someone else really wanted to, but it's a one-and-done place for me.",

Chances of walking in is slim, unless you want to stand in line for an hour before they open, or you walk-in right before they close...but after multiple attempts, I finally got to dine here! We were literally the last ones seated at 10:50pm on a Friday night. But it was well worth it!  I'm Chinese, so I'm very acquainted with the whole dimsum idea. But having it done in a new American way is just that much cooler! Everyone is very nice and is very patient in explaining every dish to us. Everything had a very fresh and interesting (in a good way) taste to it, with a mix of flavors, but never felt too heavy. Prices were very reasonable as well.   Some of my favorites:  -guanciale chawanmushi -duck liver mousse -garlic bread with burrata -smoked trout avocado 'chip &amp; dip\" -fried quail -ice cream sandwiches!  But honestly, everything tasted amazing. If only reservations were easier to make, I would come back everyday!",

    "review_text": "One of the best total meals I've had in awhile - from the food, the flavors, the format to the service, setting and just overall impact...wow. They definitely deserve the line of people fighting to get in. I had so much fun!  They have a small menu of set items that you can order from that aren't passed around the room - a pancake section, some 'mains' including their state bird dish, and a dessert section. The rest of the menu is carried around the room on trays or wheeled through on carts for you to order just like at a Chinese dim sum restaurant. It's so much fun to watch what is coming up next - the element of surprise keeps you intrigued throughout the entire meal. There were so many diff items presented, and I love that they have stands showing the price for each dish too ranging from $2 to $9/dish. \u00a0I somehow managed to say no to 4 or 5 dishes even though I wanted to try it all. The pricing is totally reasonable as well! I expected the bill to be so much higher. \u00a0Tried a lot for under $60/person all-inclusive incl wine.  I won't go into too much detail since there are too many to describe, but from their set menu:  Everything pancake with smoked sturgeon and horseradish - the sturgeon was so fresh and delicious. The pancake was a bit big, so we couldn't finish it. Good fresh dish though. I saw the other 2 pancake dishes circulate the room. The first one that is vegetarian is composed of maybe 5 or 6 mini pancakes. The bacon pancake dish had 3 medium-sized pancakes (my neighbor said they were great). Then the sturgeon one had one large pancake. For dessert, the plum jam ice cream sandwich was so good. Bright tart jam, macaron-like sandwich portion, and an 'ice cream' filling with nuts and chocolate drizzled on top. 4 pieces to an order. So good.  'dim sum' dishes:  Best ones were the guinea hen dumpling (broth tasted like pho), shrimp/nori/avocado, fry bread with burrata, boudin noir  The kimchi pork belly, oyster, &amp; steak tartare were just ok, so fell into the shadow of the other dishes. Didn't get a chance to try the mashers, tuna w/quinoa.  Get there by 5:15p if possible and join the line if you don't have a reservation. They will separate out the reservations and seat them and then file everyone else in right away. The place fits about 60 diners, and I think at least 20 of us walk-ins were seated right away.   Make sure your entire party is there. The poor girl waiting before us had to leave the line because her dining partner hadn't shown up yet. They couldn't reserve seats for them either.",

A thick puffy rolled dough underneath the typical creamy cheese. Our favorite of the night. It came by towards the end of the meal and though we were stuffed, we were so tempted to get another. - Liver mousse with mini corn muffins (not the technical description, but what I got out of it): mousse was light and airy and corn items slightly sweet. - Mussels and scallops: mixed on the spot in a tomato base placed on top of guacamole and tall tortilla chips. Scallops were so soft and fresh I adored them. I'm not into mussels, but these were missing that briny fishy sea taste - Eggplant hazelnut zucchini: thinly sliced green vegetable loosely spiraled and put on top a eggplant pur\u00e9e. Hazelnut bits made the dish - Clams and tofu in a kim chee broth: cute oval cast iron/hot pot looking bowl housing these items. Again fresh seafood and the broth didn't overwhelm it. - Ribs: fall off bone HUGE and great flavors - Wine: by class sparkling followed by a red I asked the waitress to serve were both great.  Midlights:  - Fried green tomato: not bad at all but compared to the other items that were outstanding, via grading it on a curve, this makes it in my midlight category. The cheese sauce it was placed on top of was great. - Pancake: we got the pork onion one which was bit thick and not packing enough flavor for me - Chocolate dessert: was a bit unappetizing on delivery being unevenly chunky and all brown  Lowlights - With no menu of the passed items, don't know what's coming, so it's hard to save room for what you might like best - Harder with 2: would be more fun with 4. Unless you're like me and just order everything I want even though there's just the hub and I--and he doesn't even eat a lot of things.

    "review_text": "My dad raves about this place. Is it worth the fanfare and absurd 2 hour plus wait outside? To a certain extent it is. I think the long wait may boost the entire experience and for some, over bake expectations. Go with a small group of hungry friends and you should have a good time.  The interior has this kind of hip whimsy that you'd be more likely to find in Oakland. You can see chefs running a kitchen in the front yet I think the real entertaining chaos is reserved for the back kitchen. The space dining area is only large enough to keep that exclusive feel.  Food service is a la dim sum style. Food runners will carry food trays to eat table for diners to either accept or decline. The diversity of food and wait time is on par of most dim sum spots. The excitement of the food runners and energy of the patrons gives State Bird a lively atmosphere.  The food is a little hard to explain. All I can really say is that it's contemporary-fun California cuisine. I imagine this is food that chefs would feed other chefs. The food is whimsical and fun. It may sound and look somewhat strange but it's all about the flavors and textures. You will definitely not see any of these dishes coming out of most restaurants. I felt like I was eating the first or second draft of a food dish, but it still was unique and tasty. ____  Is it novelty or is it genuinely delicious? It's both.",

My favorite dishes of the night:  1. Sourdough pancakes. Brush a little of the side salt on and munch on warm comfort.  2. Trout chip n dip. Love avocado to death and this was a great interpretation of a classic. Could eat this all game on Superbowl day! 3. Albacore tartare. Beautiful looking dish. Add a side of seaweed crisp and this is a phenomenal piece. Textures of chewy fish, creamy mousses, elegant flowers, and the crisp sesame seeds come together. 4. Lamb entree is stunning. Every piece is so unique from tasty lamb to the belly section, squid, sauce, bok choy, it's a fantastic dish. There are a handful of items from the dim sum cart and menu that are \"spicy.\" And the temperatures were all spot on. Not too much, just the right amount of kick. Nothing lacked any kind of mild or bland flavors except for the garlic bread with burrata and the duck liver mousse bilinis. I wasn't thrilled by either dish despite them both being apparently very popular. Again, emphasis on the bilinis...(the mousse was outstanding) maybe I ask for too much flavor if the bilinis were replaced with the pancake-type carbs on the menu. Perhaps. State Bird Provisions!

Some dishes weren't worth the hype (state bird), some were unexpectedly good. It was a fun experience on the whole.  We got: - Pork belly citrus salad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#Lk50QyHltLzR78I8JXYp3A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $12: I liked this dish, particularly the flavor of the pork belly and the brightness of the citrus contrast. My friends' main complaint was that it wasn't fatty enough though, however  - Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#DEhnwY5huY2cANZjshINTA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $6: This was unanimously liked by the entire group. The mousse was subtle yet flavorful, very smooth and light, and went very well with the almond biscuits. Highly recommend!  - Hog island oyster, spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#b3rvChptM3UdyXvUY4YTuQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $3: I didn't try this since I don't take oysters, but my friends who did did not have anything special to say about it  - Smoked trout parfait with uni slaw (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#eC_m7xiM_x112nO99xmyQQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $10: Not the most photogenic of dishes, and the taste of uni was not very evident. The smoked trout though, was delicious.  - Farro spezzato with black trumpets &amp; fontina (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#B2_snLLdeLryKNLM3lYhRA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $9: Very comforting dish with the earthy taste of the black trumpets.  - Red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum vinaigrette (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#30TQ0sVkEZ6pNSLgyGY5AA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $11: I'd had this the previous time and had to order it again. Definitely did not disappoint. Our group loved it and we were left craving more. Highly recommend!  - Dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg bottarga (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#94E_I7gaAh2jsO9-tYoL6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $26: This was unspectacular though decent. There wasn't enough crab in the dish.  - Snacking pork with apple mostarda (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#s2PIyAHlc4-De2htMkoB3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $8: Another enjoyable dish, particularly with the apple.  - Maitake &amp; duck fried rice a la plancha (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#W8zNaUtVl6gVtCWZHDYMHQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $14: Second time I'm trying this, and I liked this rendition better. I'd found this overly salty the previous time, but this time it was just right. It was a perfect size for sharing among 5 of us, and we all scraped up every last grain of rice. They were pretty generous with the duck too. Recommend!  - CA state bird with provisions (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#tEEGKkgP0IHjMxXlhZuV8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $18: Underwhelming, given this is their namesake. It tasted like any other fried chicken, though it did go well with the onions underneath. They were nice enough to create a portion for 5 people for us though (it usually comes in portions of 2 or 4).  - Garlic bread with burrata (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#kWq-O9hig_Dy98q8Xl-nzQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $8: I'd heard so much about this dish but it was, while yummy, wasn't spectacular. My friend commented that the burrata wasn't creamy enough.  - Cheesecake japonais, guava cream, kiwi, pomelo (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#CJfB6qA-CtIS4Cf71XOoPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $8: This was the least favorite dessert we had (out of 4). The cheesecake is light, japanese style, but not very flavorful, slightly dry. The guava cream was definitely a plus though.  - Szechuan pepper ice cream sandwich, chocolate beer coulis, cashews (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#sTx6cOFxY6cPw0ak0u6UQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $8: The ice cream didn't taste much like szechuan pepper, though the chocolate coulis was a nice touch. Enjoyable all the same though.  - Cocoa-nib huckleberry granita, yogurt coconut cream, blood orange (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=GdUy7d_ubbBtjaCcTDJ0Xw#l2e2bvLslO030Dqkz-zOEw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) $8: Another dish that was unanimously voted the best among the group. Loved the tang of the huckleberry and the coconut cream went with it perfectly.  Also tried the fantastic peanut milk, which is a must-try.  Overall it's definitely a restaurant that's worth a repeated visit. Also appreciate that they added a candle as a nice touch since it was my birthday. Total bill came up to $57 per pax (incl tip/tax",

    "review_text": "Heaps of praise have been poured on State Bird Provisions over the past year. It has already won Bon Apetit's 2012 Restaurant of the Year award and is now a contending finalist for a James Beard Award in the Best New Restaurant category. It is nearly impossible to walk in and expect someone to give up their reservation. In fact, due to the recent critical acclaim, it took me nearly a year to finally snag a coveted reservation, which only opens a month in advance (and fills up quickly). Expectations were definitely high.  What makes State Bird unique is their menu. In addition to a frequently changing menu, you order from a number of small plates to tide you over until the dim sum-style service carts come rolling by. This was where it got dangerous because everything looked better plated than described on a menu. Order everything? We pretty much did.   Here's a breakdown of the menu plates we tried:  Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancake - I couldn't get much of the sauerkraut, but the pecorino and ricotta were distinct. These were addicting and I could see why people order more after the first plate.  CA state bird with provisions - Fried chicken, but with a quail. It was good, but not amazing.   Glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi - The meat was very tender, but it was too salty to enjoy.  Buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato' - This was by far, the best savory dish of the night. The crab was so buttery and delicious. It was like a really magnificent rendition of a crab porridge. Please sir, can I have some more?  Earl grey, almond &amp; cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich, riesling-poached winter fruits - This dessert was outstanding. It wasn't too sweet for a dessert and the presentation was beautiful.   And the plates from the cart:  Crispy pork belly with mint, jalapenos, and winter citrus - This was a great appetizer to start off dinner. I've had a lot of pork belly, but never with a combination of refreshing mint and citrus. Great contrast in texture with a splash of acidity.  Potato chips with beans, salsa, and avocado - It looked cool when the salsa was in the mason jar. It turned out to be really expensive chips and dip.  Raw oysters kohlrabi kraut - The worst plate of the night. The kraut completely overpowered the oysters, but the waiter gave us a free oyster for our party of 3.  Lobster croutons topped with lobster salsa - The croutons were genius. They had a satisfying crunch while drenched in lobster goodness.   Garlic bread with buratta - The bread had the texture of a churro. The buratta was good.  Rabbit with cannellini beans - Actually, this is tied for the worst plate of the night. The rabbit tasted exactly like cold grilled chicken. Really expensive chicken with hummus.  We washed it all down with the St. Stefanus, Belgian Blonde, which was an excellent beer to pair with our dinner. The service was great and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Most of the dishes were really hit or miss. There were a couple of really great dishes and a couple of awful ones. Overall, I wasn't wowed by the food. The concept is interesting, but if I have to wait this long to get a table, I better be impressed by most, if not, all the dishes.",

There is a line of hopeful patrons, waiting for the limited walk-in tables. \u00a0The cooks are ever busy. It is a gourmand's adventure, filled with savory dishes, wines, peanut milk and desserts to consume. The very bites you take expand your palate beyond belief. \u00a0Not as a lone person should you indulge in this. It is delicious.   I am still in awe of my two, yes two visits in one week to State Bird Provisions. The first was like a gift from God. I was just perusing the reservation web page late one night and realized they had tables available within an hour. My husband and I rushed down there and within 40 minutes were seated.   I'm sure everyone gets it by now that it is excellent food served dim sum style. But what really left an impression on me was the whole atmosphere of the place. Everyone that works there are really, really excited about their food just as much as I am to eat it. They are friendly, high energy people with such a positive vibe. \u00a0My husband and I couldn't help ourselves and ended up eating about 15 different dishes. Yes, 15 dishes and each one of them were excellent.   So then my friends wanted to go so we tried the wait in line approach. This worked out well also as we were early enough to be able to get a table right away. The wait until they opened was made easier by the staff bringing shots of drinking chocolate for everyone in line. I thought I would be more selective on dishes this time around, but failed miserably (ok, not so miserably). Between the three of us, we had about 17 dishes. Again, so delicious and creative.   I now understand and appreciate the hype. Not only do they make wonderful dishes, they make eating out enjoyable. I highly recommend bringing a few friends, but no more than 4 since you need a special reservation for 6-8. You will have a great time dining here. I sure did!",

I rounded up some friends and we had one of the best meals in recent memory. I liked the tapas style, although we felt the need to order quite a few different dishes off the regular menu. Instead of giving a blow by blow of each dish, I'll just say that the quality of each one was outstanding and the uniqueness of the dishes was often surprising. The downside to trying lots of experimental small dishes is that there are always going to be some you don't really like (and as a group we did tend to disagree from dish to dish) but at the end of the night, we all agreed it was one of the better dining experiences we have had in SF. And to top it off, it was relatively inexpensive given the quality of the food. Highly recommended!",

Yes it's delicious but I wouldn't make too much of an effort to get a reservation.   Anyways, the ambience. I love the ambience. It just yells out hipster and San Francisco. The waiters are hipsters but seriously know their food. Very in depth explanations of the dishes and they come to you like dim sum style which are supplements to the orders you make using the main menu. If you know how to eat dim sum then eating here would seem very familiar.   The taste of the food was great for the most part. There were some though that didn't carry too much weight with me. Kimchi dishes were too sour and the fried rice tasted like fried rice, just in a way smaller portion than what you would get at a Chinese restaraunt. But some other dishes were so unique and the taste was unique as well. I highly salute the chefs for coming up with such dishes. You won't be disappointed with most of the items there.   P.s. I got a major stomach ache after eating here but I think I figured out that I just can't eat duck which sucks. I love duck but I finally realized that I can no longer handle it in my stomach. Pity me. My stomach ache is in no part due to the place. I just can't handle duck :(",

It was also great for us that we didn't have a reservation, but because they save seats for walkins, we did wait outside in the line starting at 4:10 on a Saturday. Great way to get in here.  The reason, however, for my three star rating was because the host staff didn't even follow their own rules. We waited in line for 1.5 hours as a group of 4. The group in front of us was also a group of four and they got the last immediate seating (we would have to wait until 10:30!). The problem was that they were not a full party. Their third person hasn't shown up and they said he was right around corner. In the 15 min we remained coming up with a plan, he still had not shown up! So it was frustrating to force our entire group to wait in the line, yet have the group in front of us only partially wait, but get a seat against the restaurants own rules!

While the food rivals any fine dining in the city, the staff don't allow themselves to get caught in the pretentiousness that often accompanies high end dining. Each server was friendly and playful.

It was a decent restaurant, nothing was really bad, but nothing was that great. \u00a0I've eaten at all of the top restaurants, so I was sort of expecting that type of experience, but never got it. \u00a0Service was really excellent though.  The space itself is decorated in a spartan, almost amateur-decorated style. \u00a0The food was creative but too many flavors mixed together so that nothing stood out. \u00a0We probably had 1/3 of the menu and 2/3 of the off-menu dim sum style dishes. \u00a0We had about 1/2 the desserts. \u00a0The chili-chocolate ice cream sandwiches were a disappointment as you could barely taste any spice, but good if you didn't know they were supposed to have chili.  Nothing stood out. \u00a0Honestly, if I hadn't been told about the accolades, I would have considered it a very average experience. \u00a0  It's nice that the dishes are very small and meant to be shared so you can have a lot of things. \u00a0That of course makes for a more labor intensive environment, and that of course requires more $$$. \u00a0We ended up spending about $85 per person with tax and tip, no alcohol. \u00a0I didn't think it was overpriced given the make up of every dish, so I added a star or I would have given it 3 stars. \u00a0  If you bring someone, don't tell them in advance that this is the *it* restaurant right now. \u00a0They'll have the same opinion I did: meh decor, meh food, obviously a lot of labor that went into the food, creative ingredient list, results were nothing special.",

On a Friday afternoon, I stood in line starting at 4:40 p.m. and was about 25th in line (the restaurant opens at 5:30 p.m.). When I got to the front, we were lucky to get a spot at the chef's table at 7:30 - the people in front and behind us were only able to get tables at 9:30.   I love small plates and sharing - great to have lots of different tastes and flavors. And these plates are small enough so that you can try a bunch of different things. We got the pork belly, head cheese, beets and trout, garlic bread with burrata, dumpling with broth, trout roe with potato chip, state bird (with provisions), rabbit curry roti, dungeness crab with kimchi yuba, pork riblets, coffee ice cream sandwich and the granita. My favorites were the trout roe, garlic bread with burrata, rabbit curry roti and state bird - the rabbit curry roti in particular. So tasty!  The plates are pretty reasonably priced so, as my friend said, you can eat your face off!  All of the waitstaff were incredibly nice and helpful and provided great recommendations. We couldn't decide on dessert, so we had a half order of each. We didn't know that half orders were available but when we asked the waiter for a recommendation, he let us know that we could get a little of both!

I went with my husband, foodie friend, and my 5 year old son. He came away full and happy. He knows good food. My favorite was the duck liver pate w/ almond cakes. First off, the cakes were more like little bites of honey cornbread. The pate I literally, scooped onto my spoon and licked it off. No need to put the pate on the almond cakes at all. We had 3 orders. My son kept stealing the almond cakes off our plates. The hamachi on nori was beautifully presented. The nori was thicker than normal sushi nori but it was crispy and full of umami. The hamachi was tender and fatty and the light drizzle of sauce on top was perfect. There's nothing wrong at all with this dish. We had 3 orders of this. The ribs on the menu was surprisingly delicious and out-of-the-box. I thought they would likely be BBQ but I was wrong. They came on top of some greens that were drenched in oil. Too much oil on those greens. The ribs looked bland w/o the usually BBQ sauce drizzle and char. However, they were delicious. Not BBQ but braised likely. It was tender w/ the meat falling off the bones easily. I would have gotten another order had the greens not been so oily. The oysters were fresh but I did not like the overpowering mignotte on it. The lobster lentil salad was ok, not spectacular. The cerviche with potato chips was good. The fresh potato chips stood out more than the ceviche. The chocolate soda sounds really weird but I got it just to try. It is actually pretty good. It is good in a weird way. I don't remember what else we had. I was in a food coma and was blissfully happy. I didn't think it was that expensive. I think it is very reasonably priced for the quality of food. If the wait wasn't 2 months for a reservation, I would definitely go back more often. The service was wonderful and knowledgeable about what they were serving.",

I was totally wrong and I am soo sorry for thinking this.  Ok so I had no clue but everything is sort of served dim-sum style. Someone comes by and asks if you want a plate from their tray, and they mark off the amount on the card. Simple. \u00a0It ranges too. We had a vegetarian in the group and 3 other non vegs.  Favorite little dish was the nori with albacore on it. Totally awesome. Came with a bit of avocado and a garlic mayo combo (hip kids call it aioli I guess).  Honorable mention was definitely the pork belly plate but I mean it's pork belly, how do you mess that up.  There was a quinoa and corn starch that was great too.  People were talking about something like a garlic bread burata?, it was eh compared to other things on the menu. It was just garlic bread.  The duck liver confie was awesome too. I kept just dipping other dishes in it or spreading it along other items.  You can order from the menu as well, but among the 4 of us, we were all full off of taking 1 of each plate they had passed out throughout the night.   A special callout has to be made to the staff here. They are awesome. Super friendly, totally engaging and very attentive. They had no attitude about anything and they just provided an overall nice atmosphere and were actually excited.  When it came time for dessert we were stuck. We were at the standing counter all night which is right behind the place where they make the desserts. So we saw everything. But we thought we should ask. Everyone seemed to be ordering the ice cream sandwich dish, but no we were told by the server, we want the crunchy chocolate dessert. It sounded weird but it was delish. Just a bit nuty crunchy, chocolate not too sweet and man I was pleased. They even threw in a shot of the panicotta stuff after because they liked how we were up for anything.  Then the bill came and ... it was actually pretty reasonable. Every dish they had, split 4 ways, cost about 50 bucks WITH tip. Come on that is crazy awesome considering everything.  Pro tip, just suck it up and go for the standing table. (6month wait for regular table). It has the best view, so what if you have to stand, and you can get a seat day of.

I'll definitely be back to try more specials...   No fifth star for me quite yet because nothing really grabbed me... Although their home made fig and lime soda was pretty close",

This is a really fun, tasty restaurant experience with imaginative, beautifully presented small dishes and excellent service. The pork bellies, bone marrow and duck pate served on mini corn bread muffins were among our favorites, although everything we tried was very good. Try the sangria granita for a light dessert after you've over-eaten, which you very likely will. This is a bustling place and can get somewhat noisy.",

Everyone pretty much said \"Everything is awesome!\" Well, that doesn't help me \u00a0much since I can't get everyyyything. It was only going to be two stomachs ingesting this meal after all! Let me first say that I loved my meal here and would definitely come again.  I am in no way discouraging you from getting these dishes if you have a big penchant for a certain ingredient. If you're a huge bone marrow eater, then by all means, get it, it's still good. So since \"everything is awesome\" and I would like to help those who are like me...here are the dishes I tried that I felt were better to skip in favor of the better items:  Garlic Bread with Burrata - Yes, it's good but it really is just bread. I didn't taste much garlic and would skip this in favor of more interesting dishes (also, bread = carb = less stomach space for more food!!). Plus, it's $8 for essentially a piece of bread with cheese.   Bacon-curry w/ crispy beef sweetmeats - I didn't enjoy the strong flavors of this and felt like the items within it were so-so. There wasn't anything light to balance out the extremely strong flavors here. Perhaps, it's because it came last and we were stuffed already.   Bone marrow - Barely enough bone marrow for the bread. Most of it was the bone itself.  MUST get: Halibut Constructible, Ice cream sandwich, peanut milk shots (only if you really like peanuts)  Must know: Dim sum style. They have a basic list of items you can order with your waiter first. The rest will be served by people with trays or carts. You just need to pick out the items you want when they stop by your table.  The service was extremely friendly and our waitress was very attentive. She put our dessert on the house when they forgot our dessert order!",

Food-wise, some things were amazing, some things were simply good. \u00a0Strangely enough, the seasoning was completely inconsistent: The steak tartar had basically no salt in it, but the deep-fried eggplant was quite salty (and amazing!!).  The corn pancakes and quail were definitely on the amazing side, as well as the ice cream sandwich. \u00a0But the other things: Oysters, sea urchin pancakes, the ciccioli - definitely good, maybe not stellar.  Overall, I won't be coming back just because I prefer good service. \u00a0Like places that sit you on time (or truly apologize for not), deliver wine quickly when you have a dish infront of you (not 15 minutes), ask you if your dishes are OK and if you need anything, don't try to charge you for complimentary things at the end, and don't ask you if you want more food after you've ordered dessert. \u00a0The front operations were just such a circus... but for some, the food's probably worth the hassle.",

The wine list in my opinion could have had more depth in California wines, but we managed to find a couple of gems to compliment our food well. It lives up to the hype. On the negative side, the experience was wasted on the 11 &amp; 13 year olds we had with us, as they probably tried 25% of the dishes, as the other 75% were too \"Scary\"......not \"tween or kid friendly, so you'll need that babysitter or play date.

I normally don't mind waiting in line, but to find out that the people at the front of the line were not guaranteed a table, and also that their seating window was anywhere between 7pm-10:30pm, made me grateful I set my alarm for 3:58am lol.  Here's what we had:  Mushroom farro spezzato with whipped ricotta- Delish!! What a great start. Highly recommended.  Snap Peas with homemade sambal chili- I don't like snap peas, but M loves them. I liked the homemade sambal, but M didn't. At least I tried! If you are a fan of snap peas, you'll like this dish.   Salmon tartare with cucumber- I like cucumber but M does not, so I had it all to myself. He did, however, enjoy the crispy quinoa on top. It was too crispy for me. See a trend here? lol. I wouldn't order again.   Garlic Bread w/burata- Yum! I liked the saltiness of the bread. It wasn't as garlicky as I had hoped but it was still good. Loved the cheese. I'd get this again, but maybe later towards the end because it's very filling.  Fried Pork Belly- The first two pieces were great. Loved the sauce. The other two pieces we had were practically all fat. We couldn't finish it. Not sure if I'd get it again because I felt a little gross afterwards.   Stone-ground oat-crusted sweetbreads with favas &amp; ramps- My favorite of the night. The breading on the sweet breads was very crispy and I loved the vinaigrette that came with it. I didn't care much for the fava bean puree, so of course, M loved it. Haha  CA state bird with provisions- There isn't much meat on the state bird, but the meat I did get was good. I'm glad we only got half an order, because we were getting full by the time we got it.   Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - What a terrible way to end the meal. I really wanted to love this one, but we both agreed it was nothing special. The almond biscuit was very buttery, but that was it. It wasn't great. The mousse had a consistency like butter, but unsalted. It didn't add anything to the biscuit.   There was a long period of time between the first carts/trays of food and the second, so we decided to get the check. We had poor timing, because they brought out more food after we got our check. Perhaps this is done on purpose to get people out. Haha jk.  We'll be back to try other things like the bone marrow. I'm glad we ventured out to the city to try this place. Make reservations!",

Oh my, we definitely picked a lot of food!   However...there is one signature dish you must order on the separate menu: the State Bird with Provisions! This is a must have! It was my first time having quail and wow, I'm now a fan! You can either order a half or full order of quail, but since my date and I were munching away, we ordered the half order, and believe, it'll be enough! The breading was light, crispy, and *gasp* NOT OILY! The quail meat was very tender and the cheese and onions with it added a nice little kick to it.   I totally want to come back!

    "review_text": "SBP is like the hot guy whose photos you drool all over online, but when you finally land a date and meet up in person, you find out that he's a half foot shorter than you. Is he still hot? Certainly, but not everything you were hoping for. After all the struggle of obtaining a reservation, waiting for 2 months after the reservation was made, and hearing recommendations from several different people for this place, I was completely ready to fall head over heels in love. Did I discover the new love of my culinary life? Sadly no (Frances still holds my heart), but SBP is still a solid choice. I had several hits through the course of my meal here, but also experienced just as many misses.   Eating here gave me a good understanding of why tasting menus and prix fixe menus are set up the way they are. \u00a0The chef is certainly not shy about flavor. Unlike most upscale places with their complex but subtle flavors, the food here is rich and packs quite a flavorful punch. This was enjoyable for the first few dishes, but after several fat filled dishes in a row, it started to become a little too much. I now understand why many restaurants will offer a palate cleanser in between courses and opt for more subtle flavors. I'm sure everyone reading through these reviews has caught on to the dim sum format so I won't elaborate on that.   The price: The cart food is a little cheaper than the menu food. They range from $3-$10 each. Menu food runs $8-$20. The bill at the end for night for 2 people was $114.30 before tip and we got to sample 13 different dishes for that price. This is definitely on the more affordable side of Michelin dining. I wasn't blown away as I was hoping, but I'd be willing to give it another try in the future.   Hits for the night: Salmon Tartare, pork belly, hen dumpling in savory broth, duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, and the ice cream sandwich. \u00a0  Ok items: Hamachi on a nori chip, bone marrow (the bread was delicious though), peanut milk, oyster, state bird with provisions (tasted like a small fried chicken).  Misses: Garlic bread with burrata (I know yelpers loved this, but I just didn't get it. Tasted no garlic at all. Just tasted like black pepper flavored bread), egg with mushroom and bacon in a shot sized cup, rye crepes (a deconstructed crepe with a sauce that was just too sweet).",

State Bird Provisions has become a new favorite restaurant of mine and ranks up there with my favorite restaurants in SF. \u00a0The food is great, the atmosphere is lively, and chefs and staff are very friendly and enthusiastic. \u00a0And lucky me again, I've managed to score another RSVP for another 2 months! \u00a0Definitely looking forward to it!",

Nothing orgiastic, melting, burning and spinning, stunning your socks off - just healthy, nicely arranged, cute little dishes in a cute little restaurant staffed by young people with shaggy bangs and hipster clothes. The staff was friendly but again, while very competent the service was not particularly outstanding. Really great service is when the waitstaff just pour out knowledge about the food and wine; this staff is \"a little too cool for school\" without the drive and professionalism that really makes you feel taken care of. Before tip our tab was about $125 for two people which was surprisingly low given the huge number of dishes that we tried. I might go again sometime but it just wasn't enough of a blowout for me to become one of my all time favorites.",

It wasn't a big issue for us since we weren't super hungry at the time, but now that I reflect back I realize it was kind of a waste of time. Definitely get a reservation. If you do decide to wait, the line pretty much starts at or before 4:30pm.  The restaurant is American dim sum style so there is a menu that you can order off of and then they bring around trays and carts that have dishes that are not on the menu that you can order.   The food and flavors were innovative and fresh but nothing was extremely impressive. We tried 13 dishes and of those I'd recommend: - garlic bread with burrata - chanterelle toast - CA state bird provision (fried quail) - salmon belly with maple glaze - bacon chawanmushi (steamed egg) - asian pear granita with ginger tapioca &amp; blackberry; the granita is like a shaved ice texture which was tart and light - whatever ice cream sandwich they have when you go; for us it was the lemon cocoa nib with strawberries &amp; yogurt, sooo good and beautiful presentation  The other dishes, we thought were just okay or too salty or too oily. Sadly service wasn't the best for us; the girl who brought our drinks looked very unhappy, our waiter was a little difficult to flag down and we felt like we were waiting a while for certain dishes to come out. Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and it's definitely worth a try but maybe the bar was set too high because I wasn't blown away.",

    "review_text": "Some very memorable moments at State Bird Provisions. Pretty awesome.  A couple friends and I came to wait in line at 5:15pm on a Sunday, and we were just in the middle of the line. When the restaurant opened at 5:30pm, we just missed the cutoff for the walk-in tables. However, we were the first party to put our name down on the cancellation list, and headed over to Fat Angel for some drinks, just around the corner. A mere 30 minutes later, we got a call saying a party of 3 had cancelled/failed to show up, so we quickly got our check and hurried back to claim our table.  The waitstaff was very friendly and they patiently explained the whole \"American dim sum concept\" pretty clearly. Basically there were waiters who brought around trays of dishes which you could claim, and there was a supplemental menu that you could order from that would take a little longer to come out. We kinda went for broke and ordered a whole bunch of stuff, since we went through so much get a table, and we did not regret it.   We got the salmon tartare, smoked trout avocado dip, state bird (quail) with provisions, autumn vegetables, soup with dashi and puffed rice, fried garlic bread with burrata, duck ham, oysters, and the sweet corn pancakes, not to mention the apple g\u00e2teau and chocolate pudding for dessert. Yeah, we did go overboard, but no regrets at all. My favorite was the state bird with provisions, which had a very unique flavor. It was a bit on the small side for $18, but it was pretty unique, so I'll allow it. The fried garlic bread with burrata was really simple, but delicious and not too greasy. The desserts were both great, with the g\u00e2teau not being too tart and the chocolate pudding have a very good viscosity and texture, with sprinkled pumpkin seeds. The whole restaurant was just bustling with waiters bringing around dishes and everyone having a grand old time.  However, the most crazy part of the experience was near the end of the night, when a group of large Secret Service agents came into the restaurant. We were just about to finish our dessert, and as I peered over to see what was going on, and who else but Hillary Clinton comes in and sits down, just two tables down from our booth. Everyone in the restaurant is a bit too starstruck to say anything or even react, but there's quite a bit of loud murmuring going on in the restaurant. Man, I can only imagine being the waiter for that table. Hoo-wee.  Celebrity sightings aside, State Bird Provisions is well worth the wait, due to its well-executed concept and dishes. The prices overall are only okay, but you can sort of determine your own experience by ordering whatever small plates you want. If you can get a reservation ahead of time, I would highly recommend doing so. Overall, the experience and food is very unique, and I'll definitely be back.",

Sort of I can get my chicken feet from the cart, and order my chou mien from the menu.  Everything is fresh, quintessential of new California cuisine. Standout dishes are:  * Quinoa with small bits of red snapper and chrysanthemum: I couldn't say enough good things about this small creation, the favorite came out so unique and balance. My favorite.  * Cavatelli with dungeness crab &amp; tomalley butter: wow, please give me more! So light and fresh, the bread crumb added such interesting taste.  * 7 spice bread with ox tail, sun choke sauce, and lentil: who thought about this?  * Buckwheat bao (bun) with lemon cream: a piece of heavy that is only $5.  I like the layout of the restaurant, completely open kitchen in the front. Everyone is friendly, the chef was near the door when we left, and chatted with us a bit when I complimented him on the dishes (I rarely do). Such humble man!  Only complains are the place is noisy! It only died down after about 10:30pm. I could also see that if you are sitting in the back, you are in trouble! Cause all the deliciousness won't make it back to you. There is no good waiting area, but they actually can take your cell number and text you when your table is ready.   Service is friendly, you can tell each staff knows the dishes well.   Considering the quality of the food, this is a bargain place. We had a few drinks and about 10 dishes for two of us. $100 tips included.  And open till midnight, heck ya!

Onto food. \u00a0It's the same as before where you can order pancakes and some more substantial dishes off the menu, and there are around 10-12 dishes brought around dim sum style (prices listed), which you can add on. \u00a0We did pretty well for 5 girls!  - Smoke sturgeon pancake: a thicker pancake, lots of sturgeon (definitely smoky), like the beet accompaniment which added sweetness and a beautiful color - Uni pancake: a more traditional flat pancake topped with a generous amount of uni - Quail eggs: served sunny side up with cheese, topped with sun choke chips. \u00a0I'm a huge fan of runny yolks, which are hard to do when the eggs are so small, but they did a reasonable job - Salmon tartare: I liked the cucumber underneath, but it was a bit fishy for me - Lobster \"salsa\" salad: lots of chunks of fresh lobster! \u00a0But I could have done without the mayo. \u00a0Lobster was fresh, though - Crispy pork belly with grapes: one of the favorites of the night. It's exactly as it sounds - crisped pork belly, and the grapes soak up all the pork fat goodness and balance the heaviness - Hamachi on a nori cracker: fun to break up the large crisped nori, hamachi was fresh - Fried green tomatoes: I liked the shisitos and other peppers, slightly tart - Oysters: with a house togarashi on top, which I liked  - Charred baby octopus: good charred flavor, plump octopus, with a good bean and tomato base - Chanterelle, persimmon, quinoa tabouleh: The quinoa was crisp and added texture, but I would have preferred more chantarelles. \u00a0The pumpkin goat cheese was a nice touch. - State bird: fried quail, good flavor, slightly acidic sauce - Bone marrow: the mushrooms got pretty heavy thanks to the marrow, and it's on the larger side as far as bone marrow portions go... bread helps - Dumplings with maitake mushrooms and broth: the broth had a light lemongrass scent and was very fragrant, and the dumpling was pretty meaty considering it was just mushroom  Desserts:  - Apple granita with fennel and persimmon: parts of it were light, but it was a bit heavy on the fennel, and I'm not sure the persimmon matched it - Ice cream sandwich: good for sharing, just the right proportions of ice cream and cookie  Overall, it was a fun meal, and it's always great to be able to see/smell/hear about the dishes (and know the prices) as they come by before choosing them. \u00a0They have a wide variety to fit each person's preferences, so I definitely had my favorites (burrata, dumplings, sturgeon pancake, state bird). \u00a0  I'm glad they're finally back open and that I was able to snatch a reservation on the first day they opened the site back up (despite urban spoon crashing for over 45 minutes..).",

    "review_text": "After waiting three months to get a reservation for dinner on a Sunday night, I'm left puzzled about all the hype around this restaurant since I heard it was recognized as the Best New Restaurant in 2013 and has a Michelin star rating.  No, this is not a unique or new concept. Chinese people have been serving dim sum this way for decades. They serve food dim sum style with carts pushed to your tables or brought out on trays and you can also some items off their short menu. There are also plenty of tapas restaurants around too. It's definitely not your average dim sum/small plates but a fusion of different flavors.  The items we ordered were hit or miss. I was a bit underwhelmed with the selection.   We ordered the following: - Pork belly - Potato dumpling and duck tongue pastrami - Egg custard with mushroom and bacon - CA State Bird with Provisions (fried quails) - Lamb shank pierogi - Ham style duck breast - Young green peanut falafels - Fried garlic bread - Homemade ice cream sandwiches (melon ice cream, ginger coconut milk, Asian pear, and Shiso)  My favorites for the night were the lamb shank pierogi, green peanut falafel and the ice cream sandwhich. I hear the outside of the ice cream sandwiches were made with crushed macarons.   Even making reservations ahead of time, we weren't able to find a seating time until 8pm on a Sunday night. There were people who even came and dined alone since the wait time was more acceptable that way. The food itself was on the pricer side for such small portions. I think this may be a one time experience for me. I have so many places I still want to try still in SF.",

My top 5 favorites of the evening: - mushroom &amp; quinoa with toasted 'gomasio' - duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini - raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame - garlic bread with burrata  The mushroom &amp; quinoa and hamachi crostini dishes tied for my overall favorites. I, of course, overindulged and had a few other small plates and was pleasantly stuffed to the gills. \u00a0The ambiance was a bit loud, but I thoroughly enjoyed the lively atmosphere. \u00a0Upon leaving, the majority of the staff behind and in front of the counter made it a point to smile and thank me for coming in. \u00a0  Definitely going back soon!",

It was PERFECT -guinea dumpling ($3/pc so order a whole one to yourself) -Thai tea granita (it's like an ice cold refreshing tapioca mixed with shaved ice)  We ordered some other dishes, it was very \u00a0salty (maybe from the capers? Not sure...) we forgot out waiters name (thank god it was on the receipt, FORREST!!) we wanted to personally thank you again for letting us know not to overly order from the menu and let us check out the trays that were brought out and we loved your recommendation of the granita.

    "review_text": "Everything was delicious! The flavor pairings were all great and my 5-person group pretty much tried everything that wasn't solely a vegetable dish. (We weren't in a healthy mood.)   The unique dim-sum serving style made the eating process very leisurely, but if you come hungry you'll probably not appreciate it as much until you've gotten a few dishes in you. However, that said, use the time in between dishes to really savor the flavors and textures!   Savory must-try's:  - pickled wild mushrooms with root purees &amp; hazelnuts - anything with duck - 'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravy - bone marrow bread - the state bird provision (fried quail with lemon stewed onions)  Sweet must-try's:  - chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayon - milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jam, coffee cream (it was like a refined Krackle)  For all those tea drinkers out there: try the white chrysanthemum tea! It's really light and went well with everything.   The price of the dishes were a bit on the more expensive side, though, and after all was said and done, our bill came out to be about $170, including a pot of tea and 2 big bottles of beer, excluding tip. For the price each of us paid, I personally would have liked to walk away feeling very stuffed, rather than feeling contently filled, but that's just me wanting to feel like I got a great deal.   Last thing to mention is parking, which is hit-or-miss on the surrounding streets. I would recommend driving around the block once or twice just to see if you get lucky, otherwise you can always use the Fillmore parking lot which is just one block away. We paid $5 for 2 hours there, which isn't bad at all.",

    "review_text": "I've been here twice now. First time was before the renovations. It was a lot smaller, about half the amount of tables. We waited 45 min in line before it opened on a Friday night. They take reservations, however it fills up incredibly quick and you have to book it way in advance. If I remember correctly, it's 60 days in advance and it's updated at midnight. They reserve half their tables for walk-ins and the other half for reservations. From experience, it's easier to wait than to book a reservation if you don't mind waiting. The first time I went was for a girls night out, we each ordered a glass of wine and was seated by the bar. We were able to watch them make the food and was able to chat with the workers and cooks. Everything we had was delicious. The way the restaurant works is like dim sum. It's small plates and the workers come by with the small plates, describe it to you and if you like it they give you that dish. There's a price for each dish and they just tally it on your tab. At the end of the night, they add up the tallies and that's your bill.  The second time I came was to bring the bf out for a nice dinner. Especially since he hasn't tried this place. I walked in amazed at the renovations. It's very spacious now and can accommodate a lot more guests. We had their salmon tartare, delicious, and came with a giant shrimp cracker. Ahh childhood memories. I LOVED IT. We also had their crab louie salad. I would have passed, but the bf liked it. I ordered the liver mousse with the almond biscuits again. YUM, a classic and must try here! They also had a mushroom porridge dish that I really liked, I love porridge though, kinda biased. Their state bird provisions dish is a classic as well. If they have their dumplings in a chicken broth, YOU MUST GET IT. It was very flavorful and the broth was so rich. They also had oyster shooters that night, delish! Can't go wrong with oysters. Had to get wine with our dinner as well. They have a good wine selection.  Service is on par and I love that they describe to you each dish and they come around more than once if you regret getting something or missed any dishes.  Definitely coming back again. Maybe with more people that way I can try everything! Just a downside that reservations are so hard to snatch!",

We went in a group of 5 and tried most of everything that came by on the carts while only ordering a couple dishes off the menu.  Mostly the food was good. Only a couple of the dishes were crazy delicious. We went a year ago too and I remember a lot higher crazy delicious to good dishes ratio, but since the dishes change every night, I guess some nights are better than others. Some of the memorable dishes were:  - Oysters - pretty good! They came with I-don't-know-what on top of the oysters, but it tasted good!  - Mushrooms on bread - This was from the menu and it was delicious! Do not leave State Bird Provisions without trying this!  - Salmon with seeds on top - The combination sounded interesting and the dish looked really pretty, but this wasn't memorable taste-wise.  - Chips and trout/guac dip - This was delicious! The trout and guac mix went together surprisingly well.  Desserts were less exciting though, but maybe my nut allergy removed the best options. We tried an olive oil cake, but this tasted pretty bland. The peanut butter milk was good though!  I love the creative environment of SBP - tons of different types of food and surprisingly good combinations of ingredients. This is a must-try for anyone who lives in/near SF!",

    "review_text": "Whether or not you like State Bird Provisions comes down to one thing, and one thing only. \u00a0Do you like (or are you a), hipster?  The food is excellent. \u00a0It's a strange concept to only have half the menu on the printed menu, the rest is brought round on trolleys and you either have it if you like the look of it, of you don't if you don't (or if you're already full). \u00a0It's an interesting concept, that really doesn't work all that well, since you can't plan your dining experience. \u00a0We found ourselves not taking something we liked the look of out of concern that we might be too full for something that may come later. \u00a0Not knowing what might come later really impacts what you might eat. \u00a0While it's an interesting idea, and helps the restaurant stand out from the crowd, it really doesn't work.  What lets the place down is the decor and the servers. \u00a0Everything is all oh so cool, in the sense that the art on the walls is hung by copper wire instead of picture string, so as to make it look as if it has been hung using whatever they had lying around, because they are too cool to worry about going and getting the right stuff to hang pictures. \u00a0The problem is with trying so hard to look cool is it is so obvious you've done it. \u00a0I'm an electrical engineer and I don't have copper wire just lying around - clearly they went to buy it just to make themselves seem more spontaneous. \u00a0It's pathetic, and it pervades the place. \u00a0Another reviewer referred to it as feeling like you're eating in a schoolroom - my wife and I had exactly the same discussion while we were there.  Similarly, the waiters we all oh so cool. \u00a0The blood sausage they brought round hadn't been bought from a supplier, it was made by, \"one of their friends\". \u00a0The desperate efforts to seem like they are incredibly individual, when really they are just conforming to the culture they have decided to conform to really began to grate with me.  When all is said and done, the quality of the food papers over many of the cracks of the place, and that's good. \u00a0When you go for a meal, the food should be the primary concern, and they got that very right. \u00a0The deserts especially were fantastic (I'd put the rice pudding I had in the top 5 deserts I've ever eaten). \u00a0It's a little expensive ($140 for two people, and we had very little alcohol - 2 beers between us), but fair play to them, the line of people waiting to eat is testament to the fact the prices are OK.  The overriding question for me with most restaurants is, would I go back, and this place gets a resounding no. \u00a0If you're into doing everything you can to make it look like you're an individual, you'll probably love it. \u00a0If you don't, you'll enjoy the food, but find the place itself irritating.",

A tip for the spontaneous: don't underestimate the line. \u00a0We ambled over at 4:40pm on Saturday and ended up 24th or something with a 9:45pm seating time. \u00a0Ultimately, we got bumped up earlier, but just be prepared and/or flexible. \u00a0And, if you can help it, be a small party.  The attention to service felt almost curated...from the chocolate milk shots in line to the detailed intros of each laden tray to the whip-smart efficiency of the maitre d'. \u00a0And of course, it's a culinary paradigm shift: dim sum style transformed into a completely reinvented dining artifact: a modular, ever-changing menu, various seating arrangements, and an overall DIY-eclectic feel to the space all contributing to this culinary concept of self-made fun.  However, I'm afraid that in execution, the concept slips a bit. \u00a0 - All of the seafood dishes were hits: lobster salad, scallops and avocado quinoa, oysters, nori cracker with tombe tuna. \u00a0(I swear, that seafood cart is rolling straight to the foodie hall of fame.) - A couple more hits: state bird and peanut muscovado milk (I could pound shots of this all night long). - But several others were misses: guinea hen dumplings, spicy yuba noodles, ricotta dumpling, sweet corn and mt tam shortstack. (sounded good, but all the ingredients/flavors were muddled and dull.) - And a few others suffered from mis-pacing (inevitable in the dim sum format but regrettable all the same): garlic bread burrata, steak tartare with house made chips, and some crudo (and perhaps others?) that never made it by our table  So, 3 stars on the food (with drinks, it came out to $120 before tip), but the passionate service and flat-out fun experience tip it over to 4 stars. \u00a0I think even execution and distribution remain significant challenges (or lures for additional visits?) but how can you not fall for a place that believes so much in itself that they'll see your full tummy and raise you a half serving of the chocolate ice cream sandwich? \u00a0Self-made menu, thank you very much.",

    "review_text": "All in all, very pleased. \u00a0This place lived up to the hype. \u00a0Everything we had was good to excellent. \u00a0The concept of this restaurant is neat. \u00a0I like the idea of gourmet dishes coming out on carts for you salivate over. \u00a0When they bring them by, it is really hard to say no. \u00a0We were starving when we arrived, and within three minutes, before we knew it, we had six dishes on our table and were overwhelmed in foodiness. \u00a0This place serves about 2/3 of its menu via dim sum carts (think of these as your appetizers) and the rest is made to order (mains and desserts). \u00a0The best strategy is to bring a group of people and just try a bunch of stuff. \u00a0Slow it down after the first few, and then order some larger stuff. \u00a0Save room for dessert.  We ate the following:  - Saurekraut pancakes - i had never heard of such a thing and they were great. \u00a0Little silver dollar pancakes with tangy, crunchy sauerkraut in the middle. \u00a0delightful.  - scallion ginger pancakes with uni and soy lime glaze - amazing. \u00a0The uni was really fresh and added that nice briny creaminess that really worked with the flavors of the glaze and mixed nicely with the texture of the pancake  - green garlic burrata toast - what more can you say.....puffy green garlic toast with burrata smeared all over it. \u00a0delish.  - guinea hen dumpling - loved it. \u00a0the broth was incredible.  - state bird with provisions - breading on the quail is awesome and the bird is perfectly cooked. \u00a0the onions and parmesan are an unusual but delicious combo.  - peking duck - duck leg confit, with scallion crepes, some pickled type of mushroom and plum sauce - really, really tasty. \u00a0I loved this.  - steak tartar caesar salad - very good, but all you could really taste was the dressing. \u00a0That said, the dressing was really good.  - tuna crudo with chickpeas, capers - delicious. \u00a0had a nice cuminy flavor. \u00a0served with potato chips.  - quail eggs with sunchokes and ravigote - amazing. \u00a0tasted like breakfast in the most wonderful way. \u00a0the sunchoke chips were a nice crunchy texture.  - crab with mandarin gelee with avocado - this dish was good as long as you had every component of the dish in one bite. \u00a0if not, it tasted kind of bland and mushy.  - sweetbread, veal and pork meatball with fig - very good, but it did not blow my hair back.  - cheesecake souffle - excellent. \u00a0was light, tangy and creamy all at the same time.  - earl grey ice cream sandwiches - delicious. \u00a0the earl grey ice cream was amazing. \u00a0  the only downside was that the service was sometimes a little lacking. \u00a0by and large, servers were attentive, but there was a little lag in getting drinks sometimes. \u00a0The fast pace of the dim sum style was a little intense at times too. \u00a0You are bombarded with food as soon as you sit down. \u00a0Service is very quick and it is NOT meant for a romantic, quiet night out. \u00a0Its not bad, it is just different.  Great spot. \u00a0Nothing else like it. \u00a0WIll go back as soon as the buzz dies down a bit.",

It is a tough reservation to get, but one that I will make and clear my calendar for.",

You are greeted immediately by the kitchen and its staff, followed by a member of the incredibly friendly waitstaff, and then (if you are lucky), your well-appointed table. Everything at SBP feels intentional and refined without being stuffy or highbrow.  For $80 including tip, we enjoyed 6 dim-sum style plates offered by tray/cart (including heavenly Drakes Bay oysters), 1 item from the standing menu, and two desserts in addition to the two beers we ordered while waiting for our table (reservations highly recommended as we lucked out on getting our spot and this place's popularity is soaring for good reason).  All of the dishes tasted uniquely well-balanced--the menu here is an incredibly thoughtful fusion of local ingredients, distinct flavors and a wide variety of styles.  This is a great place to go with folks who share a sense of culinary adventure an an appreciation for quality ingredients and service.  Our new favorite restaurant!",

    "review_text": "Meh. More like 2.5 stars. Whimsical concept, liked the idea of dim sum for California food. We tried 5 of the \"floating\" plates. I found the dishes innovative but unfortunately the flavors were quite forgettable. The pork belly with kimchi for example - have you ever had kimchi with absolutely no heat? or any pickled flavor? or pork belly with no crisp whatsoever? It was cabbage with fatty pork. Oysters were blah. Burrata on garlic bread - which is a dish even I couldn't mess up - was a huge disappointment. Didn't have any salt (which it needs) or olive oil (which helps it), and the garlic bread had no garlic. The pancakes with Mt. Tam were wonderful - and tasted just like warm Mt. Tam cheese. On the plus side you can start eating as soon as you sit down which is wonderful if you're hungry. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.   Note for anyone considering this for a date spot: do you want to be interrupted every 2 minutes by someone carrying a tray of food describing the contents therein?",

I was trying to get reservations here (by refreshing their website over the past month), but nothing was available for the night that I was going to be in SF. Sooo...I decided to try the \"walk-in\" method on a Monday evening around 6:15 pm. I arrived, checked in with the hostess and she actually said that they will have an opening at 8:45 pm!  SCORE!!!  Instead of dining at House of Prime Rib that evening, my friend and I decided to wait for our reservation at 8:45 pm since it's so rare to be able to secure a spot at this restaurant! WHAT A GREAT DECISION WE MADE. :) We hung out in the neighborhood for 2.5 hours or so until our reservation time. Good thing there was lots to catch up on since I was visiting for the week. haha  When it was our time to check-in, we went to the restaurant and waited for about 15 more minutes as the folks (who were sitting at the bar where we were going to be seated) were wrapping up their meal and paying their bill. We finally got seated at the 2 bar seats to the very right of the restaurant and nearest the door (there were only 2 bar seats facing the restaurant windows). This location is great in our opinion because all the dim sum items get made right in front of you and you get first dibs on the dim sum cart! WOOT. :) It can get a bit loud since you're sitting near the door/people are coming in and out of the restaurant. All that aside though - our bar location was great. It was just 2 of us dining anyways.  Given that it was our first time there, we ordered items from the dim sum cart + items from the menu itself. Here's what we ate:  CA state bird with provisions - this is the must-get staple dish, since this item was pretty much named after the restaurant itself. everyone gets it; you can find it on the menu instead of the dim sum cart. it's quail! duck liver mousse - the little buns that come with are so dainty and delicious wild salmon tartare wild mushroom farrow - flavorful; i should have gotten one just for myself haha oyster w/ sesame - fresh! hamachi crunch - the crunch makes it divine! red trout black sesame ice cream (dessert) - SO GOOD tres leches (dessert) with rhubarb jam - SO GOOD  In all, we spent only $90 (this includes tip too) for 2 people and felt fulfilled. It was such a great meal - just enough quantity and quality! \u00a0THANKFUL that we were able to do walk-in on a busy night and eat to our tummies delight!",

This is definitely my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.  Where do I start? The food is amazing and unique. Every time we go there are always new dishes on the menu so you really won't ever get sick of this place. The food is tapa style which is great for me since I do not eat much but love trying out different dishes. Price is extremely reasonable for such exceptional food. I won't go into details about each dish because there are too many to name but our favorites include: the staple state bird of course (fried quail) , pork belly, lobster risotto, hamachi on fried nori, trout, steak tartare and the to die for ice cream sandwiches.   The service is beyond excellent. We all know how popular this place is and how hard it is to reserve a table here. Even with their immense popularity they are not snobby or rude as one might except. They are extremely accommodating and willing to make sure everything will work out if you need to change your reservation. Katherine is exceptionally helpful and accommodating. If it was easier to make reservations I would be eating here at least once a week. \u00a0  San Francisco is known for superb food and culinary excellence but state bird definitely is well deserving of its new One Michelin star and popularity.",

    "review_text": "I don't know whether State Bird Provisions (SBP) is the best new restaurant in America, as the James Beard award declares, but SBP is definitely the most exciting restaurant I've been to in the past year. Much has been written about the core concept being inspired from Dim Sum, but frankly, it is the execution, energy, and personality that set the restaurant apart from any reference point. The servers, and one of the owners (Stuart) who I didn't recognize then, are passionate about what they do, and you can see that in the glint in their eyes - as they also size you up on what would appeal to you!  The modular, changing menu is divided into four distinct sections: Pancakes, Commandables, Desserts, and Provisions. You could order plates from the first three sections, and/or you could wait for the staff to bring in front of you a tray featuring a \"Provision\", and select it if you like what you see. The best strategy would be to pick a popular dish or two between the Commandables &amp; Pancakes, and choose well amongst the Provisions brought forth at regular intervals. You could select 3 to 4 Provisions (small-ish), while leaving room for dessert... I totally got carried away and didn't pace myself well.   Despite reading prior yelp reviews carefully I immediately pointed towards the almond biscuit and duck liver mousse, and the steak tartare with chips and jimmy nardello ranch. I didn't think much of the former (either the biscuit or the duck liver mousse), or the latter, other than being amused by the construction. These two misses were followed by the guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth. Though, the dumpling was little more than a bite, I liked the dish. Next, I nodded at the charred octopus with chickpeas and tomato salsa. Charred octopus is currently featuring prominently across cuisines and cities in America as a popular appetizer, and though I didn't think much of the octopus' texture (compared to superior versions in Greek restaurants of NYC), the tomato salsa played off really well with the chickpeas. Mindful of limited stomach capacity I skipped the garlic bread with burrata, and instead chose the smoked trout with potato porridge, poached egg, and Nori. This was the first of my five star experiences in the restaurant with the senses being given a thorough workout by the smokiness, textures, and flavors. \u00a0  Trying to balance my indiscipline with some greens, I next ordered the SBP Thali salad from the Commandables. This dish features greens the restaurant grows such as shishito peppers, in addition to yogurt, curried cauliflower and pappadum. Typical of the fusion across cuisines successfully pulled off by SBP, I marveled at how well executed the pappadum was and how refreshing the dish was (5 stars). By this time, I had no discernible appetite remaining, and so I can't commend the next provision enough: albacore tuna, avocado on a plate of sea weed cracker - again a m\u00e9lange of colors, textures and flavors, and not to be missed out is the perfection of the crunchy, seaweed cracker (5 stars!). Going with my fervent belief that desserts are processed by another stomach with separate capacity, I went with the mint ice cream sandwich accompanied by chocolate plum coulis, and pistachio. Personally, I thought the macaron sandwich did nothing to enhance the experience (other than being friendly to those who like gluten free), but the rest of the ingredients paired off well together (another 5 stars).  With a glass of Rose (2012 Abbaye Saint Hilaire Coteaux Varois en Provence), and including taxes and tip my bill turned out to be $ 90 - which was much higher than expected for I clearly ate 2-3 dishes more than I should have. But then: what's a vacation if you're not splurging on yourself?  Standing in line outside the restaurant (I was 35th despite getting in at 4:45 pm, well before the restaurant opens at 5:30 pm), in my 8th year I realized just how useful yelp is. I had checked in to the hotel at 4:15 pm, taken a bus straight to the restaurant, and was able to dine at one of America's premier restaurants, while a multitude of bemused locals and tourists passing by had no clue as to why the restaurant was so popular. Now, not only did I know where and why - but I also knew when to get in line, what to order and how much should I expect to pay. That's truly priceless!  SBP is one of those rare cases where the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts. So, yes, do get in that line before they take a summer break...",

    "review_text": "It was the most over-hyped restaurant of all time.   I walked in at 845pm on a wed night and was immediately seated \u00a0with no reservation. Shortly after, a massive line formed so I guess I was really lucky.  We ordered the sour dough pancakes and state bird off of the menu and got the rest of the dishes from the carts.  The first thing we ate was the dumplings which were not much better than a pot sticker. Not impressed.  Our statebird came and was a great dish. Probably the best quail I have and will ever eat but it begged the question why you would even want to eat quail in the first place. It was rough on the outside but juicy on the inside. Pretty good but felt like i was eating a fancy chicken wing.  Next, the seafood cart came and I ordered three items, a lobster and honeydew dish, a scallop dish and some stopped oysters. The oysters were actually really great. I cannot remember what the topping was but it was a nice addition to a strait oyster on the half shell. The scallop and lobster dishes were good and creative but just did not blow me away with taste.  lastly, the pancakes came and were pretty tasty and interesting. Sort of a new take on a latke. Again, a creative and tasty dish but nothing that I would crave.  And that was it. I walked out of there wondering what all the fuss was about. With not hype this place would have probably gotten a 4/5 from me. The food is well prepared and there are some creative dishes for sure. However, due to the hype I am going to give it a 3/5 as it set my expectations too high. I also really liked the dim sum theme. However, at the end of the day, the taste of the food is the most important part of the meal and I have tasted better food elsewhere.",

    "review_text": "Excellent Service! Excellent Food! Excellent D\u00e9cor!  It is difficult to get a reservation here at State Bird Provisions. HINT: trick is to get here early before they open at 5:30PM and get on their walk-in list. I've seen folk line up as early as 4:30PM! My recommendation would be getting here around 5PM. If you're lucky, you can get a table when they open. If not, most likely you would get a table for 2 at 7PM or later at 9PM. This restaurant is not meant for large party; best to have a party of four max.  Emily, our hostess, was a warm and welcoming face for Provision and 'seated' us by 7pm by the standing table (door area), Even though I was at the standing table , I thought it was one of the best 'seats' in the house. We got to interact with various sous chefs and was usually offered first in everything that was coming out of the kitchen.   At Provision, they bring out a platter of the same dish (similar to the idea of dim sum) for you to take or not to take. If you do decide to take a dish, they will mark your menu and keep track of your orders. There are also dishes you can order off the menu, but the best ones are the fresh ones coming out of the kitchen for you to nab.   I've literally almost tried everything that was coming out of the kitchen. What stood out for me even after a month were \u00a0the Hamachi Nori Cracker and the Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich. Everyone should have their own Cracker and Ice Cream for sure! It's so good that you won't want to share!  Tip:  - free dessert shot if 'seated' by the standing table' (by front door) -kill some time with Happy Hour close by on weekdays -wear comfortable shoes   Overall, Provision was so good that I wanted to grab another meal before I left the Bay area. Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays. Provision would you please send me some yummy Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches? A girl can dream, right? Keep up the good work; \u00a0your dishes are tasty and creative, till my next visit!",

Not a quiet place, no real dressiness required, but still somewhere you'd wear casual white-collar work clothes to.  Food is served dim-sum style, with workers carrying trays and pushing carts of dishes that they bring to every patron and explain. You can then pick your plate and they mark it down on a menu/list that keeps a running total of the dishes/prices you select.   If you enjoy tapas/dim sum esque variety in your dinner then this place is an absolute gem. We literally are until we were stuffed and there were still a good 4-6 dishes we wish we had room for.  Bone marrow with thick toast and bruschetta, buttered toasted baguette with chanterelles, fried quail with cheese (the state bird - with provisions,) curried thick-cut bacon, shallot-garlic corn potato mini-pancakes with fresh aioli, and heirloom tomatoes in chili aioli with toasted sesame and quinoa were just a few of the dishes that we tried, and were absolutely satisfied with.  The quality, diversity, and creativity of the dishes were all top-notch, and this fact coupled with a rotating menu will guarantee our return: 6-hour wait be damned.

    "review_text": "I was only in SF for a day, and my culinary mission focused mainly on scoring a seat at State Bird on a Saturday night (ambitious, I know). I walked in at 7PM, and they told me that there would be a seat ready for me at 10:30PM -- for which I was totally willing to wait, and I got a call at around 10:15PM telling me that a spot was opening up. I hustled on over, and they seated me at the counter by the chefs. The experience was worth the wait, and the $63 bill (no drinks).  When dining solo, it's hard for waitstaff to gauge whether they need to give you space or constant attention, and the friendly people of State Bird managed to strike a good balance. They give you a menu with the \"permanent\" items, and, as mentioned, everything else comes by dim-sum style on carts and trays for you to ogle.  I started off with the State Bird with Provisions ($9 for half portion), because, duh. This crispy little quail died for a good cause -- the batter was terrific and aromatic, and the provisions of onions in broth with cheese shavings were a nice accompaniment, though perhaps a little soupy for the crispy fowl.   The Corned Beef Tongue ($6) came by and I couldn't pass it up. Served alongside tiny potato dumplings and a green garlic emulsion sauce, this dish had great chew and savory flavor. The tongue was tender, and not rubbery, and was fairly generously portioned - good for sharing. I liked the sauce, though I wish it had been a tad more spicy.  I picked the Pork Belly with Blood Orange Salad and Jalapenos ($10) off a tray, and this was definitely one of my favorite dishes of the evening. The pork belly was cut into a few large cubes, adorned with a tangy, citrusy dressing, and sprinkled with lots of herbs and slivers of blood orange. I love fatty flavors, and I enjoyed the tender and crispy parts of the pork belly, complemented well by the sour dressing and spicy peppers.   A cart came to me, laden with lots of savory options, and I opted for an Oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame/chili oil ($3). Normally, I'm a big fan of the unadorned bivalve, but these looked really delicious, and the crunch of the kraut played well with the fresh, briny oyster. A solid pick, and obviously not shareable.  The thing I'd been hunting for came my way - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Financiers ($6) - and I snapped up that little dish immediately. I'm a big foie gras fan, and while their rendition of the liver wasn't the best I've ever had, it was certainly served in a novel way with the sweet, spongy little almond biscuits. This seems like an ideal dish to share, since you do get a good number of biscuits and not everyone can put back that much rich liver.  Just when I thought I couldn't take it anymore, a tray showed up bearing tiny cups of Chawanmushi topped with guanciale ($5) - this was described to me as Japanese egg custard. I liked this ok, but it's not normally a dish I'd order; it just looked so cute and I was at my fullness point! The egg custard was tender and flavorful, topped with a brothy sauce and two pieces of pork cheek. Probably the least memorable of the dishes I had, but still good.  I thought maybe I'd leave without ordering dessert because I was full to the point of pain, but then I thought, \"Oh, what the hell,\" and ordered two half portions of dessert ($4 each) - the Strawberry Granita with creme fraiche-honey mousse and dates, and the Kyoto Rye Crepes with chocolate-banana jam, bananas, and candied kumquats. The kitchen, apparently sensing that I was up for a challenge, gifted me with a shot of their Peanut Muscovado milk ($2). I think, of all the items on the menu, the desserts seemed most like an afterthought. They were solid and fairly inventive, but not spectacular and surprising like some of the savory options. The granita was nicely textured and went well with the mousse (it was described to me as a riff on strawberries and cream), but the dates were misplaced in this dish -- their blander flavor and chewy texture didn't quite mesh with the granita/mousse. The rye crepes were a little sodden and bland, though I did VERY much like the chocolate-banana jam... again, the kumquat accompaniment seemed misplaced. Finally, the peanut buttery-sugary-creamy milk was a big shot of diabetes, but still very tasty! It was sort of the coup de grace of my whole meal, since it encapsulated the excess and whimsy of everything I'd just eaten.  The waitstaff are patient, kind, attentive, and eager to tell you what they're toting on their many trays and carts - I appreciated this as a solo diner. The ambiance is pretty casual, which I liked, and has sort of the nouveau-hipster-trendy look of a lot of restaurants in its genre. The musical selection really stayed in the background, which can be great or sad depending on your viewpoint; it didn't distract from the food, but didn't really set a mood.   And, finally, I LOVED the art in the bathroom -- witty illustrations of a \"French Onion Coup\" and another food pun.",

Because it's become impossible to get a reservation and since I can't physically stand around for 2-3-4 hours waiting for a table, I'll likely never eat here again. I got up 2 days in a row last week before 4am to get a reservation (supposedly, the story goes, reservations open at 4am) and started trying at 3:55am to get a table. Nope, no luck, no way, uh uh. Enjoy eating there while you can. I guess you have to know someone that owns the place or at the very least, works there, to eat there. Us regular folks are S.O.L.",

Really creative spot with just really good good creative food.Amazing desserts as well. I love earl gray and they had an earl gray panna cotta. Real good. Not too sweet and just the right amount of tea flavor.  Might be my new favorite place to spurge for some really amazing food that ! wont be able to find anywhere else.  FYI - my friends and i (party of 4) made a reservation at 6:30 Monday about a month and a half ago. It's busy and the buzz of the town right now.

Our waitress was awesome. \u00a0The concept of the dim sum style carts/ trays is genius. \u00a0A smart way for the restaurant to stack up a bill very quickly - every time something came out, we grabbed it! \u00a0The carts/trays were not consistent, however. \u00a0For some time there would be a flurry of food coming around and then for a long period of time there would be a lull where we were waiting for more food to come out. \u00a0Would be nice if there was a steady flow of food coming out.  PROVISIONS:  Oysters = Topped with something that reminded me of sauerkraut. \u00a02 stars.  blackberry marinated beets with goat cheese = 5 stars  guinea hen dumplings with aromatic broth = 3 stars. \u00a0Yelp, you deceived me! \u00a0Yes I expected 2 tiny dumplings so I was not surprised by the small size but I also expected 2 tiny dumplings of amazing, which I did not get. \u00a0They were good but wasn't crazy about them.  marvel stripe tomato with sweet corn, smoked salmon = 3 stars  duck liver mousse with almond biscuit = 10 STARS. \u00a0AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. \u00a0I could eat plates and plates of this by myself. \u00a0The biscuit is extremely buttery and the mousse is like eating a delicious, livery cloud.  haricot verts, pickled-egg salad, nuts &amp; seeds = 3 stars  garlic bread with burrata = 2 stars. \u00a0Most unspectacular of them all! \u00a0Where was the garlic?  haas avocado with seafood 'salsa' = 4 stars. \u00a0Plump, fresh seafood, perfectly cooked  kimchi-pork belly with tofu = 2 stars. \u00a0Pork belly was very tender and well cooked but this was basically a fancy version of kimchi jjigae... eating this made me want to go home and make my own (better and tastier) kimchi jjigae.  sweet corn &amp; garlic chive \"shortstack\" with mt. tam = 4 stars  chanterelle \"PANtatin\" cured pork jowl, candy cap topped with crispy mustard greens = 2 stars. \u00a0Smelled very sweet like maple but didn't taste sweet. \u00a0Interesting! \u00a0Unfortunately it only tasted ok.  COMMANDABLES: CA state bird with provisions = 3 stars. \u00a0Fried quail on top of a bed of pickled vegetables. \u00a0Not quite sure what they were. \u00a0Definitely get the full size. \u00a0If you know what a quail is, then you know how small the bird is.  oxtail curry, bok choy, french crepes = 4 stars.  cast iron pullet eggs, bread salad &amp; tomato with guanciale = 3 stars.  DESSERT: cheesecake japonaise, griddled figs in sherry &amp;honey = 4 stars  chocolate mint ice cream sandwich, raspberries = 3 stars  'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shot = 5 stars. \u00a0Tastes like a liquid Snickers bar!  Include 2 bottles of wine. \u00a0Total bill about $300 for 4 people. \u00a0(But as you can see we did kind of go all out...)  OVERALL: \u00a0This was a strong 3.5 stars for me. \u00a0I loved the concept and our waitress was great. \u00a0However since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I am rounding down to 3 stars because I don't have a desire to return. \u00a0I think it is definitely worth a try and I will certainly consider coming back when the menu changes.",

Difference is nothing should gross you out like Dim Sum can. \u00a0 Dim sum joint remixed is one way to describe the place but my thought was more of a Chef's Choice remixed kind of place but the difference is if there's something you like you can keep going back to it over and over again. \u00a0Let me tell you that is handy.

The extremely sweet and patient hostess told us we would have a table about 9:30pm. We expected this so no hard feelings and we took a walk around town and visited a piano bar nearby. We returned at 9:30pm and had to wait an hour longer for a table. The hostess was extremely apologetic and we were offered duck liver mousse with almond biscuit  and sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancake. Both were delicious and we were very pleasantly shocked to enjoy duck liver! Once we were seated service was efficient. We ordered the garlic bread with burrata (absolutely delicious and addictive soft pastry garlic bread and both dense and light as air cheese) BBQ rabbit &amp; spaetzle (deliciously bbq'd great balance of flavor), CA state bird with provisions (perfectly lightly breaded/fried tender quail) roasted bone marrow with chanterelles &amp; pink peppercorn (melts in your mouth). For dessert caramel nut tart, poppy seed crust, pears, whipped ricotta (rich, sweet, but not overly so) and the delicious and oddly refreshing world peace' peanut muscovado milk. The prices are surprisingly moderate for such imaginative and high quality ingredients. If we lived in San Fran we would Definitely be back many many times!!!",

Service was running a bit late (not surprising on a Friday night for this tiny place) so I checked in with the hostess Emily and she gave me a call when the table was ready so I could enjoy a quick drink nearby. She was great.  Definitely a fun way to do dinner with friends. It is like building your own tasting menu! You have to stay on your toes and make some quick decisions but over all we were very pleased. Some portions are very small (splitting a tiny palm sized pancake 4 ways!) but we ordered 16 dishes (a couple were double orders) and a bottle of wine and left more then satisfied. Our total was $65 per person (including tip). I think that is a great value.  Stand out items for me: cast iron eggs with guanicale eggplant fries ribs the state bird the ice cream sandwich  I wouldn't wait three hours or eat my meal standing up (like some of the walk ins were doing) for this meal.

After we found it, we got through the door into a packed little lobby. \u00a0On chatting to a few people in the queue, they asked us how many months ago we had booked or whether we had started queuing at 4pm that afternoon. \u00a0General laughter when we explained what we were trying to do. \u00a0We rocked up at 8.30pm with our daughter. \u00a0Anyway, to cut a long story short, 10 minutes later we were sitting at the counter in the kitchen. \u00a0Best seats in the house if you like food. \u00a0Just proves its always worth being nice to the hosts.  So after a great chat with the sous chef who was working the station directly in front of us we understood how it all worked and had a bit of the background.  Our take on the food was this:  Fried bread and burrata. \u00a0Really not very good if you are from Europe and can tte hold of Burrata. \u00a0This was a Californian product that the chef readily admitted it was not real burrata. \u00a0So all in all rather odd and not very tasty.  But that was the only duff dish that we had. \u00a0The quail was good but we really enjoyed the pork belly , the salmon tartare and the pancakes ( which were outstanding - we tried 3 types). \u00a0All in all I think between three of us we tried 18 things, so we made a pretty good dent in the menu.  I have to say the service was outstanding. \u00a0Sitting at the kitchen meant we got to have a really interesting chat with the kitchen team, all of whom were absolutely charming and very happy to chat whilst cooking.  So, in summary, a really interesting concept that had a fun buzz about it and delivers good to very good food. \u00a0We are very happy we went.",

State Bird doesn't disappoint. The food was delicious and the service very friendly &amp; prompt without being pushy. So good, it inspired me to finally make a Yelp review.  As noted by others, the space is small in a comfy way, and reservations are key. When I first checked, there was nothing avail for 2 weeks. The online system through urban spoon is pretty efficient, and after checking a couple of times in the day, we landed a table for that night. I really liked that the hostess called later in the day to confirm and was gracious in taking time to answer some questions.   Right when we walked in the feeling was relaxed and friendly. Nothing pretentious here. There are great, detailed reviews from others that cover the food - and it's true, everything we tried was sooooo good. The tuna and quinoa was yummy. I loved the guinea hen dumplings. Also, there's a nice tea selection, which is a good complement to the dishes. I can't say enough about the people though - super welcoming and nice from the minute we arrived til we left thanking the chefs. \u00a0It was perfect for a late night dinner after a movie (easy walk from Kabuki), though we might have needed at least one of the larger plates if we were there for a regular dinner.

They serve their food dim sum style (you can order al la carte also); some come in the little dim sum carts and some come in a tray. The dim sum style is great for sharing so everyone gets to try more variety of food.   The 3 of us ate 17 dishes including dessert and none of them were disappointing, although some were definitely better than the others.

We got smart.   - We ordered less from the menu this time; we skipped the pancakes entirely- they were too soggy and unimpressive.   -Ricotta Dumplings: light, fluffy, and pillowy. Highly recommend  - The ribs were still smokey and yummy.   - Quail Eggs: i love quail eggs but these were not what i was envisioning. I'd skip this  - Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth: honestly, just as delicious as the state bird. They walked around with these in a tray and they are $1.50 per bowl. I could easily have gobbled 10 of these. Dangerous  - I've grown to like the Peking Duck. It's very respectable as long as you don't think you're eating Peking Duck. Think....duck confit. Yum  - Ahi Poke: I like but i'm a poke snob. It ain't Hawaii. But it was pretty good  - Duck liver mousse with Financiers: silky and light. Good for a starter  - The ice cream sandwiches this time were earl grey; \u00a0i wasn't a huge fan. If they have chocolate ice cream sandwiches, i'd highly recommend them.   Even if you have a reservation, be sure to get there a few mins early.  If you're the first seating, don't freak out by the sight of the loooong line. Most of these ppl are in line for walk-ins. Someone from the restaurant will make a short announcement about forming a line for reservation holders and you'll be seated the moment the door opens. LIsten up for that.   Walk-ins who don't make the first seating (at the bar) will probably have to wait 45-60 mins for the next seating.   For the top new restaurant in the country, the service here is friendly and efficient; no pretentiousness or snootiness.   Love",

Amazing interior and even more delicious food! \u00a0We walked in at 5:45 and already an hour wait at this tiny place, no bigs for us as we just went and had a glass at dosa.  The food was delicious I believe we had 12 plates and all were yummy (although my table said the state bird was the least tasty). \u00a0Of course the brie pancake and burrata were the highlights for this vegit!  Worth the wait!",

    "review_text": "I guess all the hype messed my taste buds up?! I really wanted to love it but half the tapas were meh and the other half amazing. How is that even possible you ask? Well, the fresh oyster with kohlrabi kraut and sesame just seemed to mask the oysters flavor and the burrata (while delicious on its own) was served with what seemed to be a microwaved garlic bread. It was as if it had been over cooked and was super chewy and bordering on the tough side. :( Sadly dessert was also a disappointment. We were standing in the kitchen area and noticed a lot people ordered the earl grey ice cream sandwich with figs so we figured it must be good. \u00a0The texture was really nice but it was extremely sweet for my taste.   With that being said, I will say that the fish collar, pork belly with winter citrus, hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini and the sourdough, sauerkraut pecorino &amp; ricotta pancake were amazing!  In continuing with the good...the atmosphere was really hip and had a comfortable vibe in the air. I liked the dim sum style of serving and loved being in the kitchen while I ate where I could interact with the chef and servers. I think this place is worth a try as their menu is constantly changing!",

    "review_text": "I give it 3.5 stars but rounded up because of the yummy ice cream sandwich and tartar. I have had my eye on this place for over a year and I just thought it was impossible to ever come here because you cant call for reservations and doing it online is impossible unless a spot magically appears on a weekday night. It says there are not reservation for months ahead so that seemed pointless. My sister had gone one time and waited an hour for the open seating and it worked so I tried that as well. Just like Orenchis status, I got in line at 4:30pm on Sunday, an hour before opening and stood in line. Our group was probably the 7th party so we had to be seated. That hour is pretty miserable since it is cold but I guess you can watch them make the food. Origin SF is right across which I hear is the next poppin club. You wouldnt even know that it is State Bird because there is no sign. I wonder how Ryan Gosling found this place haha. I wonder which godly seat he sat in when that photo circulated among my friends.   The doors opened and I am not sure if the huge line behind me was able to all be seated. If not, it would suck because the second wave would have to wait until someone from the first wave finished, which would be 90 minutes later. I say if you miss the first boat or you know you wont make the first round, save yourself some time and come around 7 or so because by then there were a few empty seats. I am not sure if those would be used for reservations or for walk-ins but there was no line outside when I left at 7:30pm. So at 5:30pm we were seated at a booth and it actually looked a lot more modest looking than I expected. I was imagining some fine dining but it felt quite hipster SF in there. It is dim sum style so people come around with trays and a cart. You can also order from the menu which we did as well. The waiters are attentive and nice but it is sorta hard to catch their eye when you want one of their dishes. The items definitely started to add up and each of the six ended up paying $40 including tax and tip. We got the following from the dim sum items:  1) Beef strips- we ordered two of these and only one was necessary. Tasted good but nothing crazy. 2) Mushroom ravioli- One order comes with one ravioli so we cut two into four pieces each. I dont think the tiny size allowed me to really appreciate what I was eating. I would pass.  3) Oysters- there was some ginger type thing on top that none of us liked so we just ate the oyster. It was fresh but it was $3 for a tiny one. Dont think the size/taste justified the price.  4) Tar Tar with some type of fish- I thought this was good because the quinoa was crunchy and added great taste and texture. I recommend.  5) Mushroom porridge- Not my fave.  6) Garlic bread with burrata- Not my fave. The burrata was just way too much.  7) Fried pork belly- this is just fried fat with some pork. It is like what you would get at a Chinese restaurant.  8) Salmon- The presentation was nice since it was a long strip of salmon but it tasted average.   From the menu: 1) Fried Quail- this is what the restaurant is named after and I couldnt really taste the quail since the fried breading was just too much. Unfortunately not my fave. You can do half orders since each order comes with four so we did 1.5 orders. 2) Duck Fried Rice- This was one of the better dishes since the duck was flavorful but you can probably get this at another Chinese restaurant.  3) Halibut tartar- this was my favorite savory dish. The seaweed was the perfect holder of the tartar and it was so crunchy good. I loved mixing it with the fish and the avocado! Great dish and I highly recommend it.  4) Poppy seed cake- this dessert comes with little cubes of this cake that has a denser texture than a regular cake. It was good but by far my most favorite item was the ice cream sandwich.  5) Ice cream sandwich- I LOVEDDD this. You can do half orders as well but we just did one order that came with four pieces. The sandwich part is like rice crispies which is something I have never had before. It was a great texture. It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate chunk pieces within the ice cream. Ahhh it was heavenly and I loved it!  I have had tapa places and I feel like because of the appearance of exclusivity, it has been a little overhyped. Some dishes were a hit but others will make you feel confused on whether you are judging the dish correctly.  **TIPS** 1) Come 45min-1 hour before opening so you can snag a spot in the first round. If you know you cant make it, just try at 7pm hopefully. 2) Go with a group so you can try different things. If you only go with one person, you can try to eat everything since the dishes are small but you wont finish it all and you wont be able to try as much. I think a good size group is 4-6 if you dont mind splitting multiple little dishes. It will add up though. 3) You musttt get the Halibut tartar and the ice cream sandwich. I would throw in the duck fried rice for funsi",

That's the only time I heard they let reservation times out! So wake up in the middle of the night.   The food here is AMAZING and I love the vibe of the place. It's great for sharing so our group of 4 people was perfect. We were able to order almost everything on the menu and share. Also everything is fairly priced and you won't break the bank dining here. They have a menu that you can order stuff from the kitchen or they also have their staff with a cart (like at dim sum) going around and marking your tab off if you choose one of the items from the cart.  Now onto the food:  Garlic bread with buratta - Must get, sooo good and that buratta is the best cheese ever!   Smoked black cod pancake - good tasty little pancakes with fish  CA state bird with provisions - Definitely have to get this! delicious  Pork riblets glazed in their own juices - could do without. tastes like any other ribs I've had at other places.  spicy dungeness crab kimchee yuba with smoked egg - good, the kimchee gives it an asian kick to it. tasty though.  Mushroom farro spezzato with whipped ricotta - super good! love mushrooms  steak tartare Caesar lettuce wraps - this was good but tasted heavily of the Caesar  Raw Oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame - my least fave of the night. definitely wouldn't do this again. not that great, nothing special.  Wild king salmon tartare - tasty, I love anything salmon  Smoked trout and avocado chip and dip - really good because I love anything with avocado in it. fun to eat with the chips  Hamachi avocado and seaweed cracker - I liked this a lot, I love hamachi and the seaweed cracker was good  Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - really good, rich and tasty, wish the biscuit wasn't as sweet though.  Bacon wrapped duck gizzard and lettuce wrap - new item they were trying and I must say it was delicious. gizzard wasn't gamey at all  Roasted bone marrow - one of my faves of the night. sooo good and rich and yummy. must get.  Chocolate ice cream sandwich - Must get this to end a perfect meal! the best ice cream sandwiches I've ever had!",

    "review_text": "This is more of a place for twenty somethings who like to experiment with interesting combination of food flavors instead of the traditional boring restaurant food. \u00a0The service is super friendly which is their strong point and the dim sum concept is interesting. \u00a0However when it comes to food quality vs price ratio, I would rather eat at Gary Danko or Massa anytime anyday. \u00a0You can easily spend as much as you gulp through the tiny dimsum dishes costing between $5 to $13 each (mostly in the upper end) plus the wine.   Of all their dishes, I did enjoy their mini pancakes, beef tongue pastrami (because I like beef tongue in any style) \u00a0and, to a lesser degree, their bite size pork belly and almond cake with foie gras mousse (ok, nothing amazing).  In general, I would describe their dishes as interesting instead of delicious or refined. \u00a0Too many of their dishes are not well made. While there is some interesting flavor, it is often one dimensional, overpowering or lacking balance. \u00a0For example their namesake dish \"statebird provisions\" consists of an overly deep fried quail (hard &amp; dry) with a slice of tasteless dry provolone like cheese over lemon rosemary marinated onion. \u00a0Aside from having too hard of a crust &amp; lacking any savory taste, the only flavor we got was the sour lemon. Another disappointing dish is the tasteless burata cheese (too dry and plain) on a crusty boring bread, the only taste we got was from the peppermill. \u00a0Their potato chip &amp; dip of smoked trout with avocado &amp; onion is interesting but far from being amazing or delicious. Their tartars are just average while their maitake duck fried rice is disappointing.   That said this place is fun for younger diners who may not feel as comfortable eating in more formal restaurants as the atmosphere here is very informal and super friendly. \u00a0They offer a nice list of wines to choose from. You'd feel comfortable eating with your fingers and wiping the grease on your tshirts as long as you don't mind the high bill at the end.",

Here are some details about our first experience:   In September, my boyfriend and I walked in with no reservations at around 6:45pm and were told it would be about a 2 hour wait. We went up the block to Dosa for cocktails (good drinks btw), and received a call around 8:15pm. What we ended up being offered was the standing room-only ledge by the door.   It ended up being a great experience. We were able to watch the chefs prepare each dish and got first dibs of everything. Everyone was friendly and attentive. The food was so flavorful and creative. I loved the small plates/ dim sum concept because it makes you try things that you wouldn't necessarily order. Some highlights for me were the duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, the guinea hen dumplings, and \"statebird.\"The two of us ended up getting about 8 dishes and we were absolutely stuffed.   Can't wait to try one of the savory pancakes tonight and some of the new seasonal dishes. I will definitely report back!",

    "review_text": "My friend made a reservation TWO months ago at 4 in the morning and when we saw the line as we arrived, it was totally worth it. (Though 2 months was still a really long wait!)  We got seated immediately and was explained that it's pretty much dim sum style where they come around and let you know what they have and you can choose if you want it or not, and you can also order off their menu. We got:  Rabbit and Fontina Croquette: I liked this. It was a small piece of well cooked rabbit wrapped in a thin layer of cheese and some crumb coating. I could have had a few more of those.  Smoked Sturgeon Cream with thin cracker things: i really liked this one. It was really light and a good starter of the meal. The crackers were super crispy and when added the dip, there was a really nice light smokey flavor  Guinea Hen Dumpling with Aromatic Broth: This one was pretty good. It pretty much tasted like a dumpling in a really good broth and it totally reminded me of something but I couldn't figure it out and then I realized that it kind of taste like pho, but as good as it was, I rather pay $6 for a whole bowl of pho instead of $3 for a little dumpling.  Hamachi-avocado and seaweed cracker: I liked this one, but it pretty much tasted like sushi. I liked the crispiness of the seaweed (I think they fried it) and the hamachi was fresh and the avocado sauce went really well with it. My friend really liked this one.  CA State Bird with Provisions: this one you have to order off the menu and I always have to try what a restaurant is know for. It pretty much tasted like a really delicate fried chcken. It's a really light bird (It's quail in case you didn't know what CA's \u00a0state bird is lol) and wasn't too meat-y. The sauce, lemon and onion that came with it flavored it really well, but other than that, it was kind of like a good piece of fried chicken.  Smoked Trout Quinoa \"Tabouleh\": This one was one of my favorites. The quinoa was really good - nice and crispy and the smoked trout is an amazing flavor to add to it! YUM!  Pork Belly Grape Salad: i'm usually all in for fatty meat parts, but this one was a little too much. I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly itself - I didn't like the pieces that they chose to give us, but the vinagar-y flavor was really good and sad to say, but the grapes (though only a few of them) were probably better than the meat.  Garlic Bread with Burrata: I don't really know what burrata is (cheese?), but it was really good. It was super creamy and cheesy and was really good with the warm bread. It was a tad on the greasy side, but the combination of cheese and bread was really good.  Chocolate Cake Roll: Super rich chocolate. If you like dark chocolate, this is definitely for you. The cake itself was light and fluffy, but it hits you with a huge coco flavor! The orange clove added a unique flavor to it. It was sweet enough so it was good, but also a tad bitter for contrast.  Poppy Seed Ice Cream Sandwich: You know you're a total dessert fan when you think it's the best dish of the entire night. I'm so glad we got this one and was thinking about ordering a second for just myself. The poppy seed ice cream was delicious and whatever the sandwich part of the dessert is was lightly sweetend and chewy. I didn't really taste any of the fruit flavors it said it came with, but I was happy with just the poppy seed ice cream and it's sandwich parts.  Overall, it was a cool experience. When they describe the food, they mention a ton of ingredients that i'm not familiar with or can even pernounce and there are like a ton of different ingredients in each dish! For the most part, you can just go with what looks good. They were all pretty good, though I felt despite the complicated ingredients, nothing was really thaaat unque and it reminded me of everything I've tried before. All the dishes are pretty pricey (a small dish for $10?!?) but it's worth the try if you're there anyways. The servers are super nice and helpful and the food comes around more than once so you don't have to worry about passing on any dish at the moment because they will come back. I might come back to try some different things... or for the poppy seed ice cream!!",

    "review_text": "The name is what threw me. I heard it was good, very good in fact, but that name made it sound so trendy in an Audubon Society kind of way that I thought I'd wait and read the reviews. Then of course, the New York Times praised it to high heaven a couple of weeks ago, so it was time to go. By sheer luck, there was an open table available last Thursday, so Jamie W. and I decided to forgo the Soup Company and splurge a bit on a school night. It's a surprisingly modest-looking place, smallish, in the struggling Lower Fillmore area, but what immediately strikes you is the open kitchen and prep area where chefs Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski and their staff were busily preparing all their specialty dishes in full view.  I knew almost immediately that this was going to be good. To experience a wide variety of their special delicacies, Brioza and Krasinski smartly decided to take a tapas approach. You can either order \u00e0 la carte off their plank menu which gets stashed under the table, or from a cart or a large tray dim sum-style, where various small dishes are offered in the $5 to $8 range. Or you can do it like us and order both ways in order to try as much as possible within one meal. A lot of tempting choices, but we knew we had to tackle their signature \"Commandable\" dish, the $16 CA State Bird with Provisions, which is appropriately a crispy spiced quail piled atop onions stewed in lemon and rosemary (see photo).  It had been so long since I had fried chicken that it was the perfect bite to have at that moment with the puckery onions a nice counterbalance to the crispiness of the quail. It was over all too soon. The next dish was a bit more exotic, the $14 Cumin Lamb with Scallions, Figs and Zucchini, stir-fried and casually flavorful, it was easy to devour (see photo). Complementing the two protein-dominated dishes was the $12 Cast Iron Mushrooms, Eggplant, Dahl and Cauliflower, a hearty veggie mix simply executed and perfectly savory (see photo). Throughout the meal, the cart would stroll by with all sorts of delectable items or a waitress with a big tray would present another trio of dishes. It was all becoming quite overwhelming, especially on a school night.  But we wanted the full experience and \u00a0grabbed the $5 Guinea Hen Ravioli in Duck Broth, which was just a couple of bites for the both of us but still quite a treat (see photo). We also tried the $6 Ahi Tuna Tartare which was mixed with Quinoa (see photo). The contrast in texture and flavor was nice, and it was almost like having a Hawaiian mini-poki salad. Even with five dishes under our belts...literally, we still felt a need to try their $8 desserts. Both were splendid. The first was the Sweet Corn-Coconut Cake with Blueberries and a dollop of Buttermilk Cream, a homespun treat that wouldn't be out of place at a county fair (see photo). The second was even better, the Cocoa Nib-Verbena Ice Cream Sandwich, cut in quarters, with Blackberries (see photo). The perfect ending.  FOOD - 5 stars...incredible variety, great batting average on flavors and a sense of culinary adventure uncommon even in this city...and I didn't feel stuffed at the end AMBIANCE - 4 stars...casual and not too noisy considering how busy they were SERVICE - 4 stars...attentive and informed TOTAL - 5 stars...truly unique and the tapas approach lets you try more than you would expect for a little over $40 per person",

    "review_text": "I am very excited to give this restaurant a 5 star review! There's been a lot of hype and it was hard to get in. But by luck a friend of mine invited me to take a spot of a guy who couldn't make it. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Thankfully there were more hit than misses. I won't go into the dishes because I think past reviewers did it justice. What I liked what the dim sum concept as well as being able to ordered off the menu.   Many restaurants operates on titles and responsibilities. You have \u00a0your main server, runners, bussers and so forth. What I liked from the get go is that our server Ben said we can flag anyone down and they would be able to help us and that it's a communal style service. I love that! Our dining experience was what it was because of Ben's knowledge of the menu. He didn't just regurgitate what the dish was but talked about what it is, how it is made, and all the little details that we liked and absorbed. I particularly like the chewiness of the garlic bread with buratta. We asked one of the dim sum passers and he explained it as yeasted bread that is fried and baked. But when we asked Ben he went into great detailed on what kind of bread it was, how it was made, how it was fried then baked. That was what was drawing us in.  I'm just so glad State Bird lived up to the hype. It may or may not be the best meal of your life but it was worthy of all 5 stars. For that I thank you State Bird for show casing your love of food. I could taste the love that went into the food!",

    "review_text": "Irrefutably hip and impossibly hyped, State Bird is an experience worth having, even if it does take calm perseverance to wait out the long lines or play the often-frustrating reservation roulette on their web site. \u00a0I chose the latter, and squeezed in after about four months wait.  Squeezing is the first thing you do at the Bird - the passageway between the front door and dining room forces you to forge a narrow path through the teeming bar, cramped with festive folks getting the prize of quick counter service. \u00a0The dining room itself is an homage to industrial chic, with its concrete walls, warehouse floor, and black-and-white photographs. \u00a0  The food literally comes at you from all sides, almost sensory overload, but oh-so-incredible. \u00a0You have a plethora of food choices, between the printed menu and the beautifully presented small plates that dart past, around and over you on trays and carts commanded by knowledgeable, personable servers. \u00a0  Our favorite item was on the menu, a short stack of sweet corn and garlic chive pancakes topped with transcendent Mt. Tam cheese, a moist, rich, sweet and salty phenomenon...and gone so soon. \u00a0The other menu item we indulged in was the rice-crusted red trout with mandarin oranges, hazelnuts, and garum brown butter. \u00a0The flavor explosion defied categorization and defined eclectic, and we loved it. \u00a0  The dim sum style cart and tray service yielded two superstars. \u00a0First, a perfect marriage of grilled shrimp and avocado, with a dousing of black garlic aioli and the ideal, heavenly accompaniment of crispy nori chips. \u00a0 Second, a warm garlic fried bread (the forced sophistication of your favorite carnival fried dough) topped liberally with coarsely ground peppercorns (roasted to sweetness) and other mystically unidentifiable spices and then covered with a creamy, gooey burrata. \u00a0Need I say more? \u00a0Need I HAVE more?  The answer, fortunately, was yes. \u00a0Dessert featured a brand new entry to their delectable roster, a chocolate-gingersnap pudding with toasted coconut-chocolate-almond crunch and topped with a roasted and caramelized sliver of delicata squash. \u00a0Words fail me in describing it further: \u00a0it's as good as it sounds. \u00a0Alongside, we tried the \"World Peace,\" a small shot glass of peanut muscavado milk which should be the new norm for palate cleansing. \u00a0It was also the perfect \u00a0nightcap.",

They do dishes dim sum style (so you can get a taste of everything!), and I'm pretty sure they sprinkle everything with magical fairy rainbow crack dust because everything is delicious and tasty and I would gladly give up my firstborn child (sorry imaginary kid, momma's gotta eat!) to eat there every single day. Their food is incredibility unique and creative, like a redheaded conjoined-twin snowflake made out of unicorn smiles and Ryan Gosling, AND IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER PERFECTLY. Next time I go there, I'll make sure not to eat any meals the day of because I wish my stomach could fit more of their delicious food. It's actually decently priced for the quality/care/creativity (they could charge a lot more because of the hype. I mean, honestly, it's worth donating a first-born to.). We spent about $110 for 2 people for a meal I'll never forget.  Actually my review should read - NO ONE GO HERE (so I can get a reservation instead).",

    "review_text": "Given the enormous press recognition State Bird has received and the plethora of Yelp reviews, I'm not sure how much I can add, so I'll limit my review to some general musings and tips. (The food, service, and experience was all very good, as evinced by my five star rating.)  1. Yes reservations are extremely difficult, but with patience, time, and the ability to be spontaneous, they are quite possible. \u00a0For two days straight, I refreshed the reservation page throughout the day and noticed that same-night reservations would occasionally pop up as people cancel. \u00a0The second day, a prime time 7:30 spot opened up and I jumped on it.  2. I wouldn't get the quail again. \u00a0I've had similar type fried quail at other restaurants, and the one here really is not that unique or remarkable. \u00a0I definitely understand trying it--it is the restaurant's namesake after all--but there are enough other interesting things to try that I would stay away from the state bird next time.  3. Prices are quite reasonable. \u00a0The NY times article suggested $70 for two people, sans-alcohol and tip. \u00a0Gf and I were \"stuffed\" after $40 pre-tip and sans alcohol. \u00a0I say \"stuffed\" because we managed to fit some bi-rite ice cream in us afterwards, but we definitely were very full.   4. The food that is ordered from the regular menu (not dim-sum style) takes a while to prepare. \u00a0Order them early so you won't be sitting around waiting for them and wondering how much more of the small plates to order!  5. Why did it take so long for a dim-sum styled Western restaurant?",

The bf and I actually attempted coming here a little before 5:30pm on my birthday with the hopes of scoring a table, but failed miserably. By the time we parked, which was roughly around 5:18pm, the line was already ridiculously long. Not knowing the normal protocol, we thought the line was moving rather quickly and that we were going to actually get a spot, but little did we know, by the time we reached the host, we were informed that they were all sold out until 11pm and will take down our name and number if anyone cancels for the night (but of course, the waitlist before us was massive as well). Bummed, we searched for another restaurant and enjoyed my bday meal elsewhere but swore to come back another day to try again. Luckily, we knew someone with a reservation a few days after that they could not make, so we took it!  Let me tell you, even with a reservation in hand, we waited a good 30 min for the tables to pay and be entirely cleared. (Note: we actually arrived an hour earlier than our reservation but they would not seat us until our reservation time.) After sitting, we were informed that we were suggested to order a few items from the menu but around 12 items were dim-sum style and will be presented to us on carts all throughout dinner. Being too excited and mostly too hungry, we ordered the CA State Bird w/ Provisions \u00a0(half), Cumin Lamb &amp; Baby Octopus, Duck Ham-Pecan Pancake, and the Curry Rabbit Roti. From the carts being pushed around, we tried a fish egg w/potato chips dish, salmon tartare w/ cucumber, one dumpling ( I forgot what was inside), a rabbit croquette ball, and a pork belly &amp; grapes concoction dish. Since the menu changes so often, you probably will not see any of these items again, but honestly, they were all delicious and unique in their own ways. As long as the dish is filled with ingredients you like, dont hesitate to try it and be mind-blown!  My favorite from the entire dinner was definitely the salmon tartare and the curry rabit roti. These two plates were at out-of-this-worth level of amazing. We also ended with the Buckwheat Bao for dessert, which was filled with Coconut Cream &amp; Carrot Jam, and honestly, I am so glad that the waitress took a good 5 minutes trying to talk us into getting it. I am a dessert junky, but I was seriously so full that I was about to blow. Best decision EVER.  All I say is, State Bird was amazing so get your reservations in early or be prepared to show up at 3pm to avoid the long line and guarantee your spots for that night!",

The staff was thoughtful and passed out rich hot chocolate to the patiently waiting freezing patrons. Once seated, you are immediately offered their first dish.   If I have to compare my experience of State Bird to something familiar, I would have to say its a bit like Dim Sum. The kitchen whips up several rotating items throughout the night and come table to table to offer their items of the evening. It was quite the experience.   I sat at the bar so the chef was so kind to answer all my food questions, it was also a treat to watch the kitchen staff prepare dish after dish. A few of my favorites were, the state bird, the hamachi seaweed, mushrooms, and of course the desserts.   Definitely worth the wait in line since we were not able to get reservations.",

    "review_text": "I finally secured a spot for the BF and me at State Bird's... for my Birthday Dinner! =D  Granted I had to rush over and get in line around 4:50 because I didn't have a reservation. There were already quite a few people in line by the time I arrived, and I ended up waiting 40 minutes freezing my butt off in order to get in on a Tuesday night. Unfortunately once they opened the doors and I got to the hostess, she informed me that she couldn't seat me without my boyfriend (still on his way over from work). Thankfully she was lenient with me since it was my birthday and let me sit and wait at the bar for him. Thank you!!  Once the BF arrived we started ordering:  State Bird (Fried Quail): 5/5 - This was my favorite dish of the night. I don't have quail often, and I've NEVER had it fried but this was perfect! The meat was tender, the breading was light and not oily at all and they placed the bird on a bed of deliciously divine onions! They added some parmesan cheese slivers on top as well which were fun to chomp on between bites of meat and onion. MUST ORDER THIS!  Hamachi with avocado sauce and radish: 4/5 - A solid dish. Cubes of fresh fish on an edible seaweed/crunchy thing with some avocado sauce. Tasty and light.  Pork Belly with tangy addicting sauce: 5/5 - My second favorite, and I'm not even a big fan of pork belly! My boyfriend was in love with this one, and I found it hard to find fault with this dish because it was so delectable! The meat to fat content was perfect, and the outside of the chunks were crispy while the inside remained deliciously soft. The sauce underneath was so tangy and addicting, I was scooping it up and drinking it and dipping everything I could in there because I didn't want to waste a drop!  Dumpling in aromatic broth: 4/5 - A very cute single dumpling for each person =) I really enjoyed this one, it was filled with some sort of poultry if I remember correctly but what really impressed me was the broth which was super aromatic and had a subtle lemongrass taste.  Salmon tartare with crunchy quinoa furikake and cucumber: 2/5 - My least favorite... The crunchy quinoa put me off, but the salmon tartare part was pretty good. I love cucumbers but it was hard to eat them when they were covered in crunchies..  Red Trout with citrus sauce: 4/5 - Now this was some great fish! It almost looks like salmon because the color is such a vivid red. No bones, the meat was very soft and tender, and it was nicely paired with the citrus/brown butter sauce.   At the end of our meal we received two peanut muscovado milks for free because it was my bday =) The service was great and everyone was very nice and accommodating which was awesome! The only issue is some of the dishes that are not on the menu (the \"dim sum\" ones) can take awhile to reach you but it makes for a nice, leisurely meal. Thanks for a great birthday meal SBP!",

You also have to get the State Bird because it's their signature dish but I thought it was less memorable than many of the other items. For dessert I would say definitely try the ice cream sandwich and the Bao with coconut cream.   Wine list is quite short so I would suggest bringing in your own bottle for a reasonable corkage of $20.   Definitely lives up to the hype!",

    "review_text": "After several late night/early morning reservation booking attempts and having to give away my reservation a month and a half ago at the last minute, I FINALLY went to State Bird Provisions last night!  i would not advise going without a reservation. I've heard stories of 4 hour wait times and I saw firsthand some walk-ins eating their meals standing. BUT they are closing for a few weeks starting August 10th to expand the place so hopefully that'll help with the wait/reservation situation.  Regardless, this place is worth any reservation/wait-time hoops you have to jump. Very rarely do I find that places meet the hype and almost never do they exceed it! State Bird Provisions is amazing on all fronts.  There are around 20 menu items that you can order plus another 12 dim-sum style items that come around on carts and trays (all explained to you by really knowledgeable and patient waiters and all labeled with the price so you don't feel at all hoodwinked).  Everything we had was delicious, here's what I can remember though not all will be available when you go... From the menu: - the state bird: nor particularly meaty but the fried skin was insane. Oh, and the onions and cheese! All worked perfectly together. - anchovy pancake: I don't like anchovies but this was incredible. Makes me want to start putting anchovies on everything but I have a feeling it won't be as delicious as they make it here - sourdough sauerkraut and ricotta pancake: another winner, served with dehydrated sauerkraut in a sort of salt form. Just beyond anything I could ever fathom. - the beef: served with broccoli, bok choy and cooked a perfect medium rare - the duck with cloud ears: this was probably the closest to traditional versions; still delicious - quail eggs: I am not big on egg dishes but this was so tasty - chocolate pistachio torte: good but not as good as.... - chocolate ice cream sandwich: the \"bread\" of this sandwich is a delectable white brownie; mind-blowing.  From the carts/trays: - scallops with avocado: I wish someone would try to drown me in it so I would be challenged to eat my way out - the clams: another seafood hit - liver mousse with almond biscuits: the mousse was light as air and the bread balls (sweet like cornbread!) were perfection - ahi tuna with avocado on a seaweed crisp: I'm probably not describing this accurately at all but it was divine and a favorite of our table (but really, everything was)  What I wish we had gotten: - the fried oysters looked terrific - the lobster salad (genuinely regretting this) - cherry granita dessert - kim chi - everything else  While it was hard to notice anything else but the amazing and inspired food, the service was beyond reproach. The staff was so nice and patient (we were a bit overwhelmed but needing to make snap decisions with the dim sum options, especially in the beginning and they were happy to re-explain the system or give us our time). The waiters and even the chef himself (genius!) come around very frequently to check on us, refill water, replace our plates every few dishes, provide recommendations. All around stellar service.  You honestly can't go wrong in this place. I earnestly believe every dish is a winner. Coming back here in a few weeks!",

    "review_text": "Fun and novel concept, great variety of unique and tasty dishes. Spendy but not super spendy. Hipster atmosphere.  There are 2 kinds of really great restaurants. The ones that are constantly striving to be unique and different, changing their menu constantly. And the kind that really only do a small handful of dishes, but have perfected them over many years. This is the first kind.  Long waits. Reservations were booked weeks ahead. We went on a Saturday, lined up for opening, then got quoted a 9pm seating.  The food: the best thing is really the variety. Overall, I felt no dish was really done to perfection, even though everything was enjoyable. Which is what happens when dishes rotate so often, everything is pretty good but nothing you fall in love with.  We had most of what was going around that night, like the garlic bread with burrata, guinea hen dumpling with broth, ricotta dumplings, oysters, duck liver mouse, grilled octopus, scallops, quail eggs, a tofu skin dish, as well as ordering the trout and quail off the menu. Most of it was very good, but no dish was OMG OUTSTANDING. I particularly liked the guinea hen dumpling, mostly because of the broth. The octopus was also nice, but we've had a better version at Son of a Gun in LA. The scallops were a bit strange, I enjoyed it but my wife did not. Fried pork belly - this is the heart attack plate. I like pork belly that's been braised then finished in the oven. But fried is okay too.  Ice cream sandwich was tasty, but the \"macaron\" was a bit hard to eat because it did not pierce easily with the fork.  Their food tended to be on the vinegar-y side, with the use of pickled or preserved items to bring in acid to the dish. Which is fine, but just so you know in case you hate pickles for whatever reason.  Sat at the bar and chatted with the chefs while they were cooking, which was fun. The atmosphere is very personal. Almost too personal. If you didn't accept a dish a waiter was bringing around, it felt like you were hurting their feelings a little bit.  Mostly the appeal of this place is the ability to eat 10 different dishes by looking at them instead of reading a description on a menu. Would go back if wait times were more reasonable and we lived closer.",

    "review_text": "I was really excited to take my sister to State Bird while she was visiting from New York. We had read all the hype and were intrigued by the dim sum style serving. However, we were completely disappointed.   The pancake dishes are excellent. Unfortunately, the night we went they didn't have good pancake options (at least compared to others I talked to who recommended certain ones to us but they were no longer on the menu.) The other dishes are mediocre especially many of the asian inspired dishes. The combination of flavors don't go well together. It's almost as if they are trying too hard to come up with interesting combinations.  If you want to eat right when you sit down, you won't have a problem. The food comes out immediately. The drawback of the dim sum style serving is the servers push food on you and almost make you feel guilty if you don't want it. They do a good job trying to sell you on each dish. If you want to have a quiet and relaxing dinner this is not the place to go. You will likely be in and out fairly quickly and it's difficult to have any conversations at the table without being constantly interrupted by the serving carts.   The worst part about our experience was our waiter. He was very friendly when we first sat down and throughout our meal but when we asked for the check much earlier than he expected he turned completely cold. We couldn't believe it. Clearly we didn't eat enough food or spend enough money for him and his attitude was shocking. It just left us with a bad taste in our mouth walking out of the restaurant.   This restaurant could be a lot better if they had more pancake options. Usually there are three on the menu, and they could easily double it. They are unique and very tasty.",

You get to smell everything as it comes off of the line. And you get the entire kitchen telling you exactly what to eat and why.   The curse part was trying to will my stomach to digest food faster so I could, in turn, stuff my face with more delicious things. We had to stop after trying 18 dishes. I think I could've done 20, but I also think I might've ruptured something by then, so I quit while I was (mostly) ahead.  It's basically a culinary orgasm, over and over with each new dish. Pickled this, fermented that, added into this other thing you may have had before, but never prepared like this. Yes, it's near impossible to get a table here. But you should try.

When we finally did get in, we were fortunately enough to be seated at the bar but in our own little section with only us and the bartender who ended up being our spiritual food and drink guide for the evening.

Unfortunately it didn't look like a crazy night, bad I had to send a dish back and that was the state birds with provisions. Completely rare and under cooked and they had to serve up another one. Sad.  Most of the foods were heavy definitely need to drink lots of wine. Dim sum style foods I would have expected to have a little more balance between light foods and heavy foods.   Basically tried a couple of salads, like the quinoa salmon (interesting texture), but taste was just ok. This was same with the oyster with some spicey sauce.   The fried bread with burrata was good, but the portion was definitely more fit for 4.  Steak Tartar was interesting in terms of taste ass it had some papaya in it (?) Definitely had better....  Something else was the tofu skin with some tomato based sauce and that was ok.   Had the original pancake type thing with some special salt, but it just tasted like fried batter and cheese.  For desert had the walnut tart with fresh asian tart... Thought it would be a little lighter in taste but also very heavy. The asian part was a complement to the tart rather than a balance.   Overall I think it should be a try, but get 4 people to go. I went with my wife and I think the portions along with the heaviness of the of the food definitely could be just bite sized for 4. For 2 people, it would be a struggle to finish a dish.",

The highlight of the meal definitely had to be the salmon tartare (sadly not pictured), the \"constructable\" with the halibut tartare (those of you who love the nori seaweed cracker dish of old, this is it's newest incarnation and it's to die for), and the \"shortstack\" with the smoked duck. I'm pretty sure I cried when I bit into that food. I'm so sad that they took the smoked trout, egg and potato porridge off the menu!! State Bird, please bring it back (and keep these other \"commandables\" on there too) and I promise you I will gorge myself and die happy.  For three people, sharing ~10 dishes and 2 of us ordering drinks, the total was roughly $120-130 (I don't remember exactly; I was sort of in a food coma). Not too shabby!

You will not be disappointed! \u00a0Definitely go with \u00a0a group of 2-4 people and share your dishes. It's extremely fun!  Definitely rated best new restaurant in the country last year for good reason :)",

    "review_text": "I stalked their homepage for months before I finally was able to snag a 9 pm reservation on a weekday. It felt like winning a golden ticket. Reservations are hard to come by, but it's definitely worth trying. I thought this was over-hyped, but it deserves all the accolades. It's one of my new favorite places to eat in SF. I think the ideal party size is 4, that way you can try a variety of dishes.  Loved the dim-sum style of serving the small plates, we ordered almost everything that came around to our table. \u00a0Things that were noteworthy for me were:  Here were my favorites: - Trout - This had mandarin oranges and the fish was tender and melted in your mouth. - Sea Urchin Pancake - \u00a0I don't normally like sea urchin too much, but this was delicious. A savory pancake, well seasoned, and the uni on top was the perfect touch. - CA State Bird - Deep fried anything is good. Slightly small portion, but delicious breading on the quail and fried to perfection. - Pork Rib - Tasted great, good seasoning, not too salty and the meat fell off the bones it was so tender. - Beef salad - So good, I don't normally like red meat, but this was delicious. Was seared just right, super tender, and good flavor. Roasted vegetables were paired perfectly.   Okay:  - Lobster, lentil and pear salad - It was good, but it was $8 for a baby-food sized jar of this salad. - Mushroom &amp; quinoa - Tasted good, but wouldn't get it again. Could probably make it at home. - Oysters - The vinaigrette was a little overpowering on the oyster  We had other dishes but they must have been not-as-memorable. I didn't have anything that I didn't like, though.  The highlight of the night was the dessert. The ice cream sandwich was the clear winner - thin brownie on the outside, vanilla ice cream with candied peanuts, apricot puree and a toasted marshmallow cream. We enjoyed it so much that we ordered a second of these. Definitely a must-have if you come.  The total bill (before tip) for 4 people was $200. Not too bad since we got to try a wide variety of dishes, the quality was excellent and all the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back.",

Although it was fun to watch the sous chefs prep for the evenings dishes during the wait.   LOVED the pancakes (sourdough, sauerkraut, ricotta and pecorino) and trout with mandarin oranges and hazelnut brown butter, mint and cilantro. Must get the trout! Both are on the menu rather than the dim sum dishes. The flavors were unexpected yet the combinations were so spot on and exciting. Sooo good. Still dreaming of the trout.  We also had the duck mousse and almond cakes.. So delicious! The trout mousse and avocado with homemade chips- creamy, salty, deep --wish I could make this for a dinner party. Duck and fontina croquette and quinoa salad were interesting and yummy but not mind blowing.  I was a little disappointed with the garlic bread and burrata and the Vietnamese pork belly salad-- both a little excessive with the balance of salt and fat. The chawanmushi with guanciale was disappointing because I love the delicate egg and mushroom flavor of a traditional chawanmushi and who doesn't love guanciale? But together, you totally lose out on the delicate umami and are overwhelmed with the guanciale and a spicy sauce. Maybe nix the sauce and do a guanciale dust instead?   The portions are a little large for 2 ppl-- if you only want a taste of each plate in order to try more dishes. We were stuffed! Would love to come again with a group of 4 or 6.",

The experience is definitely worth at least one try, especially if you live in San Francisco.   My significant other and I left our name on the waitlist on a Satruday then came back around 9:45PM and were lucky enough to be seated. I've heard a lot about this place, notably as the best restaurant in San Francisco, and I was very excited to try everything. Food is served dim sum style and certain menu items vary. Our dinner for two cost around $170, including food and a couple glasses of wine.  Overall the food was good, some hits and misses, but there were definitely some stellar dishes. My favorite would have to be the Guinea hen dumpling with shiitake mushroom. I really enjoyed the variety of pancakes as well, although the namesake dish (the CA statebird with provision) was only okay for me. I think the tuna or beef tartare were pretty standard tartares for a nice restaurant. Nothing spectacular. However, the most notable part of the restaurant was the unique serving experience and intimate environment.",

    "review_text": "The State Bird is a Quail....!  Yeah right, like you actually knew that before. But I bet we can all agree that the state bird is pretty tasty deep fried served with stewed lemon onions and freshly shaved parmesan. Then there's the sea urchin, ginger, and scallion pancake. Not to mention the chocolate creme fraiche ice cream sandwich.  The concept here is nice, the service is very nice, the names of the dishes sounded inventive and outstandingly nice, and the rest of our food was... well... um... nice. While everything looked visually appealing and delicious, there was just something missing at times. For instance, the kimchi pork belly with tofu &amp; clams (in broth) tasted a bit disjointed. The pork belly did not fit in with the rest and was better eaten separately. The cumin lamb was ordinary and standard. The pork ribs had a bit of sizzle that tickled the tongue, but at that point I was looking for nice things to say.  With the hype and fanfare, I thought everything would be on point. I suppose it's still new and things often grow and change. With the state bird, uni pancake, and ice cream sandwich beckoning for a second trip I'll be back.",

But that's miles better than the \"wait an undetermined amount of time in line for a table\" thing. So, props for the system.  The food was relentlessly inventive and exciting; everything was delicious. The system may be dim sum style, but the cuisine borrows a bit from here and there. (Note: not a negative thing). The concept is actually quite brilliant, you're eating as soon as you sit down. And they've created a restaurant where they're free to continually reinvent their food.  Stuart walked around greeting people with a huge smile, clearly (rightfully) delighted that his creation (obviously the product of a lot of shared hard work) was being received so well.  It's memorable and genuinely worth it. We got out, with tip, ~14 dishes, 2 desserts and 3 glasses of wine for under $140.  Not loud at all for us, seated at the counter.  They're doing it right. They did not create the hype, which some people are now reacting against. The public choose to buy into it. The restaurant just puts out an excellent product and hopes people respond. Personally, I hope they're around for years to come.",

From the dishes that we ordered that were good were the beef tongue cake, sweetbreads, shaking pork dish, trout with mushrooms, and the duck liver mousse. of these, the beef tongue cake, blood sausage bun, and the duck liver mousse were probably the best. \u00a0 Savory and delicious is what I would describe them. The best being the beef tongue and blood sausage.  The misses were the tempura cauliflower, crab yuba, half state bird, fried pork belly, oyster in half shell, duck confit fried rice, mocha pancake dessert, and tres leeches cake. I guess with all the great reviews, you'd expect all the dishes to be great.   The stand out of the misses were the crab yuba and the duck confit fried rice. The crab yuba was mixed with kimchee that was too old. The sourness of the kimchee overwhelmed the taste. Too sour kimchee that was meant for soup.  The duck confit fried rice was just an off tasting dish. My partner tasted it and said that something was off. When I tasted it, my mouth was filled with a sour taste. We let our neighbor try the dish, and she said that there was something off with the dish. Gracefully we sent it back to the kitchen due to the odd taste.  Overall, I think the experience is unique, but the food was not that grand for the hype. Maybe it was an off night..it does happen.

    "review_text": "This is the best restaurant in San Francisco and I'm seriously considering taking a star off every other 5 star review.   We had the Green Beans, Pickled Beets, Duck Liver, Pork Spare Ribs, Quinoa Albacore, Egg Guanciale, Fried Eggplant with Aioli, The State Bird, Burrata, Corn Pancakes, Japanese Cheese Cake and Double Chocolate Pudding.   Ok, here we go:  Green Beans. These were the best I've ever had. I could eat buckets of these. Perfectly crispy and lightly steamed. There was an amazing sauce that I dare not give away. Get this, it's perfect.   Pickled Beets. What can you do with beats. Personally I hate beats but my GF said they were the best prepared she had ever had. Get this, it's perfect.  Duck Liver. This is perfection. If you can handle the texture of liver this one is out of this world good. The tiny little muffins it comes with are great alone too, wow. Get this, it's perfect.  Pork Ribs were so tender they just fall off the bone, not too tender but just perfect with just enough spice added as not to over power the meat, just right. Get this, it's perfect.  Quinoa Albacore. This was so perfect. I'm coming back just for this and will likely have three orders, out of this world. Get this, its perfect and maybe the best thing we had. I say, \"maybe\" because everything was out of this world.  Egg Guanciale. This is perfection. Get this.  Fried Eggplant with Aioli. The Eggplant was pan fried to perfection. Totally amazing. Get this, it's perfect.  The State Bird. We had to try it and you know what, it was wonderful. Just crispy and crunchy enough on the outside while still preserving all the juicy happiness on the inside. Cooked to perfect tender amazement for your taste buds. Get this, it's perfect.  Burrata: This was the last thing we ordered before desert and it was too much food at this point but we couldn't stop. Think about it. What if we were never to come back? We had to try it. The cheese was marvelous and the bread was killer. Think pizza bread stick modified to the point where nothing else matters.   Corn Pancakes: Outstanding! You have got to try these miniature masterpieces. Perfection.   Japanese Cheese Cake: Every now and again you have a food that is so good it redefines the meaning, this was that food. The best Japanese Cheese Cake I've ever had. The tomatoes were perfect. Get this, it's perfect.  Double Chocolate Pudding. I can't even put into words how amazing this was so please just try it. If you think you might like chocolate you will love this more than anything. Get this, it's perfect.  The service was very nice, extremity fast with special request and vary attentive.  TOTAL including nice tip: $145.52  99.999% chance I will return.",

Ingredient combinations that should not work do.   Last night we went got my birthday with a group of 8 so we sat at one of the large tables. The serving style is different with a set menu and everything brought family style. It's a bit overwhelming but we soldiered through the four courses.   The highlights of the appetizers were the trout chip and dip and the poke-style halibut on a black sesame chip. Both seriously addictive. The second round top dish is the duck fried rice. And you can't forget the burrata in garlic bread. Heaven.   We were getting stuffed by round three. This is when my fave state bird, the fried quail appears! \u00a0Yum. Red trout was also delicious. For dessert, the hands down best was the finger ice cream sandwich with lemon verbena chocolate crunch.   The service is great. Even with the crazy popularity, they manage to stay friendly and attentive.   This place is worth the effort and justifies the hype.",

    "review_text": "Ok...so...I would give it 4.5 stars, but I can't (why yelp? WHY?!), so I am rounding down. \u00a0Here's the deal...the place is good...very good. \u00a0Everything we ate was very good to superb. \u00a0However, I feel like I have to round down to balance out some of the ridiculous hype. \u00a0We arrived 1hr 45 minutes before opening and barely made the cut off for an immediate seating (incidentally, I am told if you are between the restaurant entrance and the hat shop, you are \"usually\" safe to get in right away). \u00a0The word \"Provisions\" which was painted in white over the window as shown in some pictures is gone. \u00a0Now, if this was part of a remodel or something temporarily...ok. \u00a0If it was part of some \"lets make it more exclusive seeming, can't find the place, no door no sign\" kind of crap, then it is grade A douchery. \u00a0  The service was super friendly and overall excellent. \u00a0The price was actually very reasonable for what we got, despite initially thinking that we were going to get destroyed just to be full. \u00a0We ordered 2 items from the menu, 1 of each of the pancakes/toasts, and 1 half order of each dessert (4 + the peanut milk), plus about 6 or 7 things from the cart. \u00a0The only thing that was a big let down for me was the $12 (highest price point on the cart) pork belly. \u00a0I wish I had not ordered it, but to be fair, I am not the biggest fan of pork belly to begin with. \u00a0I just hoped it would blow me away, but did not. \u00a0In fact, I left 1 of the 4 pieces ($3 worth!) on the plate. \u00a0I am not going to go into each dish like everyone else already has a dozen times, except for a few highlights. \u00a0The state bird was very very tasty, and the duck fried rice was EXCELLENT. \u00a0  Overall, out the door without tip was $139, with only water to drink. \u00a0Overall, for what we got and the quality of the ingredients, we thought this was pretty fair. \u00a0I mean, its not a cheap place, but I did not feel like it was out of bounds for what we were expecting. \u00a0The bottom line is this though...its good. \u00a0Very good. \u00a0But...so are a ton of other places that are just as good and don't require automated software to snag a reservation at exactly midnight 2 months out like some kind of digital Cinderella, or waiting 2 hours in line to get in at 530pm. \u00a0Way too much hype. \u00a0Would I go back? \u00a0Yes...if I could grab a reservation a day or two out or could walk right in. \u00a0Would I wait 2 hours again? \u00a0No. \u00a0Like I said...overall, 4.5 stars, but rounded down to compensate for the absolutely insane hype.",

Highlights for me were the lightly fried eggplant and the mashed potatoes. \u00a0The mains we had (pork ribs, signature quail) were strong, but I think I enjoyed the novelty of the sampling more. \u00a0Save room for desert too. \u00a0Some real thought went into this place top to bottom.  Two knocks. \u00a0First, the space, which is far too narrow upfront to accommodate the consistant traffic and bar-style seating. Second, the wine list, which on our visit lacked both sub-$40 options and local representation. \u00a0To be fair, I'm touchy about SF restaurants that local source everything from their beef to their butter, but utterly fail to sample from the rich, local viniculture. \u00a0 Harumph!",

Garlic Bread with burrata - sometimes the most simple things are the best 3. Pork Belly with blood orange salad. \u00a0I think the orange salad didn't help the pork belly. \u00a0Good thick cubed of pork belly with just a tad of salt is all you really need. \u00a0Simple.

Actually a light and fun bite, was a nice ender. - Seaweed bruschetta type thing...it was flipping amazing!! - State bird. Very very yummmy  The only thing we didn't LOVE was the blood sausage.

    "review_text": "You can read all the reviews you want, but State Bird is definitely a place to experience for yourself. I've been here twice on two occasions and both times were fun and exciting in their own way. It's hard to describe State Bird since the experience changes each time, but it is definitely a unique dining experience worth having at least once.  How to get in: 1. \u00a0Make a reservation online at midnight two months in advance OR 2. \u00a0Wait in line the day of for a walk-in seat (best bet is to arrive btwn 4-4:30pm for a guarantee seat at the 5:30pm opening)  Our schedule was unpredictable during the holiday season so option 1 was a no-go. We decided to test our luck with option 2 on a Sunday afternoon and arrived at 4pm. The restaurant can be hard to spot if it's your first time here since there is no clear sign out front, but remember the big windows as your clue to stop, gawk, and wait.   We started the line that day and before we knew it, the line was to the corner of the block. There were parties who brought seats to wait and we even got bribed a few hundred for our first spot in line! \u00a0  We got seated at the chef's counter for two and it turns out to be the best seats in the house. We got first dibs to the tapas coming out the open kitchen and were even attended to by the exec and sous chefs. Pretty cool peeps! Def try a half serving of the CA state bird and the quail eggs to start, and find yourself a \"yes man\" for the rest of the night. The bill turned out not too bad for our 2 hours there too!  Anyway, try it out. Sometimes, experiences are just worth having.",

You can imagine my excitement when I was finally able to secure a reservation (two months in advance).  First and foremost, what a fantastic, well-executed concept. American tapas served dim-sum style off carts and trays. A handful of items can be ordered off the menu, but the rest are only available as they come around and change daily. Reservations are required for a table, and they are hard to get. (available 60 days in advance.) There is counter seating available for walk-ins but expect to wait 2-3 hours for a seat. Food dishes were hit or miss, most ranged from good to great for me with a few misses.  Excellent: - Duck liver mousse and almond biscuits - Garlic bread with burrata - Albacore crudo with quinoa - Shrimp, avocado, nori  Good: - CA state bird with provisions - Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - Glazed pork ribs - Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino, ricotta pancake  Pass: - Veal meatballs - Plum jam ice cream sandwich",

    "review_text": "The Bold Italic recently featured a study claiming it's harder to land a reservation at State Bird than to get admitted to Stanford. Does any restaurant, no matter how good, deserve this much hype?  I was lucky enough to have an insomniac friend who happened to be awake at 5am so she could book us a dinner date 3 months in advance.  But I was skeptical at first. Any restaurant that tries to churn out \"East-West fusion cuisine\" for high-end prices leaves me with low expectations. Even more so once I stepped foot inside, and spotted the playful (almost childish) decor. I was definitely expecting something a little more fancy.  But as soon as I started my meal, everything all started to come together and make sense. Cute waiters were carting around little dishes -- just as they would at any real dim sum restaurant -- and you could just order at your leisure. And I have to say that the Asian-inspired (yet still distinctly Western-flavored) dishes were TASTY. Say what you will, but State Bird is incredibly creative and fun. Every bite I took was filled with unique bold flavors and layers of texture.  My friends and I shared the following: - duck liver mousse with almond biscuit  - garlic bread with burrata - tombo tuna-avocado and seaweed cracker (by far one of our faves) - State Bird (we had to! of course it lived up to its name)  OMG and so much more that I can't even find online. Definitely don't skimp on the Chinese-style pancakes -- again, I almost didn't get this as I couldn't imagine it would taste good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've since learned that you can't go wrong with anything here, so order whatever appeals to you.  State Bird is the kind of restaurant that makes you proud to live in San Francisco.

Came here on opening night after the renovations, so I didn't have to go through the entire 2-month reservations waitlist. Due to being some of the people in the front of the line, my friend and I was seated promptly upon opening. During our wait, we were served some hot cider from the kitchen inside. They must have seen us freezing to death waiting outside for their food.  Given the price tag, I was actually quite disappointed in the food. My friend and I sampled something like 10 dishes, and I felt only satisfied with half of the meal. There were only 3 hit dishes for me - the state bird with provisions, the nori cracker with hamachi, and the dumpling with broth (in which case, it was mostly the broth that blew me away). Everything else was either blah or good (uni pancake, sauerkraut pancake, quinoa bowl with goat cheese, octopus and chickpeas in tomato sauce, furikake soft boiled egg atop potatoes, corn biscuit with duck liver, peanut milk shot, chocolate crunch with caramel cream).  Definitely felt that it would have been better bringing another friend or two to split the bill, since it was more fun sampling all the dishes than feeling really full.

Basically the menu has eight items and instead of making them to order they pre make the food and push it around on carts. The best thing we ate was guacamole with shrimp. I am sorry but guacamole with shrimp is hardly James Beard worthy or maybe James Beard awards don't mean what they used to. Do not order dessert as we did and the \"ice cream sandwich\" was more like two hockey pucks stuck together with vanilla ice cream. One plus was the wine list was reasonable.

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions is a tiny restaurant in the Filmore. Ever since it won Bon Apetit's best new restaurant in America, it takes three months to get reservations here. Quite crazy!  The way things work at this restaurant is there's a fixed menu and a rotating menu. You can order things off the fixed menu which has about eight or so dishes. Then the rotating menu is the things on the \"dim sum\" cart that goes around the restaurant. The waitress will tell you what the dish is and how much it costs. All food ordered is marked on the medium dim sum style.   == Food ==  The food here is a hit or miss. There are amazing ones, good, mediocre, and meh.  The tout was really amazing. Totally fresh and really tasty. I don't usually like cooked fish, but this one was so good.   The oyster on a half shell was good. Fresh and tasty also. One slurp and it's all gone.  Steak tartare was good. It's rare beef. My first time having it. Quite different so I can't say much about this except it was pretty good.  Ahi Poki was good. The tuna was really fresh. It tasted like tuna? Can't really say much on this.  Garlic bread with burrata is amazing. If you love cheese, garlic, and bread, this is the dish for you. The gooey cheese is nicely melted in the middle of the spiral garlic bread. The bread is oily with possibly garlic oil and it has a great garlic taste to it.  Ciccioli with rosemary buttermilk cracker was mediocre. It felt like cracker and white tuna.  The state bird provision was really mediocre. I don't see what's the hype about this dish about. It's a panko breaded quail and tastes like one.   The lamb dish from the fixed menu is really meh. Strips of lamb with some greens. There wasn't anything special about this.  == Service ==  Service is good here. The waitress really know her food and can recommend some good things.   == Overall ==  Really hard to get a reservation here. Then just like how dim sum restaurants are, things can really add up in the end. There's some really good things here and some really meh things. Be sure to do some review reading to maximize your experience. There's definitely some really tasty dishes here.",

    "review_text": "Wide awake after a full pot of Blue Bottle coffee, what's there to do but to Yelp my latest review?  Ah... The long awaited State Bird Provision. Like French Laundry, securing a reservation requires lots of persistence. After weeks of trying we were finally able to snatch up an 8 o'clock reservation on a Tuesday.   Dim sum and tapas are nothing new but when the two combine, State Bird is born.   This place is easy to miss. It's small and has zero signage. Not even a street number. You'll need to look for the white door with portholes or look into the window for the open kitchen.   Most of the items were delicious while some are a miss.   Hits: trout mousse with homemade potato chips, boquerones pancake, salmon tartar with roasted quinoa, pork belly and steam egg (can't remember what they call it).   Misses: Steak tartar, fried eggplant, State bird, chocolate mousse and olive oil ice cream sandwich.   Although they don't have hard liquor license, they make it up with great wine and beer selection.   On to the service... Two thumbs up (three if I had them) for our server Ben. He was our menu dictionary. Very knowledgeable and very attentive. He even comped our desserts and coffee all because there was leftover lipstick on my cup.   Is this place worth the wait??? DEFINITELY! We will be back once we are able to secure our next reservation.",

All is fresh and tasty and has a fun surprise element in it. We especially loved the fluke tartare and the trout with kishus and hazelnut.One of the best I have tasted. I am not a fan of quail but here it is done nicely with delicious and light breading. Only small items need improvement, like ricotta pancakes. They had a slight bitter aftertaste as if the cheese was maybe a bit burned on top ? Couldn't figure it out. Otherwise the plate was great. And the dumplings were just \u00a0a bit on the bland side. But again nothing major. For dessert we had earl grey panna cotta which was delicious. Corkage is $ 20., we brought our own wine. We had a very nice dining experience here !",

No. \u00a0The servers were all perky and I felt they were scripted \"You have to try this.\" stuff. \u00a0Really? \u00a0I found it hard to get a smile out of the guy who seemed to be our main server, but the Jake Gyllenhaal lookalike was very personable and we were actually able to get a laugh from him. \u00a0I used to be a server so I know there are bad nights. \u00a0Oh do I know. \u00a0So I forgive the others especially if they are scripted which I think they are. \u00a0No bueno. \u00a0I just did not think this place is worth the hype, especially in San Francisco. \u00a0It is an interesting restaurant that is good to take out-of-towners. \u00a0The acoustics were horrible. \u00a0I had to yell across the table to my dining partner. \u00a0It was decorated like a diner caught in a time warp between the Madmen 50', the cinderblock 60's and a Denny's. \u00a0The bill was around $125.00 without tip for two with 2 drafts and 2 glasses of wine and about 10 small plates including two deserts. \u00a0It was not expensive and it was an interesting experience but there was way too much scripting of the servers. \u00a0I prefer a more original approach such as \"WTF, our specials are, blah, blah, blah.\" It is better than \"Hi. \u00a0I am Bob Marley and is this your first time here?\" Yo baby, can't you see I have my \"Like a Virgin\" dress on?\"....I would go back, but I am not in a hurry.",

However, the staff are clearly well-versed in getting everyone situated for a SBP reservation and handled everything very smoothly. \u00a0Once there, the food did not disappoint. \u00a0Just as food is served dim sum style, the composition of the food itself is clearly a fusion of different cuisines and ingredients. \u00a0My personal favorites were the guinea hen dumpling, the pork belly with plum, steak tartare, tofu and pork cheek (there's a fancier name but I forget it now), and CA state bird with provisions.  The bill was extremely reasonable as well, and with two glasses of wine plus a round of dessert, it came out to be ~$160 for three people (including tax and tip). Definitely a staple on the often crowded and hyped San Francisco food scene, and one I look forward to going back to time and time again (esp. as they source seasonal fruits and vegetables and have rotating menus based on it), even if it does end up being at 11 p.m. :)",

It is, by far, the best meal I've ever had. It's also the most expensive meal I've ever had, but it's just so mind-blowingly amazing I would've gladly paid double.  The pork belly and plum salad, paired with a 1979 bottle of cab (yes, the year's correct), danced along my taste buds like a culinary ballet, melding and meshing to create an earth-shattering mouthgasm like none other.  Oh, the kimchi was also amazing, as was the smoked salmon tartare. To top it all off, the dessert shot tasted like a liquid Reese's pieces.  I took pics, but refrained from posting them. Pictures simply do not do this food justice. It'd be an affront to the food to even entertain the crazy thought that a mere picture could capture the divine essence of these epicurean masterpieces (impeccably presented as they were).  Simply put, you need to experience this for yourself. Whether you book a reservation months in advance, or walk in and brace the four hour wait, I can assure you it's worth every minute of the wait, and every last, solitary cent.

Love the style of this fusion dim sum / tapas restaurant, as so many others have also raved about.  As others have said, it's nearly impossible to get a reservation here, and you have to book months in advance. This is just because it's a small restaurant, and most people who eat here tend to take their time. I'd recommend either putting your name down right when they open and coming back about 3 hours later, or walk in around 9:30pm to try your luck (works best if you go in twos, because they reserve some bar seating for walk-ins).   I've also been to Momofuku M\u00e1 P\u00eache in New York, which tries to do the dim sum style of bringing around small bites in a cart, but the dishes and staff attitude don't even begin to compare.   Pretty much everything is tasty here, which amazes me, because they change up the dishes so often. Some of the best dishes I've had were:  -- sweet corn, garlic chive, &amp; mt. tam cheese pancake (a surprisingly delicious bite of heaven!)  -- hamachi avocado seaweed crostini -- peanut butter ice cream sandwich (or any flavor ice cream sandwich)",

Another review mentions having to wake up at 4 in the morning to make reservations but you don't have to do that! Reservations open at midnight every night so it's not as painful :) Just make sure you do it RIGHT on the second, especially if you're going for a weekend spot, since all decent dinner times fill up ridiculously quickly (I'd say within 45 seconds of midnight or so). I wish I was joking about this!  The outside of the restaurant is pretty unassuming given that this is one of the most up-and-coming restaurants in San Francisco. There wasn't even a number or name out front...I was pretty surprised by this. Thank goodness one of the friends I was with had been here before so we just followed her lead.  We were seated at 7:05. Given that our reservation was for 7 pm, that was pretty on time. \u00a0Here's what we ordered:  ~~Pancakes ordered off the menu~~ *Sweet corn, garlic, chive, Mt. Tam cheese pancake: one of my favorite. When I put thin in my mouth there was an explosion of favor from the combination of the various ingredients that came together really well. The sweetness of the corn in particular came through and added a nice sweet taste to the pancake.  ~~Main dishes ordered off the menu~~ Roasted bone marrow with chanterelles and pink peppercorn: it was my first time eating bone marrow and I can't say I was too impressed. The small mushrooms that came on it were delicous, but overall the dish was too sour and vinegar-y for my tastes. I was really expecting to love this dish so I was disappointed.  *Red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum vinaigrette: we only ordered half an order of this, but I really wish we had gotten more! Not only did this trout taste amazing but it was also super soft and moist. All of us loved this dish.  California state bird provision: the namesake of this restaurant. It was good but not anything that blew my mind. I would order this if it's your first time here, but other than that, it's okay to pass unless you had a better experience with it than I did.  Bacon curry with crispy beef sweetbreads and pickled squash: pretty good dish except I wish it came with some rice or bread on the side to eat the curry with! I thought the beef sweetbreads might suffice for that purpose, but to my surprise they were meatball shaped balls that had consistency and taste closer to meat than bread when you bit into it. The bacon bits were really well flavored and savory, though.  ~~Off the tray/cart~~ King salmon tartare: pretty good dish...it was served over cucumbers and the salmon was pretty fresh. Tasted like any other salmon tartare I've had except for these really crunchy bits that were sprinkled over the salmon.  Oysters: this I wasn't impressed with too much...it was okay, but the sauce they poured over the oysters made it taste saltier than I was expecting  *Chips with a salmon/avocado spread: one of my favorite dishes! You're supposed to mix up the salmon avocado mix before using it as a spread on the potato chips, and the mix was soooo good. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal for me.  Potato croquette with beef tongue pastrami: the beef tongue was pretty good, but the croquettes made this dish for me. I don't know how fried potato with dough can taste so good, but it was delicious!  Smoked duck breast: thought this was pretty tasty, but the duck breast was overly salted  Garlic bread with burrata: it was an okay dish...the garlic bread wasn't as garlic-y as I had been expecting...kinda disappointed in this because I read a lot of yelp reviews that had raved about this dish  *Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: LOVED this dish...I don't know how you can even make mousse with duck liver but it was amazingly tasty. The almond biscuits tasted almost exactly like a sweet cornbread and went really well with the duck liver mousse.  *Trout tail cooked in a soy ginger glaze: I was super pumped to try this, since the other trout dish was so good, and I wasn't disappointed!! This tasted amazing and I really wish it was a bigger piece of meat. We even ate the tail ends because it tasted like some crispy fish chips :)  ~~Desserts~~ *Ha'ogen melon 'ice cream' sandwich, ginger coconut milk, asian pear, shiso: this dessert had a really nice presentation and tasted really good as well! The ice cream wasn't as melon-y as I was expecting, more like vanilla with tiny hints of melon, but it was still really good.  \"World Peace\" peanut muscovado milk: it's essentially really tasty sweet liquid that tastes exactly like peanuts. If you like peanuts then you'd love this!  * means I really really liked this dish  I was surprised how cheap this meal turned out (well \"cheap\" relative to my expectations). All 15 dishes came to $136, and once we added tip, it was about $55/person. Not bad at all for all the delicious food we got to try!!",

State bird honestly is always 5 stars, but this visit felt more like 4 to be honest. At the same time, to be fair, I think it's very dependent on what you order, and maybe we just didn't order a right set of dishes this time. After all, we still try to try as many different dishes as possible between the visits!  Visit date: 06/27/2014, 2 people. Got in line at 4:30 and got a spot for 8:45.  We were so stuffed after this meal that I actually felt pretty uncomfortable, but so worth it!! Pictures attached.  @ flop, would not recommend &amp; good &amp;&amp; very good!  #1 - State bird's take on chawanmushi (steamed egg) - the egg is very smooth, but I thought it was not anything to write home about.  #2 - Chips with guac and smoked trout &amp; - there's always some variant of chips on their \"oyster cart,\" and they all seem to be very good. this one is no different!  #3 - Fried zucchini &amp;&amp; - delish!  #4 - COMMANDABLE - halibut \"constructable\" &amp;&amp; - we are crazy about this dish. this was our favorite last year when they had it with hamachi. really glad to see that they're still making it! yums!  #5 - Liver pate with biscuits @ - their biscuits were pretty good, but the liver pate to me felt mushy and not creamy as it should be :/ kind of unfortunate.  #6 - Beef tartare with rice chip - the rice chip is crazy cuz it's so big and thus it's really fun to eat. the beef tartare was more average though - pretty plain actually.  #7 - COMMANDABLE - Porcini and duck \"fried rice\" &amp;&amp; - OMG this was so good. it's still on their commandable menu and you should get it!! it's their twist on \"fried rice\" - and it does taste vaguely Asian but the real star is the duck that gets mixed in :) and the flavor. omg the flavor balance. it's out of wack.  #8 - PANCAKE- local boquerones (anchovy), yeasted sesame pancake and basil - i think this has actually gone off their pancake menu (replaced by anchovy toast). I think the Sturgeon pancake we got last time was better than this. There just doesn't seem to be as much interplay of flavors with this rendition as the other pancakes we've had here. True to their word, the anchovy wasn't fishy. I actually really like anchovy but I thought theirs were a bit bland of all things to be honest.  #9 - COMMANDABLE - Bone marrow @ - we were actually really disappointed with this bone marrow :( I know that people rave about it but it just wasn't that special :/ there was very little marrow and the taste was overpowered by the peppercorns and the salt flakes that were sprinkled directly on the marrow (the side salt was completely unnecessary as it was already so salty)  #10 Garlic bread with burrata @ - I actually liked this last time, but this one came out really cold and was unfortunately not that yummy :(  #11 Melon granita &amp;&amp; - we had to get 2 desserts because they all sounded so good. and we never looked back :) it seems like for the summer they're always going to have a granita, and so my only advice is to GO FOR IT! the granita was SO refreshing after a big meal.  #12 Ice cream sandwich with figs and glazed strawberry &amp;&amp; - honestly, I have dreams about this dessert. It is SO GOOD I don't know how they do it. My girlfriend and I have been serious about coming here at 10:30 PM or so and just having dessert. We were uncomfortably full at this point (who wouldn't after 11 full dishes between 2 people??), but we still managed to finish the ice cream sandwiches :) I think in the future we may have to get two orders....  Final bill was $140 with tip and tax included - $70 per person, 12 dishes of food, and 2 very happy people (and bursting tummies....)  Do you see why State Bird is so magical? We hope to be back during the winter this year!",

    "review_text": "We had a great meal here. \u00a0From the food to the service - all were great. \u00a0  We got there at 4:30 and waited in line. \u00a0I thought 4:30 would be early enough but there were at least 25-30 people already in line (we were past the door of the hat store). \u00a0When 5:30 rolled around, people were invited in and seated. \u00a0Some had reservations but it seemed that many did not. \u00a0We were probably one of the last groups to be seated at 5:30. \u00a0I think your chances of being seated at 5:30 (and not given a time to come back at) depends on a lot of factors like how many in your party, how many parties of the same size were ahead of you, etc. \u00a0So your mileage may vary.  We sat at the bar (next to the bartender). \u00a0We had a slight view into the kitchen but talking with the bartender was what made it a fun night. \u00a0I, unfortunately, did not get her name, but she was attentive, offered good conversation and had good suggestions.  My favorite passed item (dim sum style) was the guinea hen dumpling in the aromatic broth. \u00a0My favorite item from the menu was the Spicy Cauliflower or the 'World Peace' peanut muscovado milk for dessert. \u00a0  It's not cheap by any means, but it's ok to splurge once in awhile, right?  One final note - there isn't a menu of the passed items and the server will quickly explain the dishes he/she has on the tray/cart. \u00a0Don't overthink it and don't bother trying to catch all the ingredients in the dish. \u00a0Just go with the flow and if it sounds good or interesting, get it.",

    "review_text": "I really don't see what all the hype is about. I was disappointed with about half of the dishes that came out.  Fried pork belly - this was our first course. It was good but it tasted like the kind of pork you could get in China town. For the price we paid, we could've had a whole plateful in China town. Raw oysters - It was ok. They put some kind of light flavorings on it . Seafood medley - this was good too. it was a cold frutti di mare of seafood with some fixins in a bowl. Very refreshing. Fried pork - this had good seasoning and flavor. Liver mousse pate - the mousse was a bit sweet but very flavorful. beef tongue on buckwheat pancake - one of the better dishes that came out. Very savory. State bird with provisions - the fried quail. Tasted like fried chicken. I was hoping they would do something a little more special with it. You fry something up, it tastes all the same.  Dungeness crab with Yuba and kim chee - this tasted off. Maybe they used old, sour Kim chee? I don't know. Flavors didn't mesh well.  Sweet breads in bacon curry curry sauce - I usually love fried sweetbreads but this curry sauce was just awful. Didn't really taste like curry.  Duck maitake fried rice - this was awful. It didn't taste like fried rice at all. It was just a mess. I had just 2 bites. I wanted to send it back.  Fried cauliflower tempura - the tempura batter on this was quite heavy and it was greasy. Really good tempura has a light batter. Didn't care much for it. Lemon curd ice cream sandwich - This was the best dessert on the menu. The ice cream was light, but the sandwich covering was nice and dense. Dos leches cake - Flavoring was off on this. It didn't have that creamy taste. Didn't care for it. Mochi crepe - It had the consistency of really soggy won tons. I didn't care for the texture.  I have to say that I was disappointed with the menu. Though some were good, if half of the stuff coming out was not to my liking, it's a no for me. \u00a0I'm afraid I usually judge a restaurant \"good\" if I want to return. Sadly I don't think I would come back again.  The service was very good though.",

    "review_text": "We got a Saturday night reservation, an amazing feat! \u00a0This is a fun place to eat. \u00a0The small restaurant is filled immediately on opening. \u00a0And soon after being seated, lots of food comes rushing out by cart and on trays. \u00a0You get to see the small plates before being served them which I enjoyed. \u00a0On their looks and verbal descriptions, you pick what you want from the servers. \u00a0My husband called it white man's dim sum.  The food is interesting, tasty and fun. \u00a0 There might be 15 small plates offered by servers on a walk around and then there is a \"Commandable\" menu of 9 larger plates, 3 pancake dishes, and desserts each made just for you in the kitchen upon ordering. \u00a0We enjoyed 9 small plates and 3 \"Commandable\" plates, 1 pancake dish and 1 dessert.  We of course got practically all that walked by though one gal never stopped or even looked at our table as she went by offering them to our neighbors so we missed out on her dishes. \u00a0  It did seem like most things made one trip out and about and then probably not offered again. \u00a0So do not hesitate to pick the dishes you want when you are first offered them.   The food was good, not great but definitely not boring. \u00a0I found the small lobster and lentil cup lacked much lobster and the ahi tuna salad served with potato chips lacked much ahi tuna. \u00a0 But the Dungeness crab and farro dish on the \"Commandable\" menu had great lumps of crab. \u00a0The Mendocino uni pancake too had a good amount of uni and we loved it. \u00a0 There was also a hamachi small plate served on a fried nori that was really good! \u00a0  There was a big hot bread served with a huge spoonful of \u00a0Buratta that should have been good but the fat was pooling on the plate. \u00a0I think the fat was not even from the cheese but from way too much butter on the bread. \u00a0The bread got tough and old immediately on cooling. We only each had a bite, for it definitely looked better than it tasted. \u00a0A large dumpling was served and enjoyed as well as some sort of meatball which my husband especially loved. \u00a0A refreshing small salad with grapefruit was especially interesting with many flavors.   Oh, we had oysters too which were good but not great. \u00a0No oyster liquor left to give that so loved briny sea flavor. \u00a0I felt they may have been opened earlier so not just fresh for us. \u00a0 None of the dishes cost so much that if they were misses, you did not feel abused and misused. \u00a0We also had the duck confit leg, their rendition of \"Peking duck\" from the \"Commandable' menu which was good too. \u00a0Served with thin pancakes which you filled with the duck and cloud ears. \u00a0The State Bird was some kind of tiny fried bird that which was as thrilling as its size.  Our server was a delight. \u00a0We so enjoyed the ice cream sandwich offered on the dessert menu. \u00a0It killed me to leave some, it was that good.   We found we ate for the first hour fast and furiously then spent the second hour relaxing as we picked at our \"Commandable\" menu choices while bemoaning our too full stomachs.  Bill for 2 piggy eaters was about $240 including a bottle of wine plus 2 glasses. \u00a0We may come back!  Update: \u00a0Just got home from Rich Table (the chef's menu with pairing) \u00a0and had to downgrade State Bird by 1 star. \u00a0Rich table was so much better. \u00a0Lots of WOWS \u00a0Our bill was comparable at about \u00a0$280. \u00a0Lots, lots of food and great pours.",

I was visiting San Francisco for a few days and my uncle told me this place was one of the restaurants I had to eat at before leaving. My boyfriend and I waited at 4:30 in the line for the restaurant to open. Because we were only two people and offered to sit at the bar, we were able to get prime seating at 7:30. Once we got there for our reservation, we still had to wait another 30 minutes which was a little annoying but looking back at it, the food was definitely worth the wait.   Our favorite dishes included the pork belly, the CA state bird, the dumplings, oysters, duck and maitake Fried Rice, and duck liver mousse. My suggestion is to order a few things on the menu that you know you want but leave room for the food on the carts too. If it looks good, chances are it is! Also finish up with the ice cream sandwiches and a peanut milk shot!",

Oh the menu options to choose from. \u00a0From duck pancakes to bone marrow there's a wide variety of items to choose from. Plus you don't even have to order from the menu. You can just wait for the servers to come around with plates/carts of goodies. I think we had about 10 of the 17 dishes they offered \"dim-sum style\". You have no idea what they'll be serving so you'll be guessing what could be next (which I find fun!)   Affordable, quality, and complex, intricate ingredients. The menu can vary, but seriously there's really are no bad choices on the menu.  Here is what we tried (literally I would recommend them all). \u00a0  From the Main Menu CA State bird with provisions Duck ham-maitake pecan pancake with cumquat mustard (soooo good) roasted bone marrow with mushrooms &amp; pink peppercorn  From the Dim Sum \"carts\" Duck Croquete Raw Glacier Bay Oysters Guinea Hen Dumpling Griled aspargus artichoke, quinoa &amp; chickpea \"tabouleh\" (my partner raved about this one!)  garlic bread with bur rata ( a must have) wild mushroom farro spezzato steak tartare 'caesar' lettuce cups smoked trout &amp; avocado chip &amp; dip  hamachi-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker (quite delicious I must say) pork belly blood orange salad (MUST MUST MUST!)   They ran out of the pork riblets so that was the only bummer of the night.   For desserts, we had the black sugar-black sesame 'ice cream sandwich, apricot ginger sauce.

    "review_text": "I would describe State Bird Provisions as a new American cuisine with Asian influences served like a dim sum restaurant. I would recommend coming with 4 people and ordering 3-4 dishes per person which would allow everyone to try a little bit of each dish.   The dinning experience at State Bird is very casual, but all the dishes are still innovative and fresh. Everything we had was delicious and executed perfectly. Below are all the dishes we ordered ranked by how much we liked each dish:  1). State Bird - This is a must order. Perfectly fried quail and the breading wasn't too thick. It was on top of some lemon onion sauce that went very well with the bird.   2). Halibut tartare - In terms of presentation, this is probably the prettiest dish we ate. It comes with fried nori which you use to dip in the halibut, avocado, tomatoes, shaved radish, and a black garlic aioli. The fish was incredibly fresh and all the flavors in the dish blended well together.   3). Pork belly and plum salad with Vietnamese style vinaigrette \u00a0- This come with 4 pieces of deep fried pork belly. The vinaigrette was a fish sauce dressing topped with jalapeno, cilantro, and dill. This was a relative simple dish, but the sweet plums was a perfect touch to everything. \u00a0 \u00a0  4). Duck fried rice - yumm rice fried in duck fat. SO GOOD. Enough said.   5). Figs with cheesy cream sauce - The figs were very sweet and tender which went well with the savory cream sauce.   6). Egg custard - My mom used to make this dish for me all the time. It's basically the Chinese steamed egg dish topped with some type of crispy pork bits. The dish was very homey and comforting.   7). Garlic toast with burrata cheese - This is basically like a garlic funnel cake with cheese on top. What's not to like?!  8). Hand made cavatelli with chanterelle mushrooms - The pasta was cooked al dente and the mushrooms gave it a very earthy taste.   9). Corn pancakes - Pancakes the sizes of a half dollar coin with bits of corn in it and cheese on top.   10). Quail eggs  11). Oysters with kohlrabi and chili oil  12). Bone Marrow   13). Bay shrimp louie   Dishes 10-13 were decent, but nothing outstanding compared to the rest and would probably not order them next time I come. Since the menu changes on a daily basis I will definitely be back again. For 4 people we ordered the 13 dishes above, 3 desserts, a bottle of wine ($25 corkage fee) and the bill end up being $65/person (not including tip). For the quality and amount of food you get at that price point, I would definitely recommend State Bird to everyone.",

There is a set menu as we'll as items that are brought around \"dim sum\" style on carts. There was such an amazing vibe in the room - both the guests and the staff. \u00a0And I would be remiss to not mention that there wasn't a member of the waitstaff that I didn't think was incredible.  Okay - food. Let me do my best to remember. Off the standard menu went with the ginger scallion pancake, state bird with provisions, and the Dungeness crab with kimchi. Let me pause here - the crab and kimchee was awesome. I loved everything about it and pretty much licked the bowl. Off the carts ordered duck mousse with almond biscuits, oyster with sesame and Sriracha hoisin type sauce, nori crisp with hamachi, smoked salmon terrine with avocado, \u00a0pork belly with citrus, duck and cheese croquettes, Guinea hen dumpling with lemon oil, and beef tongue. For dessert we had some peppermint tea and the peanut milk.  I can't even stress how much I loved the meal. Need to go again to try different dishes. We were so full we had to start saying no. Best dishes were the crab, dumpling, and nori crisp. I would pass on the pork belly (just a little tired of it I guess).",

It isn't even fine dining, it's that California cool, casual dining with super fresh ingredients blah blah blah. When did family style become a thing? I don't like passing around dishes like I'm at some American Thanksgiving... but I think that is just me.   That being said there were some real knockout dishes: the best dish, surprisingly, was the tomato salad. I don't know what they put in the tomatoes to create a nice crispy texture on the inside but it was so damn good. The first dish, the oyster had a similar thing going on with some crispy stuff to play on textures.   There were some dishes that I can see people from SF going gaga for and people from NY just shrugging at. For example the guacamole mixed with trout. I'm sure it was called avocado something something but it tasted like guacamole with trout and I wasn't blown away. \u00a0  The only other dish I can remember besides desserts was lamb with figs or something and I remember thinking the lamb was cooked well and it was tasty as hell. Not gamey at all and subtle in how refined the dish was.   Finally, standouts were the ice cream sandwich - super delicious, nice meringue-y texture, and the house soda which was fizzy water with cucumber? Mint? Maybe some other greens but it was so good.   I've heard it is impossible to get reservations and I just went along with a party that happened to have reservations. I can't imagine waiting 2 hours in line for that meal though... SBP actually scared me off into passing on my Lazy Bear tickets to a friend because I'm just not the biggest fan of that style of food.   Still, SBP for sure makes honest, tasty food and has super friendly, enthusiastic servers that can make a grouch like me a bit happier. I think it is personal preference and I can understand why people give it a screaming 5 stars.",

    "review_text": "apparently, this is a hard restaurant to get a reservation at.... but they do talk walk-in's if you're lucky enough to come at the right time.   The space is small, so if u have reservations, u still might have to wait, and there is no room in the restaurant for u to stand and wait.  the concept is a bit like dim sum.... lots of small plates to share, some of which come around on a cart, and some you can order off of a menu. \u00a0  HIGHLIGHTS of dinner were the State Bird dish, named after the restaurant. \u00a0it is in fact the State bird of California - the quail.... which i found a little funny that we were actually eating it. but damn, was it DELICIOUS. \u00a0it was crispy fried, and moist. \u00a0get this!!   also, the seafood salsa was amazing. \u00a0bits of fish, scallop, squid, avacado and tomato, all mixed up, and eaten with blue corn chips. \u00a0really, really good!   the eggplant dish was so-so, the shiitake mushroom dumpling was so-so, but the broth it was in was really good, and the pate with corn cakes were meh. \u00a0there were lots more dishes (we almost tried the entire menu), but those were the ones i remembered..... the menu changes frequently!   non-alcoholic drinks i tried were the peach and white balsamic soda (delicious), and the dragon eyes iced tea (okay). \u00a0they also have a selection of wines and beers.   the servers are very helpful, and pretty nice. \u00a0one server in particular was amazing, but i didn't catch his name. \u00a0he's got close shaved hair, and was very nice. \u00a0he even gave us a plate of oysters on him!! \u00a0 great guy!  also, if you tell any server (everybody is your server here....) that you're celebrating a birthday, they bring you a little dessert with a candle. \u00a0no embarrassing singing, just a nice dessert :)",

    "review_text": "Loved my experience here. Dim sum style service...but with American food?!   You can order entrees from their regular menu, and also choose the items that come around in carts and trays. The servers explain the items and ingredients in each dish, and its a pretty fun experience to share the different dishes with your friends.   What sticks out in my memory: -CA state bird with provisions: Fried quail on top of a pickled onion concoction. I think this was my favorite. I like how the pickled onions balance the oiliness of the fried quail. The quail itself was crunchy and moist as a properly fried bird should be.  -Mushroom toast: yum. Lots of mushrooms on top of a crunchy toast.  -Salmon puree: comes served in a cute little jar and you spread it on your toast. (Or something. I forget exactly what components came with what) Anyway, it was good.  -Tuna tartare: Had avocado, other sauces, and a crunchy nori chip to put all that mix on top of. yum.  -Oysters on half shell were fresh and delicious -1/2 dozen quail eggs on iron cast: DELISH. Beautiful runny quail eggs with greens and goodies on top.   The others that weren't that great: -They had a lot of vegetable dishes that came around that looked like it would be fit for my friend's horse. (we stayed away from those)  -Pork belly: not the taste i envisioned. really small cuts of pork and over cooked so it was tough.  -Beef tongue on buckwheat pancakes: wouldn't recommend: The tongue was cooked to the point of melting on your tongue, and with the rough consistency of the buckwheat pancake, you couldn't taste the tongue nor determine what exactly in your mouth was the tongue.  -Beef sweetbread: this one was just weird....  All in all, it was a very fun and delicious experience. Thanks to my friend who made the reservation 2 months ago!",

The pate was amazing and prepared very differently than what I'm used to. I know their signature was the quail and it was pretty good, but I preferred the smaller dishes to the larger ones.    My suggestion is (as you are walking in) to sit on the left side. Those people get served first because the waiters walk in a circle. We were on the right side and got served last. I mean eventually the food made it out to us, but I think it is much more fun to be surprised by the food than to watch other people get to pick what they want first.",

    "review_text": "...cuisine!  With over 660 reviews and 4.5 stars - SBP does not need another dish by dish review describing various uncommon ingredients and exotic sounding preparation methods. So instead I'll just write my take on the place as simply as i can.  First id like to state that hype is almost justified. To clarify - I'll compare it to another highly hyped venue Mission Chinese. The two are different on most aspects, one similarity is the amount, and type of publicity, and accolades they received.   In the case of both the reputation is well earned. \u00a0However SBP epitomizes \"cuisine\" where as MC is the prime example of (best) \"food\" (ever). \u00a0  The awesome thing about SBP is that its relatively cheap considering the awards, the ingredients, the variety, the skill and thought that goes into every tiny dish. But - its not really a place where you can \"Get into a dish\". At SBP you TRY things and move on. Its fun - but if you like quantity as much as quality you may not be as satisfied, unless that is - \u00a0you're looking for quantity of CHOICES.  Finally i'll say that everything was awesome - delicious and interesting ( i was on a mission to find the worst sounding thing on the menu and to find out just how bad (good) it would be - it turned out to be the duck gizzards wrapped in bacon - it was a bit chewy - but otherwise delicious), most memorable was the deep fried quail - most perfect deep fried item i've EVER had.  If you haven't been here yet - you owe it yourself to experience this place at least once.  USEFUL NOTES:  1. There will be a wait, expect 1-2 hours if you have no reservations, we planned for this and just hung out at japantown having drinks and checking out stores; also kabuki theater is an awesome near by place to kill just the right amount of time. 2. If you're anything like me your meal will be 40-60$ without drinks (per person). 3. This is a cool place to visit - not so hungry as the dishes are small and well priced! 4. Service - personable, energetic and knowledgeable. 5. Interior/exterior - well put together space, emphasizes the kitchen - we sat at the bar and felt the heat of the ovens - which i love but its probably not for everyone. 6. Parking - this is a busy neighborhood that's heavily metered - meters do take credit cards. 7. Try the namesake - quail - its one of those ultimate dishes.  Other notes:  1. great place if you want to establish your foodie cred. 2. great place i want to expand your vocabulary of food related words. 3. bad destination for comfort food.",

    "review_text": "For the big #600, it seemed fitting to review \"one of 2012's best new restaurants in America\". \u00a0Fortunately for me though, I actually knew nothing about that before my friend and I stopped in for dinner (does that mean I'm not a true foodie?). \u00a0However, despite not having those huge expectations, I was still hopeful after hearing so many good things about them, and State Bird did not disappoint!  Although it's not a concept unique to them, it's pretty cool how State Bird runs its meal service like a dim sum restaurant. \u00a0In addition to their staples you order off the menu, the workers will also bring around the day's \"provisions\" - about 5-10 dishes that rotate and change on a day-to-day basis. \u00a0Of the ones we tried, the first two below and the dessert are signature dishes, while the rest were part of their daily \"provisions\".  - Green Garlic Toast and Burrata Cheese (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=his4rctu01DufHji4ayNtw#ed50Qtbkk9MB-zU3LI7LWw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) One of the two dishes my friend said we had to get (the State Bird was the other), but I would have got this whether she wanted it or not. \u00a0Lightly fried garlic toast topped with creamy burrata cheese, olive oil and ground black pepper...what's not to like? \u00a0It was so good, I wish she \"made\" me get my own order!  - CA State Bird with Provisions - Breaded and Fried Quail with Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese and Stewed Lemon Onions (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=his4rctu01DufHji4ayNtw#cjzQsSWhAlJ9iabXEAyR4w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) We split a half order so that we could try several other things, but it just wasn't enough. \u00a0Unlike some Yelpers, I didn't think the breading was all that thick, but I agree the quail was missing that mild gaminess to it. \u00a0However, I actually didn't mind since it didn't get in the way of the tasty stewed lemon onion sauce and the MMMMMM...CHEESE! \u00a0Just make sure you get enough to go around.   - Togarashi Oysters \u00a0- Saint Simon Oysters topped with Pickled Corabi, Sesame, and Chili Pepper (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=his4rctu01DufHji4ayNtw#R-IQA20yy9SAJspZ_k_clA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) Really fresh, but it was our least favorite of the night. \u00a0For me, the pickled corabi and chili pepper came off a little strong for the more delicate oysters. \u00a0Still, not a bad dish at all; just that I might look to try something new before getting it again.  - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=his4rctu01DufHji4ayNtw#8CAXIZNSoXft1W0WSUijyQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) It's no foie gras, but I'll gladly take this as a substitute while I hope/wait for the real stuff to return. \u00a0The liver is rich, but it doesn't leave you with that gross feeling inside. \u00a0The almond biscuits though, were amazing - just the right amount of sweet, almond flavor. \u00a0If it's offered, it's a must get if you like duck liver.  - Eggnog Ice Cream Sandwich with Sherry Chocolate Coulis (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=gn3en_uxjtBhwxLEiSV_Hg#cRaxRAB552Abw8x01vEaFg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) Neither of us really had dessert in mind, but my friend really wanted to try this one after she saw another table get it. \u00a0Good call! \u00a0The egg nog flavor was rather mild, and the chocolate was delicious. \u00a0The almonds were great as well, and added some nice texture/crunch.  With such awesome food (and amazing service...the workers were so genuinely nice!), it's no wonder getting a table at State Bird can be tough. \u00a0Reservations are ideal, but they're usually booked up a month or two out. \u00a0Otherwise, they do set aside some tables for walk-ins. \u00a0Just arrive early or late (it's not that big of a place). \u00a0We did the latter and were lucky enough to get a table immediately...at 9:15pm on a random weeknight. \u00a0However you get in though, I'm sure you'll leave pretty happy!",

    "review_text": "For my 100th review this year, I'm going to give a rundown of SBP. We decided to celebrate New Year's Eve a day early and go out for a \"fancy\" meal. The place is casual and we layered up with our coats and hats in preparation of a long wait. We found street parking on the other side of the grocery store. At a little before 4 PM, we were the 10th and 11th people in line! There is no sign marking the place, but it's obvious when you see the line. If you get there early, you can watch them prepping the food in the window.  Doors open at 5:30 PM and those with reservations go in first. Then, whatever seats are left get handed out. If you don't get a seat, they will put your name on a waiting list with approximate time a seat will be available. We sat at the chef's table, which was a lot of fun. Everyone working here is super friendly.  Food is served tapas/dim sum style, in tiny bites. You can also order larger bites. We started with oysters with a bit of chili oil and kohlrabi slaw. I don't like oysters, but I slurped these up. Next were the guinea hen dumplings in preserved lemon broth. A very tasty bite, but the broth made all the difference. You can definitely taste citrus notes. The duck liver mousse with almond cakes was exquisite. Nice blend of sweet and savory. A rabbit confit croquette with melted fontina-style cheese filling came out piping hot. It was only one crunchy bite, but delicious. However, there was a tiny bone in mine that ruined the moment!  One of the highlights was the wild mushroom farro with preserved egg yolk and ricotta in broth. So delicious and creamy, yet delicate at the same time. This one wasn't over-the-top savory, just understated earthy flavors. Fried pork belly with grapes and spicy peppers was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Can't have too much of this stuff, since it's so fatty. Grapes were a thoughtful addition to provide contrast.  We ordered a \"commandable\" pan fried red trout with kishus and hazelnut garum brown butter. Many of these were available in a half-portion. Fish was perfectly cooked to a silky consistency. The skin was lightly crisped. You could smell the aromatics wafting from the melted butter. Toasted hazelnuts were a nice, unexpected twist. Loved it!  When the seafood cart came around, we had a great debate, but ended up getting beets with smoked trout mousse and salmon tartare with cucumber spears topped with quinoa/furikake-like mixture. The beets were superb, quite possibly the most scrumptious thing we've tasted all evening long. They were tender without any dirt-like flavor beets are known for. The mousse was rich and savory, smoky without being overwhelming. Wow. Capers and oil gave it another layer of complexity. Every taste bud was activated with this dish. DH liked how the chefs played with texture as well as flavor. The salmon dish used fresh ingredients, but I would have preferred it without so much crunch.  We were already quite full, but DH insisted on ordering the hamachi crudo on a crispy nori chip. Wow, this one was truly special and looked like a work of art. Who would have thought that radishes would play well with hamachi? The sauces were delicious and the nori chip was crunchy and full of savory goodness. The chef sitting in front of us said it was \"one of their top 5\". Be sure to order one!  Finally, their desserts are also available in half-portions, except for the buckwheat bao. We got the bergamot granita with yogurt tapioca, and honey-coriander syrup. It had some tangerine slices in it. Experience was reminiscent of Asian ice slush desserts, but this was on an entirely different level. I loved the subtle, woodsy herb scents with the sour notes of the citrus. Excellent.  The coffee toffee ice cream sandwich with dates and ginger fudge was also delicious. The crust was slightly chewy, with flavors resembling a snickerdoodle cookie, but much denser. I wished I could eat more than 1 slice. I couldn't identify the other flavors (date or fudge), but I didn't care at that point.  Overall, an excellent place for some new American style dining, and quite affordable for the the quality/uniqueness of the food. Total came up to about $50/head after tax and tips, no booze. Wait time was 1.5 hours. Service was friendly and efficient. Only gripe was that we couldn't try everything! Well...maybe next time.",

Everything is served almost dim sum style as they go around showing off small plates and you choose what you want. Prices vary per item and are posted. They also have a small menu that you can order off of.  The two tapas we did try were good : lamb dumplings and oysters. Dessert always has a special spot and do not skip out on it here. Had the lemon \"ice cream\" sandwiches and the mochi with cloud cream. My mouth waters even as I type, I personally liked the mochi over the sandwiches but to each their own. Definitely will back to try more off the menu/off the carts.   One of the must try places if you're in the city and if your wallet permits.",

I think there were about 4 or 5 parties in front of us (but the restaurant lets in the diners with a reservation first of course)   I love small plates of any kind, and State Bird Provisions was no exception. The vibe is fun and casual, and every bite of food looked and tasted amazing. This restaurant has a short menu of items that are always on the menu, which you have to order from a server. The rest of the items that you can try during your visit are served on the carts, dim sum style. Some of our favorites were the state bird with provisions, ice cream sandwiches, duck liver mousse, uni panna cotta, dumpling...I honestly can't remember anything being less than stellar.   We tried almost everything on the menu that night, and our bill came out to be less than $200 for 4 people. Yes, we didn't stuff our faces, but we certainly did not leave hungry.  I'd definitely be down for coming back.   P.S. If you do end up arriving early to brave the line like me, go to Panda Express across the street if you need to use the bathroom ;)",

I was so excited for this place I even read up why they named the restaurant State Bird Provisions.  Made reservations for 4 at 6pm. Arrived at the restaurant right when they opened and there was a line coming out of the restaurant. After we sat down the waitress told us how the restaurant works, we can order some food off the menu, and some off the carts/trays as they walk around. Similar to that of a dim sum restaurant.  We decided to try as much as we could. We had about 12 dishes off the provisions, 1 item off the pancake menu, and ordered everything off the main courses. I was surprised I actually enjoyed about 90% of the things I ate at here. Everything had rich flavors but at the same time was very oily.   For dessert had the ice cream sandwiches and the \"world peace\" peanut muscovado milk. I enjoyed both desserts and the ice cream sandwiches. The ice cream sandwiches even came with a candle which was a nice plus since it was my birthday.  Overall I thought the food was a little pricey and the portions were pretty small. There are plenty of other nice restaurants I could've eaten at for $250. Even after all that food I wasn't close to being full. Although the food was good, I'm not sure if I would come back as I already tried about 90% of their items already.",

The wait staff is attentive and friendly and will explain the dishes on their carts in detail.   The Menu Items  1. Pancake of sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta- rich, but unremarkable  2. Spicy fried cauliflower salad with bayley hazen blue cheese- really really flavorful and delicious. I could eat this every day.   3. Hearts of palm, avocado, pomelo salad with tahini chili oil- I wish I could make a salad that tasted like this. It was an amazingly balanced and flavorful salad with a great tahini dressing. WOW.   4. State Bird- The caramelized onions over the fried bird were really great. It was flavorful and moist. Plus, it's the signature dish so you must try it!  The Provisions (Dim Sum Items) **Harder to remember because I can't reference a menu  1. Burrata garlic bread- YUM YUM YUM. I love burrata in all forms and this did not disappoint.   2. Oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame- I can be hit or miss on oysters, but the spicy kohlrabi kraut topping was soo good that I wanted to eat several of these. I wish I could have bought a bottle of the topping to eat with crackers. The dashi type flavors were great!  3. Farro spezato salad- I wish I had more insight as to what was in this vegetarian farro salad, but it was just GREAT! This is the problem with eating dim sum; it's hard to recommend what to order.   4. Roasted asparagus with walnut aioli- the aioli was really good. The asparagus were jumbo sized, but I sort of wished they had been smaller.   Desserts (we got a 1/2 order of all of them- don't judge)  1. kiwi granita, yogurt tapioca, dates &amp; kumquats- I loved the granita and my friend loved the tapioca. Probably my least favorite of the desserts.   2. guava tres leches, ch\u00e8vre cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, rhubarb &amp; pistachio- The waiter said this was his favorite. I liked it, but didn't think it was the best tres leches I'd ever had. The guava was a nice touch.   3. warm cornmeal custard, chocolate crumble, mapled apricots &amp; walnuts- I would come back to this restaurant for the sole purpose of eating this dessert. It was rich but balanced and soooo well made. YUM!  4. spiced cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich, black pepper pecans, plum fudge- this was a nice cold bite and the plum fudge was a really unique flavor. I enjoyed it, but might not eat it again.   5. 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shots- literally a shot of PB milk. Yummy, but not super special.",

    "review_text": "HOLY COW. State Bird Provisions is hands down one of the best experiences I've had here in San Francisco. \u00a0The wait, the food, the ambiance, the restaurant - ALL WORTHHH ITT.  Let's start with getting a table. \u00a0We all know it's next to impossible to get a reservation at SBP. \u00a0So, for the desperate triers like myself and Greg, we decided to game it and crash the party by showing up at 7pm and putting our name down on the waiting list. \u00a0Of course, we were met with \"it's going to be awhile\" and of course our response was \"yeah no problem, when is the next available seating?\". \u00a0The last thing we were expecting was, \"9:30pm or 10\". \u00a0Um what? \u00a0We put our name down, and then set off to go watch Lincoln at the Kabuki Theater around the corner. \u00a0As it turns out, this was one of the smartest things we did. \u00a02.5 hours later, we saw the movie, and headed back to SBP. \u00a0When we got back, we had to wait another 20 minutes for our spots at the chefs bar to clear out, and finally, 3 hours later, WE WERE SEATED. \u00a0It should be noted that each time we walked in, we were greeted with one of the people at the restaurants. \u00a0This person made sure we were able to get on the waiting list, made sure we had the drink menu in case we wanted something to drink, and as it turns out, it was Stuart Brioza himself! \u00a0How awesome is that?!  Ok, so, onto the food! \u00a0So right when we sat down, we could see the chefs preparing all of the tiny dishes that were going to go out to the tables. \u00a0One of the BEST things about sitting at the chefs bar is that you get first dibs on what's coming out of the kitchen. \u00a0That means, while the chef is garnishing that savory meatball, you get the first crack at it. \u00a0Not only that, but you get the 411 on what's in a dish, and can request something you like, or reorder your favorite item. \u00a0Here's what we had that night in our order of favorites:  1. California State Bird with Provisions: YES YES YES. \u00a0This is as amazing as its advertised. \u00a0The perfect crust on the bird, an easy dish to share, and topped with some parm and onion jam. \u00a0The only small thing about this was that you have to kind of work for your food, the bird is a little small for a knife and fork, but it's totally worth it.  1a. DESSERT: Candied almond &amp; chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich, apricot meringue. \u00a0This was most definitely a piece of art and not dessert. \u00a0This was absolutely incredible. \u00a0It was as beautiful as it was delicious. A must try item (even if its just for the pics!)  2. Greg's favorite of the night: the veal and sweetbread meatball. \u00a0The meatball itself was HUGE. Greg didn't feel like sharing, but in the small few bites I managed to get in before it was gone, this was delicious!  3. Pan fried guinea hen dumpling with mushroom in a wonderful aromatic broth: This wasn't an item on the menu, so I don't know the specifics of what was in it. \u00a0BUT. long story short, Greg and I loved this so much, we got it again later on in the meal  4. Pork belly with winter citrus: \u00a0This was one of my favorites! \u00a0I LOVE pork belly, and this was crispy and totally savory and when paired with the citrus, made for an absolutely wonderful experience! \u00a0I would have totally gotten this again :)  5. \u00a0Homemade potato chips with avocado, tuna and bell peppers: \u00a0Greg loves potato chips, and with the avocado it was like guacamole meets poke meets picnic.  6. Hamachi avocado seaweed crostini: \u00a0I really enjoyed this, but you have to really like seaweed to enjoy this. \u00a0I really loved the avocado and fish to go with the big nori chip.  7. Olive oil bread with burratta: This was a really whimsical dish, I'm not sure if I loved it, but it was certainly a great idea! \u00a0Definitely worth trying since it was a popover with cheese on it.  8. Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancakes: I'm not saying these aren't good, but relative to everything else, these were just OK. \u00a0They were dollar sized so they were perfect to share. \u00a0I love these, but I'd try another version of these next time.  So, the long story of this, I totally would wait 3 hours again for State Bird. \u00a0And I would want to go with a bigger group so that I could try more things! \u00a0I love here, and I can't stop raving about this to all of my Yelp and non-Yelp friends :) \u00a0Do yourself a favor and head over to SBP!",

    "review_text": "'Sophisticated Dim Sum'  I'm a huge fan of the dim sum model that State Bird Provisions is using. They also have a menu which you can order various small plates from. However, what makes this establishment far beyond a tapas style restaurant is that there is a 'cart' going around where you can pick various dishes from. They simply mark what you pick from the 'carts', and everything is pretty straight forward.  The overall offering at State Bird is really well rounded and makes you feel that have the ability to enjoy an incredibly diverse range of dishes. The pork and faroe with egg was meaty and delicious. We also really enjoyed the tuna crudo, as well as the tomato w/corn and smoked salmon salad. Our only 'issue' and it was really not a complaint by any means was regarding the ribs and the lamb. The lamb could have been a little bit more tender, and the ribs possibly a little less fatty. That being said, they were so well flavored and accompanied by such tasty ingredients that it was really not a big issue for me.   I highly recommend this place for a date or a SMALL group. \u00a0It's a fun and refreshing experience and there is such a variety of small plates that any picky eater can find something to satisfy their pallets. Also, I felt that it was a very reasonably priced business model. Each plate is 6-10$ and 2 people can easily get full on 4 plates.This place is fairly small and cozy, so don't plan on showing up here with a 10 top anytime soon!  PS- 5 STARS FOR THE FRIENDLY STAFF!!. Even the chefs smile and greet you upon entering! Treating guests in such personable fashion and not trying to be some dis-attached 'foody expert' with patrons is something that can be hard to find at times.",

My first attempt of dining here was a weee bit over 150 days ago. \u00a0We tried to do a walk-in but just couldn't wait until 10:30pm to eat dinner. \u00a0And throughout those 150 days, \u00a0I checked their online reservation page but it was always booked. \u00a0Booked booked booked!! \u00a0So finally, my long awaited wish came true via my BFF ( thanks girlfriend!)... I was finally dining at State Bird... the #1 most popular restaurant in the nation. \u00a0And also...my first Michelin Star dining experience to boot.  What a great dining experience it was! \u00a0EXPERIENCE is the key word. \u00a0Everything I tasted was brand new New NEW!!!  I'VE NEVER HAD and ORDERED: ! State Bird Buttermilk quail - signature dish and MUST TRY DISH!!!!!!! \u00a0MUST MUST TRY IT!!! 5 stars ! Grilled beef shank with mushrooms, bok choy, and mixed greens. 4 stars  DISHES THAT CAME OUT OF THE KITCHEN (dim sum style): ! Deep fried seaweed with raw cubed hamachi and tuna with Hershey kissed shaped avocados and fresh slice radishes. 5 stars ! Raw oysters with sausakraut and sarachi sauce. 5 stars ! Rabbit with cheese fried dough balls 4.5 stars ! Lobster with salad - there was an herb flavor that didn't suit my buds. 3 Stars ! Beef tartare with nacho cheese and potatoe chips - who could resist potatoe chips, right?! \u00a0Loved the chips and beef tartare... However, the nacho cheese cheapened the taste for me, it was too much like those big ol' cans of cheese from the ballpark. 3 Stars  The decor was peg board chic with an open kitchen concept. \u00a0It is casual dining with a very expensive price tag. \u00a0We ended up spending $100 for 2 persons and this didn't include any alcoholic beverages. \u00a0My date actually ate noodles before coming out to eat here, it's a good thing he did, otherwise, we could had easily hit $200 bucks here. \u00a0Yowza!!  The service was friendly and impeccable. \u00a0Our waitress came by after our meal was over and asked how we liked it. \u00a0It was fun dining here and trying flavors that were new to us. \u00a0We told her we'd like to come back but reservations are so hard to get. \u00a0She told us that their online reservations opens at 4am and to check at that time. \u00a0I was like, really?! \u00a0And she even let us know that the owner caught others trying to SELL their reservations on Craigslist... That is bananas!! \u00a0High demands can lead to these types of scandalous ideas. \u00a0So funny too!  Anyway, this is off my bucket list now. \u00a0I hope I get to come back again someday...",

    "review_text": "In the beginning, I was attracted to this place solely for it's dim sum cart concept but after my meal here, I would say the food is going to bring me back. It was unique, creative and delicious. There were a few dishes that missed the mark for me but overall it was a great meal.  Kimchi clams w/ pork belly ($8), sourdough pancakes ($6) and the smoked trout w/ creme fraiche are the dishes I would NOT order again. However, the fluke tartare ($6) was amazing and so was the little bite of avocado wrapped with guanciale ($2/bite). The duck neck dumplings ($6), duck salad ($6), garlic bread w/burrata ($8), fried quail ($8/half order), trout with hazelnuts ($9/half order) were all great as well. For dessert, we had the earl gray panna cotta ($4) and the poppyseed profiterole ($4). Both were great. We also had the peanut milk ($2) something I would not order again. It literally tasted like milk and peanuts. I couldn't taste the muscovado. There was just nothing special or unique about it.   Some items required ordering off the menu. I would get rid of the menu and serve everything off the dim sum cart. I think the menu took us away from the unique \"dim sum\" experience.  The staff was nice and service was good. Few dollars here, few dollars there adds up very quickly. It does take many dishes to feel full so the meal doesn't come out cheap but it's fun and well worth it. Our meal came out about $120 for the two of us, no alcohol but including tip.  The menu changes often so I'm looking forward to go back!",

    "review_text": "After spending weeks watching for reservations to appear online to no avail, I decided to try my luck as a walk up. \u00a0I got in line 90 min before they opened on a Sunday and had only one party in front of me. Being this close to the front of the line meant that I had my pick of being directly seated at 5:30 when they opened, or of choosing a time later in the evening to come back. I asked for two people at 7:15. Word to the wise, come here with 4 people (or more) if possible. You will have a better experience if there are more bellies to share the small plates.   For the service: We were at first confused, that it appears you don't have an assigned waiter, but we quickly realized any of the staff coming by with plates was happy to take our orders for drinks or menu items. This struck me as much more efficient. Our orders arrived very quickly and we never felt like we needed to flag anyone down. Since the small plates and cart came around so frequently, we felt showered with attention so I rate service as excellent.   For the drinks: they make their own sodas and I thought the rootbeer was very tasty. The wine list is reasonably priced and contained a good variety. They have a good selection of hot tea and they serve blue bottle French press coffee in regular or decaf.   For the food: we ordered 3 items from the regular menu and tried 6 of the small plates that came around. My favorite thing was the pork belly/grape salad. The pork belly was cooked perfectly to melt and disappear in your mouth without being chewy, yet it was very juicy and flavorful. The pork belly was juicier than the grapes, and the flavors married well. The \"state bird with provisions\" was good enough that I ordered a second serving to go. For the record it was still amazing when eaten the next day, cold and directly from the box. The veggie and fish dishes all had such unique spice blends and had beautiful presentations. The ONLY dish that was even mildly disappointing was the curry lamb/octopus because the octopus was more chewy than typical, and this one minor disappointment was easy to forget since EVERYTHING else was spot on.   For the dessert: we ordered the ice cream sandwich and the grapefruit tapioca plus two shots of peanut milk. Both were wonderful, though, for a dessert the grapefruit tapioca was not very sweet and even slightly bitter. The ginger-fudge sauce on the ice cream sandwich is thick and has a perfect and subtle amount of ginger. The peanut milk shots were fun and unique, but a bit heavy after all that other food. \u00a0The duck liver mousse was served with sweet almond mini-muffins and it is a perfect blend of fatty, sweet and savory.",

Kind of small restaurant for such a popular place. The concept is American food served on a cart, where you eat with yur eyes first.  This is what three of us picked out: fried quail with onions &amp; parmesan, almond biscuits with duck liver mousse, steak tartare with shishito peppers, ginger scallion pancake with sea urchin, tomato, corn &amp; salmon salad, soft cooked egg with tomatoes, padrons &amp; guanciale, guinea hen dumplings, tomato-dashi mushrooms with charred eggplant, Japonaise cheesecake with starwberries &amp; candied tomatoes.

The quail was perfectly fried and the cheese gave it a nice saltiness. The onions at the bottom were amazing too. The duck liver mousse was rich and creamy and paired well with the mini almond biscuits.   Everything else was scrumptious. I was not disappointed at all.

We had:  -Chowan mushi -Beausoleil oysters -Steak tartare with rice chip -Garlic bread with burrata  -Sourdough sauerkraut pancake with ricotta -State bird with provisions (quail) -Chocolate icecream sandwich with cacao -nibs and apricot  Many of the items, like the chowan mushi and the oysters had a very Korean taste to it, and you'd think a Korean herself would welcome this but I don't know if I was all 'bout it. The garlic bread was sadly underwhelming and not very garlicky, in my opinion. \u00a0My favorites were the pancakes with ricotta and the state bird with provisions, but the bird was so very tiny.

    "review_text": "I had a great date last night and State Bird Provisions was central to it. \u00a0I really liked (nearly) everything about it. \u00a0Here's the rundown.  Overall Experience: Excellent. \u00a0I really loved the vibe in this place. \u00a0Simple, a bit rustic with modern touches. \u00a0Not too loud but vibrant. \u00a0The layering of the set menu with the rotational items they bring by your table was a great touch and made the experience unique. \u00a0My only slight nitpick was the service. \u00a0The front of the house was warm and inviting. \u00a0Our waiter was fine. \u00a0Stopped by occasionally but clearly running about, super-busy and not overly welcoming. \u00a0Nothing off-putting though...just OK.  Food: Excellent. \u00a0We had some delightful dumplings in a tasty broth. \u00a0Some pork ribs with spice that was unique and truly excellent. \u00a0We had \"seafood\" salsa which was a mix of guacamole, tomato based sauce and a mixed assortment of salsa. \u00a0It was interesting and good (not my favorite though). \u00a0For desert we have the chocolate and pudding. \u00a0Interesting and pretty good.  Tip: Walk-ins seem to be the way to go here. \u00a0The wait was a couple of hours but we'd walked in at peak time on a Friday night. \u00a0So, here's the trick: put your name on the list..give them your cell #. \u00a0Walk around the corner and grab a drink (and perhaps some small bites if super-hungry) at Fat Angel (a gastropub that never disappoints). \u00a0Then, get the text that your table is ready and you're off! \u00a0I was trying for reservations here but read that walk-ins works...so did that. \u00a0Good move. \u00a0They said that half of their biz is walk-ins.  Now one of my favorite spots in SF (the kind of place you take out-of-towners).",

Really odd miss here given cheesy garlic bread should be easy to make great.   - egg custard: bland and needs a sweet acid.   - sourdough pancake: just not very good. No defined flavors and comes in a very distant third to the other two. Corn pancake is easily the best.   Favorite dish of the night: fig and fondue. Killer. Halibut crudo was a close second for me.   Oh and the service is amazing. The host is very efficient and friendly. Our server was great. Some of the best service I have seen in a while.

That's really all you need to know because as you're standing in line, shivering as the fog rolls in, you will, inevitably, question your sanity and doubt the awesome reputation of State Bird Provisions. Just know that it's worth the wait.   Every few minutes while dining at State Bird is another chance at a culinary excursion. The plates are as delicious as they look. The waiters will happily explain a dish, give their recommendations, and take requests for more. It's quite a hustle and bustle, as waiters push their carts and hawk their wares, but the large space and high, generous skylights make the experience communal and grand. It's exciting, and everyone around you is just as excited as you are!  Give everything that piques your interest a try, and be sure to save room for dessert!",

    "review_text": "The only thing that saved this from a \"one\" star rating was the staff: friendly, committed and apologetic about the rather dismal experience we (four) had at this place.  Let's start with the wait. \u00a0We got there at 8:20 for an 8:30 reservation on a Wednesday night - and weren't seated until 9:10. \u00a0Now, I realize that it's somewhat unfair to hold the restaurant accountable for the bad manners of patrons but isn't it the job of the front of the house to make judgments about turnover and be realistic when confirming reservations? \u00a0Anyway, it set the tone for the evening.  Among the four of us we tried a fairly wide range of dishes and the consensus among us was that, in almost every case, There was either one ingredient too many or an unnecessary complication that robbed the dishes of what could (and should) have been clean, fresh and enjoyable flavors. \u00a0Instead, almost every dish was muddy, confused and/or uninteresting. \u00a0A perfect example was the fried green tomatoes with chipotle aioli: the breading had absorbed a touch too much oil, leaving the dish tasting more of grease than of fruit, and the aioli was bland (!!) - we all agreed the dish was, essentially, tasteless. \u00a0Everyone enjoyed the corn pancakes and the dumplings but with every successive dish the execution was less and less successful: the lamb with cumin was greasy and undersalted; the quail (their signature dish) was overly breaded, underseasoned and, resting on a bed of lemony wilted onions, didn't make any sense; and the steak tartare alternated between too much spice and no spice at all - weird.  As I said, the servers were uniformly enthusiastic and the only knock I have to deliver is the odd progression of the dishes: you are met with a flurry of dim sum/tapas-like small plates, of varying degrees of interest, and then the ordered dishes start coming - and then, for no good reason they stopped and we wound up waiting for our very last dish for an inexplicable 10-15 minutes.  By the time we finished dining it was almost 10:30. \u00a0We waived away desert and heading for the door as quickly as possible. \u00a0None of us will go back.  If you consider this place, go as a two-some - for larger parties, timely seating is a pretty dicey proposition. \u00a0Overall, we were definitely not impressed.",

    "review_text": "I think most of the other reviews already tells you everything you need to know.  But I'll review some of the best things that helped me.  So here goes:  Reservations online are impossible and waiting sucks so you have a few options for same day seating: 1. Hire someone on task rabbit to wait for you (or hire them to stand in line and then \u00a0make a reservation for you later in the day such as a 8pm.) 2. Pay your unemployed friend a six pack and tell him to wait for you. 3. Get there 60 mins or (75 minutes to be safe) before they open and wait for open seating. \u00a0I was #5 inline. \u00a0 It seemed that most people behind me (about 20) also got in.   It's like Chinese Dim Sum but with American food. Yes that's exactly what it is like! 1. Just like Chinese Dim Sum don't get suckered into getting the things that you don't like or doesn't look good.  2. If it's not popular it'll come back to your table much faster than the good stuff. 3. Toward the end of your meal you can request to see the complete menu and possibly order anything you haven't tried. 4. Prices vary greatly from $2 -$14 per dish but don't focus too much on the price, it'll ruin your dinner.  5. Try lots of different items, as many as you can afford or eat. \u00a0(we tried almost all of them) 1/3 awesome 1/3 good/great 1/3 okay/not good I think if we were a little more discerning we would not have ordered the dishes that we thought looked okay, and in fact were just okay/not good. \u00a0But lesson learned, next time we'll be more picky. \u00a0But then again that's part of the fun. Dilemma!  Overall food was great and they had some really interesting items. \u00a0Very creative and mostly delicious. \u00a0And since it's always changing you'll probably never get the same thing twice.   Lastly, the service was great!!! 5 Stars all the way. \u00a0And for a nice restaurant I think that service is very important. \u00a0Why spend all that money for good food only to leave with a bad taste from the service?  So figure out a way to get in, you won't regret it.",

It's understandable but most people don't realize how complicated switching systems can be - especially for popular businesses. I worked in service for Virgin America and the switch over to Sabre was not seamless. Unless someone works in service or tech, they might not understand. Hope they'll give this place another shot because they're missing out!  Continuing...  I tried a variety of things but failed to take pictures of them because I was busy eating and eying everything that passed by. I did manage to take one of the desserts which captured almost one of each; they ran out of one of them (sad face).  They had this reverse xiaolongbao dish - a dumpling in a small bowl in broth - sooo good!  Their nonalcoholic drinks were refreshing. They have a muddled shiso leaf drink that could be compared to a virgin mojito; their guava soda is based on an in-house guava syrup - ask them about it!  The servers were nice and knowledgeable. One of them introduced me to a new French wine that was great on the palette with all my food.   I'll have to come again to see if it's consistently awesome but I had a great time.   Thanks State Bird Provisions for great food and awesome service!  FYI - this place is pretty well lit. Not sure if you care but just saying.   [visited March 2014]",

    "review_text": "On a different site, I wrote this review: \"The food extravaganza aka Haute Dim Sum reminds me of Sleep No More NYC: the Macbeth meets Eyes Wide Shut seductive and tantalizing off-Broadway show that mesmerized live audience, with repeat acts, three times in a night. The carts cycle through at least three times, each time a variety of 15 or so items appear. With a set of stables on the menu and an excellent wine list to boot. A quintessential 2014 San Francisco experience like the Beach Blanket Babylon circa 1974. Is it worth the excruciating one hour wait on your six inch heels? Yes.\"  This was my pre-race meal. The next morning, I got up at 6 and ran my first 50K/31miles with an elevation gain of 5800 feet, at the Coastal 50K in Marin. It was one of the toughest races and quite frankly, I seriously doubt that I could ever do it. (I did, and came in faster than I thought, by a lot). \u00a0Thus, a life pre and post-ultramathroner was divided by this meal. Ordered EVERYTHING that came through the cart. You must do that. No bad things. Everything was great and some were exceptional: heirloom tomatoes, egg custard and the oysters were among my favorites. Then also had the lamb, fried rice, State Bird Provisions and three pancakes from the regular menu. Two desserts to cap it off. Wanted coffee, but knew I had to go to bed before 10. Yes this would be how a cow eats. \u00a0Thankfully the portion was controllable. And I did take a bunch of food home.   Seeing that I'm a woman of many enthusiasms, it's hard to know if I was just being the usual \"OMG this is the best thing ever\" and forget about it in a few months, or if I'd be going back there a lot (LoLinda was one of the restaurants I went to 8 times until I finally got tired). Everything should be in moderation, including moderation.   So yes, this is exceptionally great, possibly one of the best meals I've had in San Francisco. But time will tell. Until that time comes, I'd be coming here, a lot. But Next time, I'll wear more sensible shoes.",

We were anticipating this so ni biggie. They actually called me at 8 and said our table was ready so we strolled over a bit early and were seated promptly. Overall the experience was just fantastic! We ordered 3 items off the menu and then sampled about 10 other provisions as they were passed around the dinning room and explained upon arrival. I could go on and on about each dish but I'll spare you the details.  I will say from some of the reviews people rave about the burrata &amp; the state bird and those dishes were good but literally some of the worst of the evening. Im not saying they were bad at all, they were really good but it goes as a testament as to how good all the other food is. Trualy an amazing and memorable experience. I have no hesitation in recommending this place to every single person I come across.   The service was superb, the food was fantastic and even the Yuzu Shisho mocktail my friend ordered was unreal. I cant wait to go back and try some of the other nightly \"provisions\"",

    "review_text": "14TH MICHELIN STAR EXPERIENCE: BEST VALUE OF ANY ONE MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANT  I've been to several one Michelin Star restaurants. I've never been to a two Michelin Stars restaurant. Before heading to a two Michelin Stars restaurant I wanted to go at least one more one Michelin Star restaurant. (Even if I do go to a 2 Michelin Stars restaurants I will go to a one Michelin Star restaurant if it's worth it.). There are two (2) one Michelin Star restaurants I wanted to try before \"graduating\" to two Michelin Stars: State Bird Provisions or Gary Danko.  Last Thursday I decided to go to State Bird Provisions because last year it won the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. With all the provisions, which are items that are served in a dim sum style-service, provided there are so many items to choose from whether they were from the menu or the provisions. First I had to be strict and picky. Since California's state bird is quail from the menu I ordered the State Bird and the half dozen quail eggs. For the provisions I had a wait and see approach; I didn't want to get the first few items that were served to me. If the items where what I had before then I wouldn't choose them in fear that I might get too full too early. Also each provision item cost an average of $9 if you're not carefully the cost can add up too quickly. The first two provisions that I passed were steak tartare and tuna tartare. I passed them because they were too ordinary. I've had steak tartare in the past however I regret not having the salmon tartare because I never had it before. The other provision I item I regret passing was the grill asparagus Caesar-style. If I was going to eat vegetables the grill asparagus would have been the dish.   The first provision item I ate had Chinese influence - the guinea hen dumpling. It had the texture of a won ton soup. Then the first item from the menu was the State Bird. Though small with its heavily breading it resembled fried chicken. Yet despite a small dish the quail was very favorable. Instead of ordering a whole quail I only ordered half a quail; I regret not ordering the whole quail. The next provision item I ate was beef tongue pastrami, a clever dish of taking beef tongue and cooking it like pastrami. The fried potato was a great compliment for the beef tongue. One of my \"kryptonites\" at restaurants is bread. My third provision item was garlic bread, which was deep fried, topped with burrata. This item is so bad for your heart but tastes so good. I can never see garlic bread in the same matter again. Just like Anthony Bourdain, he and I have the same weakness when it comes to a specific item. My other \"kryptonite\" is pork. The two provision pork dishes I had were ribs glazed in their own juices and pork belly salad. Growing up I was used to ribs glazed with barbecue sauce, but having ribs glazed in its own juices enhances the flavor of the ribs unlike barbecue sauce where it tends to hide the flavor of the ribs. Since I passed on the grill asparagus I felt the pork belly salad would add some vegetable to my dinner. LOL. The remaining provision item I had was almond biscuit with duck mousse. The duck mousse was smooth and rich. It had a texture that was similar to foie gras. The half dozen quail eggs were the final main item from the menu. The texture of the quail eggs was similar to gazpacho. This dish was very refreshing. For dessert I choose between the ice cream bar and CA black and white bao with saffron custard. I choose the latter. Even though it was nice I regret not taking the advice of my server who recommended the ice cream bar.  In the past when I went to ate at 1 Michelin Star restaurant I would have to worry about how much I would spend. There's a Business Insider link (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fcheapest-michelin-starred-restaurants-in-san-francisco-bay-area-2012-5%3Fop%3D1&amp;s=7872d29667bfad025d6d1d5366b5b1b6f7123197529b93a6f955a2ea8c2f2d00\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">businessinsider.com/chea\u2026</a>) that lists affordable one Michelin Star restaurants in the Bay Area. For those restaurants I would order items that would result in a bill that would be under or match the suggested meal price on that link. The problem was that I felt suffocated because I was worrying more about the price instead of the meal. At State Bird Provisions I felt liberated as I didn't have to worry about overpaying because the provisions cost an average of $9. That means you can enjoy your meal without splurging. For nine items I paid $85 a hell of a value. And most of all I was stuffed. Being stuffed at a Michelin Star restaurant for under $100 - priceless.",

    "review_text": "No restaurant has ever brought me closer to tears... because it was so good. On a glorious Saturday in the city, I decided to drag my boyfriend to stand in line @ 4:45 to get into what I thought was a \"hyped up\" restaurant. Boy, was that 45 minutes wait worth every single second. \u00a0While we stood in the cold, the guys inside brought us out some warm, creamy, thick hot chocolate. Once the line started moving, we ended up getting a table at 7:30pm so we walked down the street to kill some time at the Hookah bar. For people without a reservation, I'd highly recommend just going to wait (think about all those times you've waited at other crappy restaurants because they were busy).   7:30 comes and we're seated immediately. First thought: holy crap these people are SO FRIENDLY!!! We got seated at the bar area and the chef in front of us was super nice and helpful. By the end of the night, we know where he's from, where he went to school, what to order, and the history of the restaurant. At that point, it's like dinner and entertainment!   Needless to say, the food lives up to ALL the hype. Favorites were the pork belly and the crab kim chee. The ice cream sandwich dessert was ridiculously amazing, as well as the dessert shots (sort of like a thick milky peanut butter shot). The state bird, which everyone must try, was so incredibly flavorful due to those delicious glazed onions!   At some point about 9 dishes deep, note there were only 2 of us, I realized how full I was. The food was so good, I literally contemplated hanging around until I became hungry again! I needed to make room to try everything, right?   Please, if you live in SF and consider your self a true SF'er, you MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT. You will have no regrets!",

Then comes the fun part. \u00a0Dishes come out in carts or trays, just like dim sum. \u00a0And just like dim sum, they mark the dollar value to the back of your check, and tally the total afterwards.  We picked the halibut tartare and quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli (which, by far, was my favorite dish of the night); the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus; and the braised oxtail in seven-pepper flatbread.  Wash it down with a large strong amber ale (that they have on tap), and we were good to go.  Absolutely fabulous concept and experience. \u00a0I am utterly surprised that this has not been done before, and I can't wait to go back with a larger group to try even more dishes over a bottle of wine!

So we had the following:  kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams duck neck dumplings in sauerju smoked duck fingerling potato salad asparagus with pickled egg gribiche, nuts &amp; seeds 'green garlic bread' with burrata pork fried farro &amp; ramps, red wine braised turnip  and a smoked trout dish which was actually one of my favorites. The first two (kimchi pork belly and duck neck dumplings) were my least favorite. The flavors in the first one didn't really pair well (and the pork was a bit overcooked) and there was anything that stood out about the dumplings except maybe the dough.  The rest, however, was amazing. Really well executed and we had some helpful servers to give us the lowdown on the food.  Looking forward to taking the lady here and some friends for a fun night out.  This is a creative way to serve food and I hope it catches on.",

The couples before us receive the last 7:30 slot, therefore, we got the 8:30 slot. Damn. \u00a0I wanted to dine here for a long time, so I felt that it was justified waiting three hours to eat.   First question that popped into my head, after dining here, was it worth the wait? Nah. Second question would be, was it delicious? It was indeed.  I love the restaurant's concept but hated the stool eating area. My boyfriend and I complained that our back hurt after eating there. I am guessing it's due to the seating arrangement. However, sitting on these damn stools afforded us an awesome view of the kitchen, the very tiny kitchen.   They explained their dining procedures; it is very much like dim sum eating. I love this concept because we were able to taste a vast array of food items without having to order a full order. We did order some menu items, which was the bone marrow, the oat covered sweetbreads, and quail eggs. HOLY MOLY! I enjoyed all three. The sweetbreads were freaking delicious. I never eaten sweetbreads before but I have heard that if prepared well, they are great! They prepared it amazingly and the broth added a nice flavorful touch to the crunch of the meat. The quail egg yolks added such a nice coat of flavor on your tongue. The eggs flavored well with all the ingredients in the dish. Finally, the bone marrow was the best one I have ever eaten. The bone was heavy with marrow and the red peppercorns added such a nice flavor. The mushrooms in the marrow added a meaty texture that married well with the oily meaty marrow.   All the dim sum type things we ordered were okay. I cannot even recall the five items anymore. They were not as remarkable as the meals we ordered. I remember one of them being oysters, I have had better oysters elsewhere. Oh, one thing I do recall is their garlic bread. Get that. That was crunchy, soft, garlicky heaven in my mouth.   The desserts? Get the milk shots. It was like peanut butter milk; it was absolutely refreshing and delicious. We ordered the dark chocolate crepes. That was a nice finish to the evening. It was sweet but not overly sweet. The pistachios, strawberries, crepes, and sauce all worked well together. It had all sorts of textures that were extremely pleasing to taste buds.",

We got to the restaurant several minutes before our reservation time and miraculously got seated right away.  The food is fun, fresh and flavorful, and it's really the experience I think that makes State Bird Provisions so special. The kitchen is open and centralized at the front, and the ambiance is very relaxed but the excitement stems from what dishes will come around on the cart or on the various trays. Order a couple of \"commandables\" = items from the set menu, but as one of the wait staff put it, \"just see what happens\" = play it by ear and order from the cart or trays. During our visit, the cart rolled around with primarily seafood dishes. Also, we found that although there were particular items that we wanted to try that we didn't see on the set menu, it was no prob to order them from any of the wait staff. \u00a0We tried a number dishes but the flavors and textures of the following 3 were the best for me:   ***hamachi-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker  ***CA state bird with provisions ***chocolate mint 'ice cream' sandwich, plum jam, walnuts  Don't forget to save room for dessert!

State Bird Provisions provides a dim sum style service with creative and rotating food. I'm actually surprised that the service model of SBP hasn't been picked up on before, as it seems so.. intuitive.   The layout itself is very interesting, almost like a bakery. You are greeted by the kitchen and a long bar, which is pretty unique (unless you're used to Buca di Beppo.). However, there really isn't anyone to 'greet' you, and there isn't a traditional place for a host. In fact, there seems to be so much bustle, I wasn't quite sure who was my host.   Making your way past the bar is where the small but not too cozy dining space. I suppose the need to keep aisle space clear for a cart of food gives you a bit more personal space than many other SF restaurants offer.   You are encouraged to order a few things from the a la carte menu, and then pick from the dishes that rotate throughout the cart. My friend and I ordered the Chive/Garlic Short Stack and Pullet Eggs in a Castiron pan from the menu, and the rest from rotating carts. I will say that one server in particular took note that I was a vegetarian, and made sure to entice me with particular veggie friendly options, including roasted beets, mini mushrooms and the burrata. One potential negative is that dishes are quite small, and you can often get glazed over for seconds, unless you make a special request.   I don't think there was one dish that was AMAZING, but I have to give the restaurant credit for keeping originality alive.",

Nice balance of flavors and interesting combinations. \u00a0My personal favorites were the albacore tuna, the salmon tartare, the savory pancakes and the verbena lemon ice cream cookies... Really really good. \u00a0   The only disappointing dish was the olive oil chocolate cake. \u00a0 The bill was $60. More than reasonable for the quality of the food and service.

    "review_text": "So, the non-foodie Oldman surprised me again!  He whisked me away to dinner to celebrate my birthday. Again, I wondered if he was stalking Tyler Florence and found a new TF place to try. No! This place is certainly a horse of a different color. Wouldn't shock me if they start serving horse, or unicorn with a side of cosmic muffin in the near future.  The earliest reservation on a Monday night was 9:30pm. Or, take your chances and walk-in and wait. So, he decided to take a chance.  As the taxi dropped us off in front of a very nondescript section of the block, we walked up to a pretty tiny looking place... FULL of people, already chowing down in the dining room, or lined up against the wall, waiting... yearning, longing to get a table. We discovered that the wait would be 45 minutes (for silly chance-taking people).   So, we lined up against the wall and waited. The more we waited the more intrigued I became. You see, waiting for a table puts one in perfect view of all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen. I couldn't take my eyes off the fast-paced, yet loving way all of the tender little morsels were being prepared. And the more I gazed, the more I salivated and the more antsy I became. Then I started to get a little jealous of the couple standing at the 4-\"seater\" counter. Screw it, my inner princess-wanting-a-table gave into the Olman's suggestion and we swooped in on the other two spots to get our grub on!  I tell ya, standing at that little counter is THE way to go. The lucky 4 willing to stand will reap the rewards of attaining the FULL menu. You see, when you choose the dining room, you will receive a smaller menu (don't worry, you may see something that strikes your fancy as it floats by your table, dim-sum style). But, standing at the counter will not only give you the dim-sum option, but you may now put in your request from the FULL menu... damn, I felt like a rock star! And, my mouth felt like an Iron Chef/porn star!  What I dined on. Read it and weep (this was in late April, so I'm sure the menu is totally diff). I'm getting verklempt.   Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - Hey, I saw the word LIVER and visions of not being able to dine on foie gras (legally) come 7/1/12, made me want this even more! I know. My cold heart was only thinking about my stomach. And, it was wonderful. Thank you to the fatty duck. The almond biscuits reminded me more of tender little Madeleine cookies (my favorite- probably kin to a cosmic muffin).  Kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams - served in a mini cast iron pot. Interesting and very tasty combo!  Pancakes! Mendocino sea urchin, ginger scallion pancake, with soy-lime - I have been wanting to try Uni for quite a while now, but I've heard stories of funky uni and I was kind of hesitant yet excited. The nice guy (which I'm going to assume was one of the owners) talked me into it. It was buttah! Like foie gras of the sea, atop a savory pancake, drizzled with the delicious soy-lime holy syrup.  Green garlic bread - just get it. And, just as I was thinking this would be the next item I wanted to request - poof! Magical chef offered it to us. You see, standing up will also give you first dibs on plates headed to the dim-sum cart! And bam! That's how Mary had her little lamb. Well, I'm going to order that lamb dish next time seeing howz I don't really care for lamb, but I'm sure this place will have me going out of my way to silence some with my fork.  I highly recommend. You'll swear you've never had this much fun shoving stuff into your mouth.",

Was taken here for a late birthday dinner, and even though everyone in our three person dinner party was at various degrees of sickness, we were not going to give up our dinner reservation.  New-American tapas served dimsum style, with a few menu-order-only items. It is a very novel concept and I was already intrigued.  We ordered (using the best of my memory): 1. Tuna Quinoa Tartare: excellent, the crunch of the fried quinoa was a great contrast to the fresh and delicate tuna, would order again 2. Fried Eggplant with Aioli and fresh tomatoes: another great dish, perfectly battered fried eggplant, the aioli was a good creamy contrast, and the tomatoes were a nice pop of tartness, would order again 3. Mini-almond muffins with Duck Liver Mousse: I thought the muffins were tasty, but I didn't care too much for the liver mousse, it just tasted like sweet whipped cream to me, I could skip this one next time 4. Fried State Bird (off the menu): My favorite dish of the night, perfectly fried and succulent, served with a broth and thin slices of cheese... sooo good 5. Shittake Mushroom and Duck (?) Dumplings/Ravioli: Tasty, but I didn't think it was a standout; I could do without this one next time too 6. Beef Tartare with Housemade Potato Chips: Superb; we actually thought the chips stole the spotlight of the dish since they were so delicate, thin, crispy, and perfectly salted; the beef tartare went very well... although truthfully the ratio of chips to beef is like 2:1, which though not balanced, we didn't mind so much 7. Kimchee Pork Belly: The pork belly was great, the kimchee portion I didn't think was spicy/picked enough to really be called 'kimchee' and didn't go that well with the pork; still worth it for the pork belly alone though 8. Fried Garlic Bread with Burretta: Eat fast or the cheese will solidify; decadently good; it was like a garlicky-savory donut 9. Whipped potatoes with porchini mushrooms and hazelnuts: Also a standout; the crunch of the hazelnuts wents exceptionally well with the creamy potatoes, and the meaty mushrooms gave some nice heartiness; loved 10. $8 Dessert #1, Sweet Corn Pancake with blueberries, ground pumpkin seed, and cream: recommended by our waitress and super good 11. $8 Dessert #2: Vanilla Tapioca with Peach granita: also recommended, so refreshing for a bunch of sick people, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the best possible way, maybe my 2nd favorite dish of the night  The service and staff was so friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. One of them (the manager?), Emily, who recommended our fabulous desserts and was especially accommodating, was the highlight of an already great meal. I'd give her a 6th star if I could.  I will definitely be back and bring guests to State Bird Provisions for the great food, unique experience, and excellent service.",

    "review_text": "San Francisco dining has coalesced in recent years into a drab monoculture that is an unhappy medium between overpriced American comfort food (thanks, Thomas) and overpriced, oversimple \"French\" country food (thanks, Alice). \u00a0  The invariable Fried Chicken with Escarole and Guanciale for $25, the odious term \"house made\" prefixing every menu item, the Seasonal Disorder that requires us to eat all the same ingredients in their time -- this is religion, not dining.  So I seek to find places that break the mold, if not entirely the orthodoxy. \u00a0State Bird Provisions is one such. \u00a0Their offerings do suffer from some of the city's nervous ticks about eating; witness the inexplicable obsession with overpriced ramps. \u00a0But in general the menu is innovative -- starting of course with the unbelievable, crispy fried State Bird. \u00a0It's far more delicious than the not-so-down-home fried fowl dishes elsewhere.  Please do not miss the fried green garlic bread with burrata or the silky duck liver mousse with almond biscuits; certainly try the eel special if they have it; do not skip the pork-fried farro with a soft egg. \u00a0All of the desserts are great, especially the ice cream sandwich that impressively even outdoes Miette's excellent version.  As if the excellent menu were not enough, State Bird Provisions also has a compelling Tray and Cart service: a bit of a \"Dim Sum\"-style experience without the terrifying spectacle of Chinese ladies wielding kitchen shears.  More impressive than the impeccable cart service is the entryway to the restaurant where the conviviality and sheer beauty of the food come to life. \u00a0Although they have sacrificed some curb appeal in placing the kitchen up front, entering a restaurant and seeing the freshest oysters with pickled kohlrabi being loaded onto carts more than compensates aesthetically.  State Bird Provisions is substantial and necessary in a dining culture that is slouching towards high-end Chain Restaurantdom. \u00a0We need more restaurants like it.",

Instead we get rudely shoved into a line and have to wait while the hostess does other things, talks to other people who jump said line, and then she comes over to us and says \"uh, no, I'm closing out the restaurant with those last people\".   I'm frankly sick and tired of the restaurant scene in San Francisco - it's like you people don't know how to cook your own food. I'm exhausted by the lines, the impossible reservations and the trendytrendytrendy spots. Plow, I'm looking at you as well.   From now on, when I go out I'm going to stick to the no-longer-so-hot but still very solid and innovative restaurants. Like SPQR, where we had dinner.

Bone Marrow: Was really good, but bone marrow tends to be pretty awesome. This wasn't the BEST I've had, but pretty decent.  Salmon (raw) with fried quinoa: was really good. The quinoa added great texture to the dish.   Garlic bread: I had this at LaCocina,and it was pretty good then too. Love that cheese!  Pork things: something fried. Pork. It was soo good. Seriously.   Dumpling/won ton: it was aite, but not really amazing. But the broth was pretty solid.  Chocolate cake thing (dessert): pretty good.  Grapefruit slush thing (dessert): Pretty good.

I really wish all the evenings offerings were listed so I'd know what was coming/available and what to wait for. Without that it's too easy to fill up too fast and regret doing so. We saw things I think we would preferred after it was too late. At least with dimsum you know what's available - here you have no idea. The menu is literally given to you in pieces. \u00a0Yeah, it's definitely a different approach, and that's often very cool. But I would much prefer to know all the options before deciding.  I will try to go again with my BF who's a much bigger eater (doesn't fill up as quickly) in hopes of trying more and finding more things to love. We had five items: loved two, liked two and didn't like one. I don't think that's a great score for a place that so many say is THE BEST and is hard to get into.  Service was fantastic.

You can decide what looks good at get it immediately  - The dishes were creative and tasted good.  All in all, it was a very fun experience.  On the slight downside:   - We had to wait 25 minutes past our reservation time. I do understand that they're busy and popular.  - The attractive looking dishes coming by made us eat a bit more than we would have otherwise... clever idea, that dim sum style service!  - Everything tasted good, but not over-the-top great.

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions has a special place in my heart, and I was so lucky to score seats to such a highly rated restaurant! Reservations are done months in advance, and make the whole seating process a lot quicker. A section of their seating is reserved for walk-ins, and as long as you line up at least an hour before they open (yes, there is already a small line outside by 4:30pm... and they open at 5:30pm), you can get seats. Also, this isn't the place for large groups. I would say parties of 4 at max, maybe even 3 max. I don't think they can merge tables, not with the amount of people inside. Probably would end in a fire hazard or something...  Other than that, the place is pretty spacious, despite a packed house, with servers running around with trays of small dishes, or with the one dim sum cart packed with goodies! The servers come around fairly quickly, and explain everything in the dish, giving you a few moments to decide before moving on.  The quality of the food was phenomenal, and everything was really delicious. Pricing was fairly cheap, considering what you got. Also, State Bird isn't one of those restaurant where you pay exorbitant prices for food the size of your palm on a plate the size of your head. Think dim sum... pretty much the same prices. And for those small plates that cost around $9-10, same price as a dim sum entree you order off the menu.  Where to begin with the food? It's tough, as everything was good!  Provisions -- Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame - Delicious! Fresh! The kraut give a small kick to the ocean flavors of the oysters.  -- Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - Solid! The dumplings were well made, filling, and definitely a good addition to our meal.  -- Corn &amp; quinoa 'tabouleh' - Hands down, the highlight of our dinner (agreed by our entire group)! A really fresh dish, not weighed down by meat, but not underwhelmingly light or lacking. It blew some of our dishes out of the water, in terms of flavor and satisfaction!  -- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - Amazing! One of the few times I've had duck liver mousse, and it was a real treat. One of our first dishes, we were left wanting more after finishing every last bit!  -- Steak tartar with jimmy nardello ranch - Really delicious, although a bit lacking. The entire dish was well put together, but it felt more like filler than flavor.  -- Salmon tartar with pickled turnips - A better choice for tartar over the steak version. Felt lighter, and a solid salmon flavor.  -- Pork belly plum salad - Yummy! The pork belly was cut into cubes before cooking, and they were still really fatty! The pork was really tasty, and the fat intensified the flavors and the savoriness of the dish. It was also great to see plum in a savory dish, rather than toppled on a salad. The plum added an extra layer of flavor and complexity to the dish!  -- Salmon collar - Really tasty! A bit difficult to extract the meat, only because of the odd cut of the salmon. Quality fish, and a good try!  Pancakes -- Sweet corn &amp; mt. tam 'shortstack' - Really delicious! Very dense, and packed with flavor. Served with a corn powder that amplified the flavors. Glad each individual piece was small, so you don't have to force your way through a giant, thick pancake! Little packets of mouth-watering goodness.  Commandable -- Pork spare ribs glased in their own juices - Amazing! For the price, you get quite a bit of pork. The pork isn't too dry or under-seasoned. For three people, it satisfied all of us.  Dessert -- Birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries - Delightful! A great end to an excellent meal! The chocolate crunch was really light, but definitely in good portions. The cloud cream was to die for! We had to call dibs on the last bits, seeing how good the dessert was!  Drinks (SBP Sodas) -- Muddled Herb - Think of a mint mojito, but without the alcohol. Pretty much sums of the flavor of this drink.  -- Strawberry Plum Vinegar - Three ingredients that melded well with each other. I went through this drink so quickly, and really wanted another! Such a good combination, and a wonderful drink to enjoy while eating delicious food.  For the amount of food we ordered, we could have easily paid a lot more than what was on our bill. The food was really enjoyable and quite memorable. Dining at State Bird Provisions is an experience, and it definitely lives up to all the high reviews and the love of all its customers!  I will definitely try to come back the next time I'm in the area!",

Chef Stuart saw me peaking around and greeted me before I got up to the main seating area. \u00a0He was warm and friendly even though obviously very busy. \u00a0We were seated right a way and our server came by to explain how the meal will work. \u00a0As our drinks were getting made, the food started flowing. \u00a0They ALL looked so good we said yes to almost all of them even though there were only three of us. \u00a0Spicy cold tofu salad, yummy, eggplant fries, delicious, but the state bird and savory fried giant ball of dough topped with burrata? \u00a0Nothing like I have ever eaten before and I ate at the French Laundry three night before that. \u00a0We finished with the ice cream sandos and grilled pound cake which were the perfect ending to a very unique and lovely meal. \u00a0I don't think this concept will fly in Vancouver (I can already hear the hmming and hawing and the miserable server holding the tray full of food getting cold, shooting daggers from his/her eyes) but will definitely come back here next time in SF. \u00a0The chef really personified the warmth and genuineness of the place as he actually bothered to turn and thank us with a giant smile as we left. \u00a0One doesn't get that kind of personal touch anywhere anymore.",

The dim sum style of service makes the kitchen less hectic, so the chefs were actually very friendly and chatting with us while they cooked.   Head over at 5 to put your name on the list, then go around the corner to Fat Angel for a few drinks.   Would I make a bot to hack a reservation, though? No. When we left around 9:30 on a Monday, there were actually open seats at the bar.",

    "review_text": "So many great things to say about this place. I'll dive right in.   Reservations are key. I heard the maitre d tell a couple that walk ins were going to be 2 and a half hours later than the current time :O. Also, special shout out to the Maitre D, whom also seems like he doubled as the somm -- seemed to know about every wine we asked him about.   I think it's genius how a New American restaurant offers its choices in dim sum. Only take what you want, until you are full :)   Highlights of the FOOD we had:   - Some sort of smoked puree trout with avocado. Use as dip on chips. Strange, I didn't hear any blenders go off :P  - Garlic brioche... cooked to al dente (can you even describe it like that?) Amazing!  - Steamed egg with bacon and mushrooms. Sounds very plain, but extremely savory! They add some sort of vinaigrette and it REALLY opens up the palette. A day has passed, I just finished dinner, and I am literally salivating right now thinking about it. It comes in a small sake-like glass.   - Cod in gelatin. At first my initial thoughts were \"wtf?\" but it really grows on you. My mom used to make chicken drumsticks marinated in chicken stock, melting off the skin to form a savory, gelatinous material when it cooled. I used to spoon chunks of this gelatin and mix it with my rice, and that is what this gelatin reminded me of. So good!  - The signature State Bird Provision (thanks to my elementary school education, I smugly told my non-California native friend) was extremely tender. Don't even get me started on the glazed, caramel-y onions it came with, I could eat that for days end even if I had to go on a first date with the most attractive lady immediately after.   - Conversely, I thought the quail eggs were 'meh'. I enjoyed it, but no wow factor.   - The lemon curd + brownie ice cream was chewy to food heaven!   - The mochi crepe was also fantastic! REALLY brought out the talents of the New American chefs... imagine... a popular southern diner, making crepes (a diner you'd expect to see on that Diner TV show).... camera crew takes you to the kitchen... BOOM, the head chef is an Asian guy! That's how I envisioned it, at least :P   SERVICE:  Impeccable service, exactly what you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. HECK, I would even 5 star this place on Yelp even without the gestures you'd expect from a starred restaurant -- folding of table napkin coming from a bathroom break, changing of every utensil for the dish, utensil arrangement details, etc.   Everything about this place just left a great feeling. From the beginning, to the end, right down to the check signing. Those pens! The ink gel firmly flowed through from pen to paper so richly, just like their food. As you can tell I vastly enjoyed this place haha.  TL;DR: I want to know where they get their pens.",

I'm sure that passed small plates, dim sum-style, is really good for the bottom line too - it definitely pushes you to eat more than you would normally order when something delicious is right in front of you, and each person at the table can say yes :) But on the flip side it's fun, and we ended up with a reasonable bill and really full bellies.  The only things I didn't love were the artichoke bread salad (we got it late in the meal, and I think it was just too rich at that point, so maybe a timing issue), the asparagus with truffle something, which was okay, but didn't really come together as a dish, and the oyaki dessert which was fairly bland and boring next to the sabayon ice cream sandwiches.",

    "review_text": "What an amazing idea! What a great little place. Ok, if there was a 4.5 stars, I would give it only because of their reservation rules (5 people max) and we actually had to get someone to wait in line for us for 2 hours to get a table and then when we were there at 8pm (our reservation time), they made us wait for 10 minutes. But, that's fine. I will give it 5 stars anyway because the food, service and ambiance more than made up for the hitches up front.   Love the concept of dim sum style tapas. We got so so many things between the four of us. Off the menu, we ordered the outstanding black cod pancakes and quail eggs and the delicious but not extraordinary kimchi noodles and the state bird.   Off the carts, we got many things I probably can't remember but the mushroom porridge, some veggie medley with goat cheese, oysters, rabbit terrine, the fantastic duck moose with almond biscuits, garlic burrata bread, smoked salmon, some quinoa medley. Everything was very very good, some things outstanding. The only disappointing dish was also the most expensive dish ($12) - the pork ribs.   We also got every dessert on the menu and while the almond milk and blood orange granita weren't my favorites, I loved the CA black &amp; white bao and ice cream sandwich the best.   The service was prompt, friendly and very pleasant. Our server even ran 2 blocks after we had left to return my scarf that I left in our booth. Very nice guy!  All in all, great experience. Highly recommended.",

    "review_text": "SBP is a foodie's paradise. I've eaten here twice now and had excellent food both times. A la carte items, as well as western \"dim sum\" rolled around on carts for you to peruse.   The good: This place is really only about the food, and I think of it in terms of a build-your-own tasting menu. Most items priced from $3-20, all are small plates. Beautifully prepared. Lots of healthy, plant-based options. Friendly Staff, and lots of them. A good glass of wine for $8 or $10 is much appreciated in SF where now $12-15 is now charged even for garbage.  The bad: Reservations are nearly impossible, good luck getting a table for two, and walk-ins are highly unlikely with limited seating, we waited over a month the second time. If you're hungry, these morsels are really small, so you will need to order A LOT. Although the restaurant was recently renovated, it basically went from dive bar environment to pegboard walls and particleboard tables. Clean, but very humble materials. If you end up with a table in the back of the restaurant, the dim sum cart often never makes it to your table, or leaves you with the \"sloppy seconds\" others did not select. It's easy to get carried away and rack up the bill. Dinner for 2 with 2 glasses of wine each has run us upwards of $200 both times at the end of the night.   I'm happy to pay good money for an elaborate dinner, but I also expect: Excellent service Professionally dressed, even if casual, staff Beautiful interior design Maybe a tablecloth Finer flatware Not an environment built with the cheapest materials possible.  In summary: I will go back again, but only because the food is THAT GOOD! I prefer most items from the wheeled carts and circulating staff instead of the menu. I don't know if you get what you pay for here, but it's an interesting experience. The decor , service, and environment does NOT match the quality and price of the cuisine.  We've had so many over-the-top dinners at this price point (or less!) that felt more worthy of dressing up for, a real experience of fine dining.",

We came into the meal with sky high expectations thanks to all of the attention State Bird is getting, and we were not disappointed. The food was all amazing!! The restaurant is tiny so now I understand why it is impossible to get a reservation. The vibe is a bit hipster but not over the top.  One negative, we had a late reservation, maybe 930 or so. We showed up a bit early and were told it would be a little while until our reservation. Ok no problem. We told the hostess we are going right next door to the Social Study and we'll be back for our reservation time. We showed up 5 minutes after 930 and we were told that our table was given away because we weren't there on time.....  .........  Pretty poor. So we had another drink and were seated a little after 10. The menu changes often so I won't give the complete rundown but 95% of the things we tasted were amazing. The flavors and concepts are so different that this is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. Try not to overdo it at the beginning of the meal because you will be fighting back the urge to grab 3 of everything that comes by. It actually ends up being a good thing because you don't really have to decide too much, just get everything. It's great to come with a group of people so you can try lots of different things. Dinner wasn't cheap, about 240$ for 3 people and we didn't drink too much. If we can ever score another reservation we'll surely be back. An awesome restaurant.",

State Bird opens around 5:30pm and so a line for walk ins will form outside of this place starting an hour prior to opening. I got here maybe a little before 4:30pm and there were already about 4 people ahead of me and I'm not sure how long they were waiting before I arrived. Quickly after 4:30pm the line got longer and longer and I can see why other yelpers advised to get here early!   State bird holds about 30% of their seating for walk ins which is a good amount. I had to wait a little over an hour but managed to grab one of the first seatings for 4 people. As soon as I got in the line I did text my friends to let them know that had to be at state bird at 5:30pm! Also, if you do wait in the walk in line and want a later time you can reserve a space and time for that day which is reasonable.  Anyways, the experience mimics a dim sum/tapas experience. There is a small menu with items they make on a regular basis. Then there are servers and carts rolling around with other items priced anywhere from $2 to $14. My friends and I were hungry and ambitious and we nearly tried everything!   Everything was delicious and I would recommend the state bird and the corn pancake with the mt. tam cheese on it. Yum! We ordered all the pancakes twice just because they were so bite sized. From the carts, I really enjoyed the pork belly with peaches and the honeydew with burrata salad.   I did like everything but felt that there may have been too many salad dishes that were overpriced. I wanted to see more heartier dishes available to try instead of quinoa and summer squash.  I would definitely come back again and try more of their dishes though!",

    "review_text": "I really can't believe I didn't review State Bird the first time it went. I feel certain my review must have gotten deleted somehow. ANYWAY.....  You can't go wrong here. You just can't. It's dim sum style, so when someone comes by with a tray of something, just take it. It is unlikely you will be disappointed. (Unless you have an allergy, because it kind of is allergy central with all the nuts, shellfish, dairy, etc. In which case, you should probably just skip the whole place altogether.) There is also a really excellent wine and beer selection, and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly and happy to help you choose something that will go with most of what you're likely to get.  TIPS &amp; TRICKS:  1) As far as I understand, there are still potentially some bot problems with getting a reservation online, which is what you have to do if you want an actual table for say 2-4ish people. Reservations are often gone with minutes of being released. Hackers suck.  2) If you have the time to get in line at, say, 4:30, trying for a walk-in spot is not a bad option. This was how my friend &amp; I did it the first time we went and it worked out great. I was working from home that day so I got in line with a book at 4:30. When they opened at 5:30, they started filling up the walk-in tables. By the time I got to the front all the tables were full, so people were put on a wait list for a 7:15 seating. PERFECT! My friend and I had a couple of cocktails at nearby Dosa, and when 7:15 rolled around we were ready to eat. (We still had to wait inside to be seated for ~20 minutes or so. Which....whatever. Not the worst thing that could ever happen.)  3) If you're just two, sit at the bar if you can. You get first access to everything and can ask more questions, and it is kind of awesome.  4) The big table for eight is far &amp; away the way to go. You get to try just about everything on the menu, and it's all pre fixe, so all you really have to do is choose what you're drinking. Step 1: Call or email &amp; see what dates are available. Interacting with an actual person is the only way you can reserve the big table, ergo it is immune to antisocial hackers &amp; bots. Step 2: Pick a date &amp; reserve it. Step 3: Recruit seven of your nearest &amp; dearest who are available on said date &amp; would like to join you. (This will not be difficult.) (I don't recommend getting a group together and THEN trying to pick a date, because people are busy and you may not have a ton of choice in your date. Just make a reservation &amp; see who can come.)  One caveat -- While yes, the food is really good, it is not epically life-changing. So in that sense, I would not let all the insane hype that the place has gotten jack your expectations up into the stratosphere. No restaurant could possibly ever live up to that. But it's certainly tasty, and getting the big table is easy enough that as long as you don't insist on going RIGHT NOW or on one particular date, it's worth it.",

My first visit was a proper sit-down meal with friends of the owners so we got some nice extras from the kitchen and the food and company were fantastic- the crispy duck dumplings in sauerkraut jus were amazeballs as well as the braised pork belly and trumpet mushrooms, but we confirmed State Bird a total win on our second visit when we took a visiting friend there and the food was so delicious that we didn't even notice that we'd been eating fully upright on our feet at the standing bar for 2 hours.   Duck dumplings and state bird sublime again, check. Green garlic bread with burrata, glazed back ribs, seafood salsa, and mandarin aspic with avocado, OMG. Earl Grey panna cotta, sesame crunch with chocolate/orange jam and peanut milk divine. But the rosemary 'ice cream' (semifreddo) sandwich, holy shit.   My mouth was so ecstatic from getting to try so many creative combinations of flavors that I kept involuntarily clapping. Watching the kitchen staff do their thing from the standing bar was really cool too. Totally agree with the reviewer who said that eating here is a great chance to get a wonderful tasting menu at an affordable price. No wonder a crowd was waiting patiently to sit on a rainy Wednesday night- none of us wanted to leave!",

    "review_text": "The best restaurant experience of 2013 so far, and the truly extraordinary experience was had standing up! I dropped by State Bird after several recommendations to try it, but I only had a couple of hours before I had to return to the airport. I showed up at the opening time -- this is key since they don't take many prior reservations -- and the host graciously offered to reserve a standing room spot for me. I can't remember his name, but he was one cool, interesting and engaging guy. I chatted with other guests in line, with the host, with servers, and the kitchen staff while waiting. It was just that kind of warm, friendly and low key place -- quite amazing considering the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen and the Bon Appetit ranking as the Best New Restaurant in America in 2012. Better yet, each item costs less than $10, and one can have a filling experience for $50 without wine with no problem, and even less for just a couple of tapas.  The servings are served dim sum style, and my samplings involved dishes that ranged from the more gamey balls of rabbit meat and cheese, to the Asian fusion flavors in the Thai Pork Belly Salad, and to southern comfort style fried quail (the state bird of California). Though I certainly love fried chicken, I think I would probably skip the quail next time in favor of other options. The Thai salad was my favorite. I violated my no sugar rule and made an exception for the ice cream sandwich with chicory ice cream and coconut caramel. Amazing, and enough for 2-3 diners.  The food was excellent, but I will have to admit that it was the atmosphere and vibe created by the engagement of the staff that made State Bird Provisions a memorable experience.",

    "review_text": "I'm a bit torn about this place. \u00a0Went in, knowing about all the hype and having read the articles about it being the best new restaurant in 2012, etc, etc.. so it was pretty hyped up. \u00a0Went in.. the space was nice... kitchen WIDE open and in the front. \u00a0A counter at the front for 3 people to stand and eat, then about 9 more bar spots to sit and eat and watch them cook. \u00a0Everyone waits along the wall by the kitchen... and the seating area is in the back.. looks like no tables more than 4 people. \u00a0It's an interesting and cool concept. \u00a0You order off a limited menu and then they also come by with trays and carts (kinda dim-sum style) with special dishes of the day. \u00a0There is a price clearly showing how much each is, which I think is nice. \u00a0Everything is meant to be shared. \u00a0It's an interesting way to eat... there is food, you just eat and share... no order to anything... no courses... kind of like a tasting or a cocktail hour with horderves. \u00a0Some notes:  1. The service was great. \u00a0We were greeted warmly. \u00a0Our server asked us if we'd been there before and explained everything well. \u00a0The people who came by w/ the trays/cart described their dishes well. \u00a0Our plates got switched out when we wanted, etc etc. 2. It's not pretentious at all. \u00a0It has more of a neighborhood, casual feel.... kinda hipsterish. 3. The price wasn't bad. \u00a0We got a LOT of dishes, including 4 big $16-20 ones off the main menu. \u00a0The smaller plates they come by with are small and cheap.. they range from $6-10. \u00a0Include a bottle a wine and it was $65 a person w/ generous tip. 4. \u00a0The smaller dishes, you wonder how are four people going to share this (one meatball?). \u00a0but it's actually no problem. 5. \u00a0They bring out the trays and carts at random, so they brought out stuff at the end I wanted to try but we were already full and done eating...  The food itself? \u00a0It was interesting and unique. \u00a0It was good but not awesome. \u00a0Nothing wowed, nothing popped, the flavors were kind of muted if anything. \u00a0The state bird (fried quail), the duck, the beef salad were all pretty good; the ribs were weird.. not really glazed or sauced like you would think.. tender, but not super tender; the pancake with smoked sturgeon was awesome; the garlic bread with burrata was good texture, but no flavor; the sweetbread meatball was ok; the spicy kimchi yuba with smoked egg 'bottarga' was interesting in a good way... a bit oily but it did have a good kimchi flavor; the vegetable romesco was so-so... the swordfish and artichoke was so-so... I didn't like the ice cream sandwich... \u00a0we got a few more dishes I think, but I can't remember... overall, it was just muted flavors.  Given the opportunity I'd go back. \u00a0try some other stuff.",

Like everyone else mentioned this is dim sum style and delishectable [my new word].  Get the quail, get the tuna, get anything they present to you that seems appetizing [and skip the ones that don't catch your fancy, they have a sizable selection so there's always other stuff to try].  5 people and two rounds of drinks came out to a bit over $300.  We're going again this month, not because I did anything to deserve it but because I am terrible at saving money.  Also, seemingly best table is the far back right which is right next to the kitchen so we got everything the second the waiter stepped out onto the floor.",

Returned after beers and snacks at nearby Japantown establishment. Seated immediately at the chef's counter with a great view into the kitchen. Love that. Service was, over all, attentive considering the packed house and full waiting area nearby. I won't go into the dishes since so many Yelpers have done that. What I like about SBP is the experimental feel to every dish. Since they cost between $8 and $15 for a a sharable plate, it's not as though you're out a lot of money if any one of them just doesn't work out well. And that described three or four of the 12 or so dishes we enjoyed. Nothing was bad and some were outstanding. SBP is a cool concept. I'll be back and soon.",

    "review_text": "Maybe one of the best openings in 2011. Of course they waited until NYE. We got one of the larger tables in the back on opening night and they didn't disappoint. While most people were out doing fancy cut throat NYE \"special menus\", we opted for the reputation of two chefs coming back into the game. Turns out the ex Rubicon gang came back with many of their past co workers so the night started off with a staff that mostly knew each other in some way or another.   The long corridor with the reception at the front of the kitchen line was not something I expected. I knew where the place was but still did a double take. The combination of industrial space, cafe, and dim sum style service makes for an interesting mix. Things come out on trays in carts, etc, etc. Being the gluttons we are, we had two (yes 2) of everything that was offered:  crudit\u00e9 with goat cheese &amp; toasted sesame tofu with lime, ginger &amp; fennel pickled wild mushrooms with root purees &amp; hazelnuts chicken 'salad' with buddha's hand &amp; celery root curd sourdough kraut ricotta &amp; pecorino pancakes 'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravy carnitas stuffed squid rye bread &amp; red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish-ale cream smokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurt fried quail with lemon stewed onions fragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey &amp; pomegranate roasted carrots &amp; braised jammy greens meyer lemon chocolate croquettes with blue bottle coffee sabayon milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jam drunken cherry caramel chocolate mistake chestnut buckwheat profiterole peanut muscovado milk warm fig cinnamon swirls  How's that for a spread? I think we put some fear in the line and front of house as we just tore stuff down non stop. The bonus? everything was delicious and intriguing. The flavor and ingredient combinations are thought provoking while tasty. I think the Fillmore area just got a huge boost and I know where my de facto before shows around the area is now. StatebirdSF certainly ended the year with a bang!",

    "review_text": "On a mission to start trying the hip, hyped restaurants of the moment. \u00a0SBP seemed like a good place to start. Ended up with Wednesday 9:30 pm rez. Arrived early but were seated pretty much at 9:30. There is nowhere to sit if you are waiting for a table. We stood against the wall with 6 other people. \u00a0The guy at the front getting drinks was very nice. \u00a0He had me try 3 different wines to find one I liked.  Once seated, I was alread starving, and so \u00a0grabbed the first thing that came around- duck neck dumplings with a sauerjus(?) sauce. It was tasty. The sauce was odd. Definitely sour. Interesting combo, but one that I'm not sure worked for me. \u00a0I was so hungry I hardly tasted the dumpling. 2 per order. I tried more sauce on its own. Kind of like creamy sauerkraut juice soup. I liked it but there was so much sauce/broth in the bowl, it seemed like a waste, since there was no bread or anything else with which to eat it.  My friend got tuna tartare with quinoa and bonita flakes. Odd. But she said the more she ate, the more it grew on her. \u00a0The combination of textures was interesting. Crunchy, soft, chewy. \u00a0To me the prevalent flavor was the bonito flakes.  Next up was the shaved veg salad with a sort of ceviche salsa. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=RQIX6ZO0PXKAkNJtEYJQ7g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>. \u00a0The rock shrimp in the salsa were fantastic. But I wanted more of the seafood! The shaved veggies were baby root vegs with the greens attached. I was a little confused- I don't usually eat carrot tops. In fact, I've read they can be poisonous. But I ate them. Mostly tasted the salsa. It was good, but I sure would have loved a bowl of the seafood salsa.  I was very excited about the kimchi/porkbelly/clam/tofu stew. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?userid=QHuytIVZEQvVxL209Hl4tA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>. It sounded great! But I was not thrilled with it. \u00a0Why? Because I didn't consider that it would be spicy, and having never had pork belly before, I was surprised at how little I like it. Why is pork belly so popular?! It's basically like the chunks of fat on pork chops that I avoid. Not the food's fault, just not my thing. \u00a0It looked great, though.  My favorite dishes were the green garlic bread with burrata and the sourdough pecorino \"pancakes\" (tiny, blini size things) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=_SRuA2rz5UjaURZ1yAXORQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>. Both were tasty, carby and cheesy. I'd like a giant version of the pancakes. And maybe a garlic bread thing to myself.   Dessert - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=lrGxQb9i4hZDgxTGRPAEEQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>. \u00a0Neither of us could understand the rave reviews about the peanut milk. \u00a0A tiny glass of peanut flavored milk. You know, there's a place on Divisadero near Haight that has had a sign for their homemade peanut milk for longer than I can remember. Perhaps that's where I've tried it before. \u00a0I've had it somewhere. The peace milk struck me as completely unspectacular. What is the big deal?! The tastiest was the coconut/custard thing with candied hazelnuts. Oh yeah! I would have liked a bigger piece! Milk Chocolate sesame crunch with citrus struck me as much darker than milk chocolate. It was tasty, but too dark for my taste.  My unrefined palate says- interesting mix of food, many little tastes, but perhaps combinations with which I wasn't blown away.  All that said, the presentation was fantastic. Really nice looking dishes. The service was also great. We both couldn't get over how friendly everyone was. Like they took happy pills. Nicely un-San Francisco. And I was surprised at how full I got from what did not appear to be a large quantity of food.  FYI- I asked before going if the 9:30 rez would mean getting a reduced selection of the dim sum style food and was told it would not. But the food carts began to dwindle about 15 minutes after we were seated. I asked and they said they were slowing down for the evening. They did say we could order anything from the passing menu if we wanted, but admittedly, I was already kind of full by then.   I'd definitely go again, but would go less hungry so I could be more discriminating in what I choose and more aware of the flavors of what I was eating.",

Not every dish wow'ed. We started off with a couple of dishes that were \"meh\" and the meal progressively got better as we dined.

They have people pushing around carts with the food on them and a little price tag attached, very cute. They also have a menu you can order from (i.e. savory pancakes, meats). Boyfriend and I ordered 2 mains from the menu and around 13 dimsum dishes for a total of ~$150, and were stuffed by the end. SBP says the menu changes frequently, but both the main menu and daily dimsum items look more or less the same to me.  Food (4/5) The food was very up and down--there were a few dishes that we did not care for at all BUT there was one dish that made the entire meal worth it--the hamachi nori chip. It is literally to die for. It's a thick, crispy nori chip with small pieces of hamachi sashimi sitting on top with dabs of avocado, black garlic aioli, and radishes. Literally one of the best dishes I have had in awhile. But that being said, the rest of the dishes were only okay. We did not care for the duck pancake, cumin lamb, duck liver mousse/almond biscuits, or the garlic bread at all. We did like the lobster salad, yogurt caviar, oysters, guinea hen dumplings, and the state bird a lot. The dessert was just okay.  Ambience (5/5) Love the vibes here. Very trendy and lax. We had a really fun time dining here.  Service (5/5) The people here are so so nice. The table that we were supposed to be waiting for took forever. The hostess kept apologizing profusely and did everything she could to make our wait more bearable--she eventually worked some magic to help us get another table. She was a sweetheart!  ONLY COMPLAINT: The reservation system! Literally impossible to get a reservation (opens online at 4am daily and gets booked within seconds) but the good news is there is always a good chunk of tables saved for walk-in. But the line does start forming early, so definitely get there by 4:30pm (they open at 5:30pm). If you are in line before the hat shop door...chances are you will get in on the first seating. If you don't get in on the first seating though, they will take your name down and give you a time to return (usually around 7:00pm). They also bring you treats while you wait in line outside!  Overall, will definitely be back because it's a great dining experience and the hamachi nori chip is amazing.",

There were two exceptional dishes, most were excellent, and a couple were just average. \u00a0If you see the smoked trout quinoa, get it right away. \u00a0Don't wait for the server, pick it up and put one, two, maybe three servings of it on your table. \u00a0  The dishes and dining experience were definitely fun and creative. \u00a0I will definitely be back again.",

I have no idea how they do it, but it looks like salmon with a delicious crunchy salty skin. Bread with Burrata also can't miss.

    "review_text": "This past Saturday, we lucked into a friend of a friend giving away their 7pm reservation for State Bird. We snapped up the reservation without hesitation, and man am I glad we did. As far as SF eateries go, this experience is easily in my all-time top three.  Our waiter recommended ordering at least three items off the menu and filling in the rest of the meal with dim sum... an approach that I highly recommend. Everything was delicious and memorable, but my highlights were the pork belly with pluots (two of my favorite foods, magically meeting in one exquisite dish), the guinea hen dumpling, and the hearts of palm salad.  As for the non-food elements, the waiters and waitresses worked as a cohesive unit and were all knowledgeable and quirky. The decor was understated on the exterior (which made it a little difficult to locate), and was charmingly modest and unique on the interior.   It's refreshing when a place lives up to the culinary hype without being pretentious. State Bird, you make the Quail proud.",

A fun place for a group to come and partake in an interactive dining experience. The advantage of the dim sum, tapas style is that instead of only tasting a couple dishes off an a la carte menu you get to try 10 or so dishes of smaller portions! Although I think my stomach would have allowed me to try 15 or 20 dishes but my wallet not so much. For that price I would rather do a tasting menu elsewhere.  Highlights (5 star dishes) included the Buratta, Fried Eggplant, Marinated Tofu, and Pudding Pretty solid dishes (3.5-4 star) were the pancake, quail (although overpriced at $16), and cumin lamb (not as tender and seasoned as I hoped), and ice cream sandwich  Word is bon (appetit)",

Our waitress was pleasant and very helpful in answering some of our questions about the menu. We ended up having:  1. CA STATE BIRD WITH PROVISIONS  This is a whole deep-fried bone-in quail. The provisions were lemon-stewed onions with shaved Parmesan. The bird was quite moist and delicious. It is a bit difficult to share as the bird is not deboned - you'll have to split it with some creative cutting. Best to eat with your hands to get all the delicious meat off the bones.  2. MARINATED WILD MUSHROOMS w/ vanilla-parsnip pur\u00e9e &amp; hazelnuts The mushrooms were extremely flavorful and had just the right amount of tang. The hazelnuts gave the dish the right amount of sweetness and a nice crunchy texture combined with the soft mushrooms.  I also had a glass of Temperanillo, which was very good.   I enjoyed the ambience of SBP as it was equal parts rustic and modern. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend SBP for some quick bites as one of a few stops on a night out in the Fillmore neighborhood. Probably not great for a filling dinner but certainly a cozy, low-key date night nibble.",

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions is one of those places you just have to try at least once.  It's american food, it's tapas style, it's served in carts rolled by the different waiters and waitresses that try to sell you the item.  Each item has a price, and you get a card with different prices on it, and each time you pick something from the cart, they put a tally next to the price.  There are a couple of mains and dessert that are made to order, I guess because this would probably not taste that good if it was carted around and cold or melted.  I took pictures of the whole thing, I'll have to post some photos soon. \u00a0I really enjoyed it and I highly recommend that you try it once.  This is the problem with not writing a review immediately after eating. \u00a0It's so hard to remember what you ate. \u00a0But the important part is that if the restaurant was so good that it #1 compels you to write something #2 you just have an overall great feeling of when you were there.  So go if you can get a reservation. If you can't, my suggestion is go early, like around 4 or 5, usually the first 10 people can snag a seat. \u00a0( provided that you're not an asshole that brings 10 friends with you to a small, cozy, chill restaurant like this)",

    "review_text": "I usually don't hit up restaurants this classy but I decided to jump out of my comfort zone a little with this pick. Knowing that I won't be coming back here for a long, long time, I went all out with ordering. And, I gotta say that State Bird truly delivers on both taste and texture in their dishes. Speaking of, this is my breakdown for each dish I tasted:  - Smoked trout. Nice creamy puree with bite-size chunks of pickled beets, capers and onions. I liked it but it tasted a bit average for this quality of a restaurant.   - State bird w/ provisions. Great buttermilk crust with cheese and onions. Quail was so tender and juicy also, a difficult technical feat, I know. The little bit of citrus gave it a nice kick, too. Not my favorite dish, though. I enjoyed but wasn't blown away by it.  - Uni pancake. It really blew away my previous conceptions of uni. To me, it had always been soggy and grainy. This pancake topped with uni was at the same time crispy yet creamy. That uni was fresh, my friends. Sadly, the pancake itself was too small to warrant the 14 dollar price tag, IMO.   - Steak tartare. Definitely an above average steak tartare. Bright and light on top of lettuce cups with some nice aioli on the side. The only thing that distracted me from the flavor were the croutons. I felt they were unnecessary and tough. I understand the need for a balance in texture but I felt the lettuce and toppings were more than enough to cover that.  - Salmon tartare. Disappointing. My least favorite. This dish tasted like I could have made it. Fresh and tasty but not too inventive.  - Guinea Hen Dumpling. A decent dumpling but I can't understand why the guinea hen made any difference in the filling. I thought the skin and the broth made more sense.  - Garlic bread with burrata. Oh man, definitely my favorite savory dish here. I literally wanted to get another one just so I could eat it all by myself. The melted cheese on top of great bread, oh good god. It was like eating my dreams.  - Pork belly. Awesome belly meat with super delicious broth. The grapes really tied the dish together, though, giving it that extra level of class. My second favorite savory dish.  - Ice cream sandwich. We got the coffee toffee. Best decision in my life. This is hands down the best dish of the night and possibly the best ice cream sandwich I will ever eat. The ice cream was light but not watery with just the right amount of creamy. The sandwich was soft yet didn't fall apart. The ginger fudge, the toffee and the dates? Perfect toppings to an already great sandwich. I seriously cannot get enough of it and am so sad that the night is over. Otherwise? I'd probably go broke ordering more of these.  Major drawbacks of the night: Waited a long time for my table to be prepared but the service when we sat down was great and we got to try some complimentary wine/rabbit meatball (which incidentally was also amazingly tender and juicy) in the meantime. The small waiting area was a little cramped as well, which is not to say the entire area is cramped. The actual space was quite nice and cozy. Overall, I definitely hope to come back here someday and hope they keep up the good work.",

I also loved that everyone served as part of the wait staff, including the chef himself. Everyone was so warm and personable and excited to be there I almost felt like I was in a sitcom about a restaurant.  **My only negative feedback was that the hostess refused to acknowledged that we had to wait even though we had a reservation - a personal pet peeve of mine after working in the service industry for years.

Tip: I was told that the walk-in wait is only an hour. not bad in my opinion! i absolutely think the wait is worth it. especially for the price. you won't be shelling hundreds of dollars per person (unless you order a shit ton of wine and everything on the menu).  i came here with a party of 4 and highly recommend doing just this.

If you answered, \"YES\" to all of \u00a0the above, then you will love State Bird Provisions.  SBP is discreetly located in the FillMo'. Having just opened on NYE, it's still without any signage. However, you can't miss it being next door to the glowing neon signs of Won Mi, a Korean restaurant that I personally banned myself from after nearly taking down a wall of banchans at 2:30 AM. Um yah, we won't even get started on that one. :X  SBP's menu consists of inventive and adventurous American Tapas flawlessly executed with fresh, seasonal ingredients seamlessly paired together creating culinary mini-masterpieces with well balanced flavors and textures. There is no set menu. Each night, about 14-16 dishes come around a la dim sum carts/trays. See something you like? Point and get it. In my case, this is why I LOVE dim sum aka The 'SEE'food Diet, I get to eat EVERYTHING I see.  F O O D *Prices: $2-12/dish; most were $6-$8 *3-4 dishes/person is sufficient  An average of 4 STARS, below are the dishes we sampled last night listed from my most favorite to least favorite.   *BRAISED OXTAIL in 7-Pepper Flatbread <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=his4rctu01DufHji4ayNtw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  The STAR of the night, the warm, crisp, and fluffy flatbread was generously filled with savory tender shreds of oxtail. The light smearing of yogurt sauce gave a delightful layer of creamy tanginess.   *FRIED QUAIL w/ Lemon Stewed Onions  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=iwOeKyVnU4ETyMSGzaP4Sw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  Deliciously crunchy on the outside and succulently moist in the center, the fried quail was lip smacking good. The citrus from the onions added a ray of sunshine while the parmigiano-reggiano gave a savory saltiness.  *TROFIE PASTA w/ Dungeness Crab &amp; Pancetta <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=7tMUHZyVKnOpaYQP83MKhw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  A perfect rendition of a pasta surf and swine, the al-dente twisted pasta married the sweet crab meat with a scrumptious crisp, fatty richness from the pancetta bits.   *PORK RIBS in a Pork Broth <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=M8S8ZhLzcgsOfTSdH-hlKw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  The carniwhore in me rejoiced with these ribs. The subtle smoky ribs were crisp around the edges and tender on the inside. The broth was like an au jus imparting a layer of briny saltiness.  *BEEF TONGUE PASTRAMI CROSTINI w/ Bone Marrow Sauce <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=HglYLlN9ybLUTL-yvfTxLA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  The holy grail of all crostinis, the beef tongue pastrami was delectably smooth and salty. The bits of bone marrow added a burst of beefy richness while the acidity of the red onion marmalade helped cut through the richness.  *RYE BREADED BEETS w/ Horseradish Kale <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=gn3en_uxjtBhwxLEiSV_Hg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  I loath beets but this dish made me a beet convert. Nicely coated with rye bread crumbs, the beets were fried to a robust golden brown and then lightly smeared with the horseradish kale sauce. Crisp, tender, and sweet, the beets were wonderfully delicious with a light nose tingle from the horseradish.  *BRUSSEL SPROUTS w/ Squid &amp; Mandarin Oranges <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=mXNBwRyhPpkZhAwxmWr8zw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  Crunchy brussels sprouts with tender squid tossed with sweet vibrant oranges made me miss the rare summer days in SF.  *FARRO w/ Wild Mushrooms &amp; Parmesan <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=Qe8J-jC-2nlYdc-AJ4EEuA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  Reminiscent of risotto, the farro grain was tender with a bite. The wild mushrooms and parmesan added an mouth-watering earthiness and a salty creaminess.  *DUCK NECK DUMPLINGS  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQGRJZ4bZCmNoXjs3z1XQ?select=fUg_cGOXSu7u_ZfGtqcqSA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG\u2026</a>  My least fav dish of the night, the pan-fried skin was too thick and very doughy which hindered the taste of the duck neck. The broth was also very salty.  S E R V I C E Considering they've only been open 10 days, the staff operates just as flawlessly as the food. They're warm, genuinely friendly, and knowledgeable.  We got a chance to chat with co-owner, Stuart Brioza (Rubicon) who was a cool cat. The immense passion he has is emanated in the careful and artful preparation of the food and the attentive service of his staff.   A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Casual and inviting, SBP's open kitchen is the highlight of this 40+-seating restaurant. As you're waiting to be seated, your eyes and your nose will be tantalizingly teased on what's to come.   Dimly lit and not overly noisy, it's a great place to take a foodie on a date.  P A R K I N G Difficult street parking on weekends. There's a garage 1 block away across from Yoshi's; $3 for the 1st hour, $1 for each add'l hour.   SBP is a living testament that a Menage A Trois DOES work! Honey, don't knock it till you've tried it...",

Off the menu we ordered a pancake dish, a half order of the Ca state bird and the bacon curry sweetbreads. For dessert we had the berry granita and saffron ice cream sandwiches. Everything was yummy. The only item we would probably skip next time would be the garlic burrata bread since it was a little heavy. Overall a great dining experience and would go again to try other dishes.",

They serve about 12-14 small dishes per night (we only saw about 8 circulate in the hour we were there) and several made to order dishes on the menu. \u00a0  I thought all of the dishes were tasty, but I really liked the sauerkraut cheese pancakes, the quail (state bird), these little sweet corn breads with pate. I like that you can sit down and immediately start eating (just like dim sum)!   Overall, food was fun and interesting, service was great. I would come back.

On to the food. \u00a0Pork Riblets was so good that we had to get seconds. \u00a0We also tried the fried pork belly in some kind of citrus dressing with dill, cilantro and grapefruit. \u00a0The dressing balanced out the fat and richness of the pork belly perfectly. \u00a0Flavors on top of flavors on top of flavors. \u00a0We also ordered their grilled steak from their menu but while it was good, was not as good at the riblets or pork belly.  My favorite dish of the night was their salmon tartare(?) on top of cucumbers sprinkled with some sort of crunchy benito or seaweed flakes. \u00a0Anyways, try it if you like sushi, you won't regret it. \u00a0Also had their raw halibut on top of seaweed with avocado and other things. \u00a0All in all, a great dinner for our first trip to State Bird. \u00a0I will definately come back here again.",

We had about 10 dishes and one was good, two were very good, and the remaining were sublime! \u00a0In the \"sublime\" bucket is: hamachi &amp; avocado seaweed crostini; red trout; tuna crudo; ricotta dumplings; sourdough sauerkraut ricotta pancakes; and peking duck among others.  While eating, I met the owner and instinctively stood up to speak with him out of deference because it was so amazing and couldn't have been nicer or more humble. \u00a0  Brilliant!!!!",

This is Ryan Anderson, General Manager of State Bird Provisions, writing to explain a particularly unfortunate and unexpected situation that occurred for online reservations facilitated Tuesday (3/25) and Wednesday (3/26). We have just completed the transition to OpenTable as our new reservations system, a change that we are thrilled about as it incorporates many new features that will improve our guests' experiences. We are a small restaurant with the great fortune of being quite busy, so part of this move involved migrating thousands of existing reservations to the new system -- a big undertaking that we took very seriously. Nonetheless, in that move, some reservations were inadvertently opened to the web that did not in fact represent available tables. Now, much to our chagrin, we've had to cancel your reservation because we quite simply don't have the space to honor that spot along with our existing reservations and walk-in guests. We truly apologize for the great inconvenience -- and any disappointment -- this caused. We are in the business of serving people and making people happy, so it's a huge letdown for us to have to say no this time around. We would be delighted to have you join us again in the future; please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about how to do that. Your understanding is sincerely appreciated, and we so look forward to sharing our food, atmosphere, and hospitality with you on one of those other nights very soon.",

The food comes out on trays and carts. \u00a0Most of the time they rotate clockwise, once in a while they mix it up and go counterclockwise. \u00a0So, you want to sit in the middle column, closer to the front of the restaurant to get first dibs! \u00a0Of course, since the restaurant is in such high demand you are rarely able to choose your table. \u00a0If you're stuck in the back (like we were the second time) you can always creepily peer around at what other people are eating (no shame!) and ask your server about the dishes. \u00a0There's no rule that says you have to wait for the trays!  My favorite dish here so far was only available the first visit - a potato puree. \u00a0I could describe it in words and it would not do it justice. \u00a0Everything was thoughtfully made. \u00a0My best suggestion would be to try everything that sounds good. \u00a0And everything will sound good - that's why they come in small plates! You can try everything! \u00a0(Don't forget the items only available by ordering off the menu). \u00a0The state bird is crispy and succulent, the garlic bread with burrata is fluffy and warm, the farro salad was refreshing with a surprising depth.

When we arrived at 9 it was another 45 minute wait standing awkwardly in their narrow corridor waiting for a table to open up. Their system is really terrible, they have your cell phone number, I'm not sure why they can't just send you away to have drinks elsewhere and give you a call when your tables ready?! Instead, the (very polite) host kept telling us tables were about to open up in the next few minutes and that we were the next table to be seated and then proceeded to seat other parties before us. It's really not fun to be lied to...  The food cart is way too slow, and we waited far too long for the cart to show up at out table by which time it was empty and we had to choose from the scraps other tables didn't want... By this time we were starving and I had to ask our waitress to bring us something, ANYTHING for us to try. The wait staff are really lovely and friendly. The food was good, really loved their duck mousse, the rabbit we were told was served with romesco but it was quite obviously not romesco sauce but some sort of cold green guacamole beany thing, found the rabbit to be a bit on the dry side and overly salty, the garlic bread with burrata was divine, the deep fried quail dish was perfectly balanced with its accompaniments and peanut milk was deliciously simple.  We had their cocoa ice cream sandwich which I found to be far too sweet and not enjoyable. I would recommend the place to others but this restaurant really needs to work on their seating system if they want happy diners!

With the exception of those seated at the rear of the restaurant, everyone is virtually seated at a chef's table with chef Stewart standing a few feet from you, orchestrating his band, expediting his take on, \"New Californian\" cuisine.  After a stroll around Japantown and the Filthymo' along with an hour and a half long wait outside their unmarked restaurant me and the lady embarked on the yummy culinary journey chef Stewart was gonna take us on. While we had no reservations we were among the first in a line that looked as though some Jordans were about to be re-released.   We were seated on the little sidebar situated on the left side of the line where you get this really awesome view of the interaction between chef Stewart and his crew. We watch as a cart comes around with food, and being in close proximity to the kitchen we get first dibs! Fu*k yeah.. So you have the option to order off the cart or the menu, a la dim sum style. I start to get all food nerd dumb with excitement like some kid at a Gamestop as I try to match the pictures I've seen on Yelp to the treys and carts passing me by.  Nearly everything I scarfed down was pretty bomb. Clean, flavorful and balanced. Wasn't too impressed by the State Bird though. I suppose I didn't like the broth taking all that nice bit of crunch from what already is a tiny bird. Having dined a few days earlier at some of Wine Country's gems, this here once jaded culinary worker ended it by proclaiming State Bird without a doubt the one of the best and most unique dining experiences I've ever experienced in my life. That sashimi seaweed cracker thing, the shisho leaves drink, the seemingly mundane sourdough pancake, and that tres leche were all just mind blowing.   I'm talmbout Ho Lee S#!+ good.  Working in a professional kitchen it was such as breath of fresh air to hear the very knowledgeable head server Emily (who was also main bartender of the night) explain to us that they rotate positions to cross-train each other in order to ultimately appreciate each other's position. While this maybe nothing new to certain industries, however for mine is fairly unheard of considering I'm used to working in kitchens with a more a structured, traditional, highly militarized approach where you pretty much put your head down, shut your trap and go to work. As opposed to State Bird's seemingly more open-minded, democratic approach to cooking.   To hear that during family meals they are all working together trying to conceptualize new ideas instead of some stuffy head chef who won't take no for an answer and to see their GM, Mr. Anderson come up to you and take his time to see how you're doing while he's out there bussin' azz while bussin' tables you quickly realize that they truly are passionate about what they do. You have some cats that just talk about their \"love\" of the craft then you have the crew at State Bird Provisions whose actions speak louder. It's all beautiful. Poetry in motion.   To simply gauge SBP by it's food without taking into account its service, business concept and execution from the bottom up would be an extreme disservice to as the restaurant truly reflects the Bay Area's ever changing, evolving, open and diverse way of living. Chefs Stewart and Nicole make for the best one two combo if I've ever seen one.  I left amazed, excited and inspired once again.",

If you can find a friend with an Amex platinum card, that would really be the way to go as they can hook you up with some last minute seating.   My favorite is the state bird dish, the sunny side quail eggs, duck liver mouse, duck fried rice, albacore, oysters, and a whole slew of dimsum dishes I don't remember the names to. The thing with this dimsum style of service is that you can rack up quite a huge tab without realizing it. We ended up finishing off $150 worth of food between two people during our latest visit (BUT WE EAT A LOT). I would say you are looking at around $80-90 including tip for two if you are conservative....   I always wish that I had more room for the different desserts, so I would try to save some room for them... if you can. And you probably won't be able to because servers walking around with those small plates of mouth water food.... I always default to the ice cream sandwiches though because they are seriously the most unique and best I've ever had. Oolong tea ice cream sandwich is delicious!   Service was also super friendly. Can be a bit of a madhouse and you might have to wait to get someone's attention.   Definitely recommend the experience and the food. Only downsides are the prices (they are a bit high for the novelty) and the ridiculous wait for both non-reservations and reservations.",

I was \"surprised\" when the boyfriend landed a last-minute reservation for two on a Saturday night ;)  The setting is intimate, I always love open kitchens (though fiance tried hard to convince me to sit facing the other direction), the wall decor is fun, and the lone bathroom is super clean and posh. The staff is really friendly and proactive, and explained how to order (unlike some restaurants with unique concepts who assume you can figure it out on your own). They have a combination of made-to-order items that include the famous State Bird with Provisions, and other items come out of the open kitchen on trays and sometimes carts. They usually only put out 4 plates of each dish out at a time, but since every table is at a different point in their meal, you don't feel anxious to grab dishes as they came, as you would at a traditional dim sum restaurant. The pace is steady, we had about 2-3 dishes on our table most of the night, and we pretty much tried all but a few dishes. My favorite was definitely the heirloom cherry tomatoes on a zesty blended eggplant bed that reminded me of babaghanouj. We were recommended some great wines, and the dessert was so delicoius, combining some of my favorite ingredients in a minty pistachio ice cream chocolate sandwich with a raspberry sauce.  They said they're closing down temporarily to remodel-- the waitress said they're opening up the space to allow more room for carts. Can't wait for them to re-open, we'll be back again! :D",

Now that I have that off of my chest.   I am so impressed by Stuart Brioza, his vision, his crew, their humbleness in the face of huge success. They treat the customer so well and are so nice this made a huge impact on me. Yeah Ryan gosling ate here and so do a ton of well to dos......but everyone is treated with love and respect here.  My hat is also off to Stuart for not going nopa soma fidi or what have you...but doing something in a neighborhood that could really use it. Yeah panda express, sushi boom II, and Poppeye's doesnt really help the area..imho. It could have been rent considerations.  I appreciate that Stuart came by the table raving about his anchovies and taking the time to explain where they get them, what they do to them etc. BTW...I have never had anchovies like this....they were amazing. The man is a genius.  Ah the details. This place aint cheap: Four people was roughly $260 (this is without tip so add another 20%) and that is with me bringing a bottle of wine! But you pay for what you get and what you get is handcrafted, unique, beautiful quality food, in an amazing atmosphere.  Okay my tips to you: If you want to get in without a reservation get there at 4:35 ( I know it is crazy but it is what it is). If you are 14 or less in line you will get in no problem. I love that they only reserve half the tables....this is what I mean about treating everyone right.  If you can get in before the close ( not everyone wants to eat at 5:30???_) say 10 minutes to 10 they will offer you the same show...all the carts and all the food....again treating the customer right.  They are expanding to next door so that should take some of the pressure off reservations.  Thanks Stuart and crew, Chuck, and Anne...it was ahmazing!!!  Definitely worth eating here!!!",

Although the interior may be far from stunning, the food certainly is.   Style: State Bird Provisions utilizes the dim-sum concept found in some Chinese restaurants. The menus found at every table consists of their staple items including their namesake \"CA State Bird w/ Provisions\", wines and desserts. Throughout the entirety of your meal servers will come around with different items not found on the menu. They will give you a brief explanation about the dish and then you get to decide whether to take it or not.  Food: Every dish I had at State Bird was marvelous. The tastes were complex and the small serving sizes ensured that I got to try a large variety of dishes. My personal recommendation is the \"CA State Bird w/ Provisions\", it was a \"tastier fried chicken\" and everybody acknowledged that it was highly enjoyable.   Overall: State Bird Provisions is a restaurant is a phenomenal restaurant with good service and fantastic taste. Although it is not the cheapest dim-sum you can get, I highly recommend this establishment to everyone.",

If I were a culinary artist, this would be the format I would choose by which to express my artistry. \u00a0I would be moved to capture fleeting thoughts inspired upon seeing a beautiful bouquet of fresh vegetables, colorful shades of edible flowers, or fish that literally jumped out of the sea into my lap. \u00a0Life is to celebrate these things.  Anyhoo, I don't know if these are the things that inspire chef State Bird, but I sure am glad he shares his love for life and his culinary inspiration with the rest of us, in little portions. \u00a0You know he has vivid imagination, as he can throw together unlikely and complex pairings of ingredients, or present simple ingredients, as they are (nasturtium and balsamic ricotta?). \u00a0As with all artistic creations, not everything works perfectly, but I am just as glad to be on the ride to experience someone else's inspired moments. \u00a0It feels honest and genuine.  As everyone says, the wait was very long (got in line at 5:30 to get a standing spot at 8:45, but the time estimate given to us by the hostess was quite accurate). \u00a0Nonetheless, I was amazed at how calm the chefs in the kitchen were. \u00a0In contrast to the perceived craziness (maybe it was more excited anticipation) of hungry-people-waiting-in-line-in-tiny-dining-room, the chefs in the kitchen were so not Hells-Kitchen, they were zen, calm and collected, and warm and friendly. \u00a0In the middle of making yummy corn pancakes, the lady chef who happened to see me watching flashed a warm smile. \u00a0And everyone else patiently answered my million and one questions, and one chef even put together a dish we requested even though it was not in his rotation. \u00a0  They say they will be closed after August 11, 2013 for remodeling. \u00a0I hope it's for expansion, although hopefully its charm won't be lost in the process.",

The second time we booked a reservation 2 months in advance with a party of 6. We had a table to ourselves and were given food off their entire menu. I've never felt such a complete loss of words when I eat here, its simply out of this world. I eat things here that I don't even like usually and every bite is better than the next. One of the dishes was a tomato dish with some quinoa. Now usually i'd stay clear of these, but o.m.g. their chefs work their magic in the kitchen. We ended up getting additional dessert even though we were full because its just that good.  Came back again a few months later, because anything more than a few months away from this place is too long. Noticed they didnt have the hen dumplings in their dim sum rotation and we inquired about it. The chef whipped it out and made us a batch, it was stellar!!

But I honestly didn't see what all the hype was about. I certainly don't feel State Bird Provisions is Michelin star quality...   Let's start with the 'getting a reservation same day' experience. Honestly, incredibly easy. But count on (if you're not in line well before open) that you will likely be getting a table or the chef's counter sometime around or after 8:30 PM. I waited in line for no more than 30 minutes and was face to face with the host who then gave me a reservation for 8:45 PM for two. Enough time for me to go home and do a bit of work and chores.  The service was very good. Sometimes a bit awkward. It was like everyone was on a different rhythm.   The food was either incredibly underwhelming or overwhelming and not in the best ways. I liked the dim sum style dining experience.  Here is what we had:   Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - the duck liver mousse was similar to foie gras, obviously. The almond biscuit, while fine, tasted undercooked and almost was something I had half expected to get at Safeway in a bag near the deli.  King salmon tartare with fermented turnips - This was pretty good, but the salmon was lacking the delicious sweetness it usually comes with. I think this was definitely offset by the fermentation, would have been nice to get more balance without canceling out some of the rich flavours of the salmon.  Melon &amp; goat cheese - Something was particularly salty with this one...so salty we didn't finish it. Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms &amp; pink peppercorn - This was like a loaded potato...when I eat bone marrow I don't expect to have it overwhelmed with various other confusing flavours. The pink peppercorn was a bit much. CA state bird with provisions - Really small (even for a quail), deep fried, unimpressive.  Potato croquette with beef tongue pastrami - Pastrami was really good, the croquette was okay. Paprika lamb shank dumplings in broth - Probably the best thing we had all night...but sadly the first thing we ate. Would have been a nice finisher.   ...none of these were particularly memorable, sadly.  It was pretty affordable, so that was the only saving grace. I would come back again, but only if someone else wanted to stand in line",

New Kids On The Block + Backstreet Boys (NKOTBSB) = actually... that might be the exception. I love terrible pop music. Secretly, I'm hoping one day for a Biebas duo to hit the road (Justin Bieber + Nick Jonas). \u00a0  Well, when I heard the news of a fresh concept combining new-American fare with dim sum just steps from my 350 square foot studio apartment, I was intrigued to say the least... and after being open for roughly four weeks, I was able to pop in and experience the magic of State Bird Provisions first hand. Suffice to say from the gaggle of glowing reviews accumulated already, you don't need me to reveal their gustatory super group concept won't soon be the Power Station of San Francisco eateries.  Upon original speculation, I envisioned this place to be exactly like a dim sum restaurant with rolling carts chock-full of odd looking mystery vittles that you hope don't make you incredibly ill hours into the night. However, while that's certainly a staple standout of their dinner service, it's more of a fun attribute to a brilliant static menu. Still, fun, and incredibly uncommon. They encourage you to order roughly half of your menu items (small, tapas style) from the physical scribe, then treat your taste buds to a handful of the passed plates that do, indeed, arrive at your table by way of a four-wheeled tumbrel. It's really fun, and certainly a unique way to enjoy a night on the town.  Spanning both the physical menu and the passed plates, you'll find items like Drake's Bay oysters in the half shell, vegetable crudite with goat cheese &amp; toasted sesame, marinated halibut with yuzu-jalapeno vinaigrette, marinated mushrooms with vanilla-parsnip &amp; hazelnuts, kimchi-pork belly &amp; clam broth, glazed pork ribs, and at least 10-12 other courses appealing to any kind of eater.   They even have one or two dessert items making the rounds throughout the dining room, and it's about as challenging as solving a Rubik's Cube to let the sweet treats drift off into the distance. I don't have as much of a palate for sugar, otherwise I'd have gobbled up those sacchariferous digestifs faster than a bee stung stallion.  Changes of pace are nice when you've grown tired of the usual dining routine, and if the quality of taste and ingredients rivals a clever, outside-the-box concept, you're in for a real treat. In Lower Pac Heights, State Bird Provisions is that treat, and one I hope to indulge in far too often.",

Showed up at 5:15 and there was a line of people around the block without reservations. \u00a0Out of my way, people, I have a reservation :) \u00a0Anyway. Was seated right away. \u00a0  State Bird does have a menu that you can order off of - but the highlight are the special off-the-menu items that are presented to you. \u00a0The staff comes to your table, dim sum style, and explains the dish and the ingredients used, the price of the item, and you have the option of saying yes or no. \u00a0One of the MOST amazing thing I consumed was the garlic bread with fresh burrata and oregano. \u00a0Another 'must order' (from the menu) is the Uni pancake - seriously, so freaking incredible. \u00a0These two items in particular have me still dreaming of the next time I can go back to this restaurant again! \u00a0  The staff comes around to your table - A LOT. \u00a0So it is somewhat disruptive if you are in the middle of the conversation. But by the same token, I did not feel rushed or like they were trying to rush us out of the restaurant to accommodate the line of people outside. They are just trying to be attentive and make sure to present everything being offered that night :) \u00a0I didn't mind. \u00a0 Other highlights in terms of the food were the Guinea hen dumpling, pork ribs, oysters, salmon tartare (omg), smoked trout, duck. \u00a0SIDE NOTE -- I gave up my vegan ways to fully indulge and immerse myself in everything this restaurant had to offer -- and I am so glad I did!",

We were seated quickly, and the courses began.  Everything was so artfully done, from the trendy interior to our waitress's attention. I can't even remember everything I ate, but I do remember that our bill came up to be around $60 per person, tax and tip included. My friend and I felt kind of out of place, and we may have peeked over at the table next to us when we were confused about eating some of the dishes, but it worked fine for us. Each bite was heaven, and I especially remember the homemade chips and salmon/avocado tartare. The spicy beef was okay, but that was the only average dish to me.

There are kitchen items that are on the printed menu...the prices range from $8 (dessert or pancakes items) to over $20.... These are items that are always there... The rest are 12 different small plate dishes that will be offered by either a cart or by tray to your table with price tags on them so you can see what you're actually getting and how much each dish would cost you.  From the Printed (kitchen) menu, we ordered half of State Bird Provision which is basically deep fried Quail. The quail was very juicy but tiny (well, it's quail.. so no surprise with the small size duh!). Good but not fantastic or out of this world.. and I thought it could use a pinch of salt.  For the tapa items (the dishes that were offered table side) we ordered: - Porridge with mixed mushrooms, pickled radish and cheese - DELICIOUS, very rich, hearty and just yummm yummm yumm... - Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits - Agreed with most people that this was also delicious. The mousse was very smooth and the almond biscuits were a tad sweet, a great compliment to the eat with the mousse..yummmm - Some kind of bread with Buratta (cheese) with herbs and garlic - This one was a bit of a let-down.. It wasn't warm enough and greasy..and basically it was just a deep-fried-looking dough with melted cheese...nothing special (or the correct way to put it...I have had better flavored buratta) - Quinoa salad with Kale and Mushrooms -- REfreshing, making me feel healthy but needs some salt for more kick of the flavor.  - Chawanmushi with mushroom and bacon bits - must, must must order!! very yummmm and not just because of the bacon but the steam egg was flavorful and comforting!!! and cannot beat the $3 price!!! - Guinea hen dumpling -- \u00a0a bit put-off by the size (you get one dumpling/order) but it was only $3 and certainly worth it!!! delicious, the skin was a bit chewy (in a good way) and filling was packed with flavor yummm yummm yummm and the broth was just delicious!!!!  Portions were SMALL but to my surprise... we (two of us) were FULL by the end of the meal...(Although we did go for coldstone afterwards ahahahah)...

I am sooooooooo happy she did! This place is deliciously mouth watering good!!!! \u00a0I absolutely love the idea of dim sum style carts that come around with different types of yumminess! I love this concept because you actually get to try different things and not get stuck with just one meal. So many tastes, flavors, aromas waking you up to some new experience! \u00a0  We ordered two things to start off with from the menu.. the State Bird provision and the Duck fried rice! Then the carts started coming around! *totally wiggling just thinking about it* hahaha... MmmmaMmm   between the two of us we tried the garlic bread with Burrata, hog island oysters, guinea hen dumpling with aromatic soup, salmon tartare, duck ham with umeboshi vinigarette, this chip and dip they had.. forgot the name of it... and for dessert the ice cream sandwiches!!! DROOOOOL  Everything listed was absolutely delicious. \u00a0My favorite out of all of the food we ate was hands down the duck fried rice!!! its a total must!!!",

    "review_text": "SBP's been on my list for quite some time now, long before they were named Best Restaurant in America by Bon Appetit. Of course, with my mile-long list of bookmarks, I never made it out here until reservations became notoriously difficult to book (pro-tip: check every morning, as they're on a rolling 60 day schedule - and once you're booked, don't cancel!)  For those unfamiliar with the theme at SBP, their modus operandi is, \"eat with your eyes.\" Think of it as New American food, served dim sum style. The waitstaff wander about the restaurant with little trays of freshly made dishes, each carrying a little price tag on them: simply ask for whatever catches your eye. That said, there are a handful of entrees that are actually only available as orders off the menu, so make sure you don't miss out on those. Our group of three ended up ordering their [ <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FReuH-SQflI%2F&amp;s=00806f750e8da94ca2d673f1bd193a420f2324c7c3e681b95f292d752e6f54c9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/p/ReuH-SQf\u2026</a> ]:  == Tasty! ==  * Shrimp, Avocado, Nori * Steak Tartare with Poblano &amp; Sunchoke  == Good ==  * CA State Bird with Provisions * Kimchi-Pork Belly with Tofu * Fried Green Tomato, Eggplant, Spanish Remoulade  == Okay ==  * Guinea Hen Dumplings * Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuit * Sweet Corn &amp; Garlic Chive Shortstack  So, overall, while nothing was terrible, nothing was mind-blowingly delicious either. Still, the experience is unique enough, and some of the dishes are tasty enough, that it's worth trying at least once. Not to mention that the service is great, and the owners are awesome folks :)  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - Fairly spacious, but more length-wise than evenly, with table arrangements that are a little bit tight, but still maneuverable. Be sure to let them know your situation beforehand though, and they should accommodate you at some of the slightly more accessible tables.  Bathroom - It's been a while, but if I remember correctly, their bathrooms were absolutely accessible.",

We were seated at the bar, right by the kitchen, so we were able to watch the chefs prep and also get first dibs on anything coming out of the kitchen. \u00a0That said, the food was amazing--creative, tasty, and inspiring. \u00a0Definitely try the quail, and anything with tuna or yellowtail. \u00a0We also loved the fried garlic bread with burrata--decadent but oh-so-delicious. The waitstaff was friendly, very helpful, and not at all overwhelming. I liked the dim sum style--portions were small enough that you could try multiple plates, and we were out of there for about $100. \u00a0I was disappointed in the desserts--we ordered two, and I thought they just didn't stand up to the quality of the savory dishes we'd tried.",

    "review_text": "We'd been sitting on a gift card for over a year. \u00a0We have a hard enough time coordinating a babysitter for our toddler, let alone booking reservations months in advance or waiting hours in line.  However, one night in November I just so happened to be awake at 4AM (see above re: toddler) and managed to book a coveted Friday night reservation. \u00a0When I checked again at 4:05 AM, everything was already gone.  Two months later, we arrived-- 20 minutes late for our hard-won reservation! \u00a0As we raced down the street, I steeled myself for the inevitable confrontation with the staff at such a popular place. \u00a0  I needn't have worried. \u00a0The hostess greeted us warmly, apologized for giving our table away, and brought us glasses of complimentary champagne while we waited for another. \u00a0Every staff member we encountered throughout the night was similarly warm, enthusiastic, and laid-back.  The food was uniformly solid. \u00a0All of it was inventive. \u00a0And some of it was sublime-- in addition to the quail and garlic bread dishes that are much discussed, we absolutely loved a duck ham pancake that we ordered off the menu. \u00a0And the desserts were the highlight, especially the chocolate roll cake with sesame mousse.  Was it the best meal we ever ate? \u00a0No. \u00a0Is it over-hyped? \u00a0Probably. \u00a0But I can totally understand why it is so popular. \u00a0The space, the concept, the approach are all sui generis. \u00a0In a town where it's easy to take good restaurants for granted, this is truly a great one-- because there's nothing else like it.  And as always seems to happen on our long-awaited date nights, who should get seated next to us but a harried-looking couple toting a toddler who did not seem as enthused to be there as the rest of the crowd. \u00a0As they awkwardly wedged their stroller through the crowd waiting for a table I saw more than a few eyes roll.  But the hostess? \u00a0She welcomed them smiling, helped stash away the stroller, brought out a high chair. \u00a0We watched every server come up and interact with the baby. \u00a0The chef himself stopped by the table several times, even brought out some special child-friendly treats from the kitchen.  And this is why this place gets 5 stars in my book. \u00a0Arguably the hippest place in town, certainly the hardest to book. \u00a0But none of the attitude that usually accompanies such feats. \u00a0Rather than trumpeting their exclusivity, they've created an atmosphere that's warm and welcoming, food that's delicious, and an overall experience that's truly memorable.",

The line looked ridiculous and i felt like i was hot shit being let in first right when they opened.   my most favorite plates: 1) crispy pork belly. sooooo yummy and all of the ingredients really did mesh well together. (plum, vinaigrette sauce, bronze fennel) 2) bone marrow- there was a ton of shit in this plate...i couldn't tell you what exactly, but it was perfect with the sea salt.   everyone says the ca state bird with provisions is the best, but honestly i thought it was overhyped. it was tasty, but not the highlight of my meal. just tasted like a different type of fried chicken.   the waiters/waitresses deserve 5 stars. they were extremely attentive and knew every detail about each dish. we ordered about 11-12 dishes that were split between 2, the bill came out to around $110. not bad considering i was pretty full and i have a heavy appetite. i'd like to say that i'd come back, but i fear the itchiness and rashes. would recommend it to anyone anyday though!",

Best ones were the hamachi sashimi, salmon tartare, octopus and of course the pork belly.  I was disappointed with their specialty- THE QUAIL.. Being it the \"STATE BIRD\" I was expecting a unique preparation and presentation. However it was a shock to see that it was just plainly BREADED!!!! I was expecting roasted with some kind of specialty sauce but it was just fried and breaded. Truly disappointed...

I was really expecting to be blown away by this place but unfortunately no. Being the best two chefs of the year , you would expect an extra ordinary experience ..... But no....

The space is small and loud, but comfortable. \u00a0Three beers on tap span a variety from light to dark to a very nice IPA. \u00a0Wine available by the bottle and glass.  We were seated remarkably on-time for our reservations. \u00a0Street parking was easy to find close by on Webster street. \u00a0Walk-ins had a 1.5hr wait at 7pm on a Monday night.  Unlike most dimsum places, they have a menu of items you can order from the kitchen that doesn't overlap with the passed items.  There's a cart of seafood dishes, but otherwise the servers walk around with trays.  Hilights: \u00a0Duck liver mouse - almost perfect. \u00a0Steak Tartare - very good, though a small portion. \u00a0Seafood \"salsa\". \u00a0Sea urchin pancake was amazing. \u00a0My companion loved the sweetbread meatball. \u00a0Beef cheek curry was good.  Lolights: Mt. Tam pancake was perhaps a little over-bacony and oily for our taste. \u00a0Shrimp avocado nori was not particularly interesting in flavor. \u00a0Cumin lamb was an oily stir fry without strong cumin or lamb flavors. \u00a0Honey nut tart was a bit heavy on the nut component.  Also - you are almost required to get the \"state bird\" - a fried quail. \u00a0It's good, but so rich that a half order was enough for the two of us.  The place is not cheap - the little dishes add up. \u00a0Say $100/person is not unreasonable.  Overall - liked the concept, some good food, some duds. \u00a0Would go back.",

I bit into a whole peppercorn and that's all I could taste. The trout dish (which was on the menu) was so salty that it overpowered all other flavors....and basically, that was the theme for the evening for the 6 things we got: each dish had an ingredient that dominated and the food suffered due to it. So did our taste buds.  I really wanted to like the meal. My friend had to make a reservation a month in advance so there was much anticipation, but also, when we arrived, everyone who worked there just seemed so nice, so I feel bad for writing this 2 star review, but the food really was disappointing.   Maybe it was an off night or we just got the \"wrong\" things, but a truly great restaurant is consistent and not \"hit or miss.\"   I'm glad others had a great experience here.

    "review_text": "There are two options if you want to eat at this new michelin star restaurant. Option 1: You get a reservation. Reservations are booked 1 month in advance and it's first come first serve on their website. The reservations come out at like 4am or something ridiculous like that and there are people with programs that get those reservations. Those new money, silicon valley computer engineers. So good luck getting a reservation. Option 2: you walk in and try to see if you can get a seat for dinner that evening. My girlfriend and I showed up at 4:30pm and waited an hour in line outside the restaurant before they opened at 5:30pm and there were still around 20 people in front of us. San Francisco gets crazy when it comes to food. We ended up getting a seat for 8pm that night. We walked around the neighborhood and went to a bar to enjoy the NBA All Star game while waiting for our reservation. If you get on the list as a walk in they take your phone number and text you when your reservation is ready. Our reservation was like 30 mins early so we walked over when we received the text. We were told we would be seated at the chefs table which is right in front of the kitchen so you can watch them work. If you can, get those seats and I will explain why.  The concept of the restaurant is western dim sum. They walk around with small plates and tapas on a seafood cart for your fishy options. They also bring around trays of other bites to eat in various intervals. They also have a menu so you can order kitchen items as well.   From the seafood cart we only got the oysters and if you can, get around 5 or so. Raw oysters with a crunchy slaw or something on top. Good texture to start with.  From the small plates they bring around and options from the menu we had plenty. Here is what you should try: Riblets (tender and with a sweet sauce), pork belly (soft pork belly with a vinegar sauce and cilantro/jalapeno and grape salad), bone marrow (just trust me bro), beef tartare (make a lettuce wrap with it and get the party in your mouth started), duck liver mousse with almond biscuits (my favorite dish of the night), hamachi nori cracker (pretty much your average tuna with avocado cracker dish at any restaurant, but it was tasty just nothing special or unique other than presentation).   Items you probably won't miss out on: state bird with provisions (fried quail with soggy onions and such), bread with barata (pretty much bread covered with cheese, tasty but you can live without it), a barley or oat dish that looks like risotto? (skip this, just filler without the thriller).  They make in house sodas, we got both the plum and yuzu soda. You can do without the yuzu but you gotta get the plum. It's awesome, refreshing and something new.   For dessert we got everything in a half order that we could because we were bursting at the seams at that point. Desserts that are a must have: Poppy seed ice cream sandwhich (get one for yourself, dont' share. trust me), peanut muscovado milk (it's milk that tastes like peanuts, it's a trip man and it's pretty good like a milk with your desserts, nothing is better).  Desserts you can skip: \u00a0the cornmeal topped with dried fruit (it's good but the dried fruit on top is too overpowering), the chocolate roll cake (just a chocolate cake with orange garnish, don't eat the orange, that was a bad move on my part), asian pear granita (it's interesting but the ginger in the tapioca is too much).  Now let me go back to why you want to sit at the chefs table. Not only did we get a waiter, we were right next to where they bring out all the trays of food they bring around to people. We got first dibs on all the dishes which were hot straight out of the kitchen. We could also ask the chefs cooking the food to put in an order for us and they would hand it to us personally. The service at the chefs table is the best in the house. You sit on stools and get a hook under the counter to hand your jacket. So if you don't have back issues, sit here for sure. You get the best service and first pick from all the food and you know it's fresh since you see it being made and handed right to you.  Overall a wonderful dinning experience. This is an experience everyone should have at least once. If it wasn't impossible to get reservations or inconvenient to wait hours outside for a chance at a table, I would come back again and try dishes I didn't get a chance to. I hear the menu changes every now and then so if they make a lot of changes I might attempt to come back. Come at least once to experience this unique concept and make your decision from there if it's worth a second visit. I am content with my one visit and will wait for hype to die down before attempting to come again. Solid 4 stars overall.",

At the large table, a set tasting menu is served rather than the dim sum style offerings. This is to prevent constant interruption by staff. Instead, the table is delivered every dish on the menu, served family style. It came to about 15 courses all in all. Epic.   The restaurant itself is pleasant looking but a bit spartan. Nothing lavish. The focus is on the food. The service is very professional and friendly. I was impressed that the waitress knew quite a bit about the wine I brought.

Glad we didn't have to deal with all that. Advice, come with at least four people... that way you can try everything they bring out of the kitchen.   State Bird Provisions is nothing short of five stars. Every dish we had was decadent and beyond amazing. The presentation gets a five star rating as well as the fabulous customer service.   Here's what happens once you get shown to your table. The waiter will take your drink orders and then explain how everything works. Choose what you want on the menu. The waiter will put that order in for you. While waiting, other dishes come out on the cute little dim sum cart or on trays. Say yes to all of it. Trust me on this.   Off the menu - we ordered the following: CA state bird with provisions  Maitake &amp; duck fried rice  1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, salsa cruda, pimenton aioli -  Charentais melon ice cream sandwich, ginger coconut milk, raspberry, shiso  Earl grey chiffon cake, chocolate caramel, ricotta, blackberries  From the cart and the trays, we ordered the following: Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame Guinea hen dumplings with aromatic broth Zucchini frites caesar Garlic bread with burrata Pork belly plum salad Air-dried beef with chili juice, rice powder &amp; garlic chips King salmon tartare with fermented turnips Beef tongue pastrami with potato dumplings and green garlic emulsion  WOW, is all I can say.

They serve things in a tapas meets american meets dim sum way, with carts being pushed around with the prices of the American dim sum displayed prominently, but they PUSH them on you to jack up your bill like no place I've ever been to.  The waiter was obsequious, and obviously just trying to get money. There were many people waiting for a table, every host(ess) was polite, but fakely.  I wouldn't go back there even if somebody else were paying.  It was beyond bad. We had almost everything they made, and there was not even ONE DISH that spoke to us, and there were four of us, it's not just me.  The \"ribs\" were Asian Fusion, no smoke, just an Asian style sauce, the meat was tender but no flavor. What's the point? I'd rather have gone to Gorilla.  The lobster salad was OK, but no flavor, the tuna tartar the same, the quinoa so bland I couldn't eat it, the smoked duck had never seen a pack of cigarettes in its life, one of the desserts was completely inedible, we had them take it off the bill, it was texturally disgusting and bland. Imagine completely flavorless sorbet with jicama shavings. Bland bland bland, flavorless.  Did I mention the word bland before?  I have no clue why anyone would want to eat there, and I don't say that about many high-end restaurants. Gary Danko or Quince is 1000x better.

I enjoyed the several different wines we had and was glad to get the tip that if you have an early reservation (which is nearly the only one you can get these days) be prepared to wait in a line outside since there's no where to stand inside. After their Gourmet magazine write up I understand all the fuss over the food but where they are lacking was on the aesthetics. The cute DIY vibe inside would bode better in a boutique rather than a highly revered restaurant in my opinion. Regardless, I will certainly come back.",

    "review_text": "There are a fantastic number of restaurants in San Francisco. \u00a0It really is a foodie town and eating has become one of the things I love most about it. \u00a0But not only is the food what I live for, but also the experience of the meal. \u00a0Coming together with friends and being brought into an installation of decor, atmosphere, and cuisine. \u00a0It makes it for me. \u00a0  I've sat in an array of restaurants, from hole in the walls to Michelin star rated, and I always come with the same openness to the experience. \u00a0Some places have the worst service imaginable BUT the best food so there is a willing sacrifice. \u00a0And some places have food that's good, by no means amazing, but service that's incredible so it shines. \u00a0Not only can the food make a difference in the experience, but the service can as well.  It is a treasure to come to a place that has it all right; fantastic food and extraordinary service. \u00a0  When there's so much hype about a restaurant it's very difficult to not come in without an expectation. \u00a0I had heard nothing but positive things about the food State Bird Provisions so I was prepared to let that part of the experience happen on its own. \u00a0It truly is an amazing accomplishment by the chefs. \u00a0The food was killer, the flavors were excellent, and the meal was a highlight of my eating life in San Francisco.  Along with the incredible food, the front of house staff was beyond. \u00a0From the moment we arrived there was a feeling of being welcomed from everyone. \u00a0The service is based off a dim sum service, so throughout the night you meet a lot of different staff members as they bring you food and everyone who came to our table made a great impression. \u00a0At the same time, our actual server Janice (NOT Jan!) was close by, attentive, and charming.  Food highlights: QUAIL EGGS. \u00a0I could have eaten 5 of those. duck liver mousse with almond biscuit ricotta dumplings with spring onion &amp; sunflower seeds pork belly 'peking duck' lemon curd 'ice cream' sandwich \u00a0!!  The difficulty of getting a reservation should not deter you from trying. \u00a0It is worth the wait and a necessary experience to all foodies in San Francisco. \u00a0And when you do get in, order everything (because it might be a while before you get back in)",

So for those of you that have never been here, they serve their food dim sum style. They have carts that they push around table to table. You can also order some slightly bigger plates that they have on a separate menu. You are probably going to need about 5 dishes per person depending on what you get and the size.   If there is something that you are debating on whether or not to order, order it. We have discovered several dishes that turned out to be one of the better dishes of the night that way. Seriously, just about everything is delicious. Also, try their house made sodas, those are great too.",

The waiters/waitresses encourage you to order the smaller size of what's on the menu so you have more options to try. There were carts rolled around with different kinds of plates throughout the whole night and I wanted to eat everything.  Some of my favorites include the Red Trout with Kishus, Hazelnut-Garum Brown Butter, CA State Bird with Provisions, Pork Spare Ribs, Tombo Tuna- Avocado and Seaweed Cracker, and for dessert, the Coffee Toffee 'Ice Cream' Sandwich with dates, ginger fudge. I guess the list is more than a few. Everything was delicious and it was definitely a treat to come here :)",

    "review_text": "I love this restaurant. My fiancee and I have been lucky enough to go twice in the past 6 months.  The experience here is one you will not find anywhere else. The eclectic mix of the delicious gourmet dishes is quite amazing.  Last time we went we were extremely lucky and got to sit at the 'chefs table' which is basically the bar right in front of the open kitchen. It was such an amazing experience. To watch them create the dishes right in front of you, and also get the chance to choose what you want first! The chefs are amazing and very friendly, we talked with them almost the entire time.   I admit, you need to be a little adventurous to come here, I am a very adventurous eater, but my fianc\u00e9e \u00a0is not as much, but she still loved it. (though she did not try any duck liver mousse or the sweetbread meatballs).  I really have to go back to what an amazing overall experience it is to eat here, all of the dishes are amazing, delicious combinations of ingredients you would sometimes never expect to be together. It is fun to try all the different dishes, allowing you to eat a vast array of things, much much more than you would at any normal restaurant. The best part is that you really don't have to do much deciding. You just have to say YES when that cart or that tray comes around.   One of my favorites was the pork belly and citrus salad. The flavor of the pork and the fat mixed with that citrus (i believe orange and grapefruit) was a delicious explosion in your mouth, the way the citrus cut through the fat was amazing.  Every dish is an experience like that, each bite exploding with flavor.  I really could not recommend this place any higher. The only bad thing is trying to find parking and actually getting reservations! Haha...  Oh, and you have to try the 'world peace' Peanut \u00a0milk with muscovado at the end of your meal. its sooo delicious, its something everyone should experience.",

    "review_text": "Wow. FAN.TAS.TIC. This is absolutely one of my favorite meals I've ever had. Here we go...  THE WAIT No reservations available online. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Friday - ended up being \u00a0around the 12th party in line. Got seated once the doors opened - there were only 2 of us. A group immediately behind me in line had 6 people, and I saw them sit down after we were done eating which means they might have waited 2 more hours AFTER the place opened. Crazy.   SEATING It was larger than I expected inside. I had read that sitting at the counter was the best seat so that will be my goal next time - plus then you can see all the dishes and know that you've seen everything. My friend kept wondering if more food was going to come around and what she was possibly missing out on. Anyway, we were seated at a booth in the back. Very comfy and great view of the whole place. We also had no problems getting to see each dish. Nothing ran out by the time it got to us, or if it did, it came around again later. No need to worry - they will feed you!  THE FOOD! THE FOOD! Where do I begin??? Getting in on the first seating is great because you are starving (after waiting in line) and everything comes out super fast and the flow of food is great. But you also get super excited and want to order EVERYTHING. (Warning: Pace yourself! It's okay to say no to a dish - chances are good that it will come by again later or you can ask your server to bring you some if you decide you want it later.) You can also order off a menu. Here's what we had, and I don't remember the names, so I'll just describe. Mind you, everything here is worthy of being alongside the best tasting menus in SF in my opinion, but I'm rating in comparison to the other dishes that night:  -Beet salad-type dish (3 stars): This was the first thing that came by and I was just so excited and hungry that I ordered it, but it wasn't too memorable.  -Duck mousse w lil dough balls (4.5 stars) -Croquette with duck &amp; fromage (5 stars)  -Pork belly w nectarine (4.5 stars) -State bird w provisions (5 stars) - Got the half, but recommend the whole. But I don't think I got the best part as we split it and it tasted a bit gamey to me. -Pancakes: sourdough &amp; sauerkraut (3.5 stars) - My friend LOVED it; I liked but not love. -Dumpling in lemongrass broth (5 stars) - Flavor explosion -Oysters (4 stars) - I'm not a huge oyster person but these were great, not too fishy tasting either -Trout &amp; avocado mousse w chips (4.5 stars) - We were torn between the trout &amp; salmon. Both looked &amp; sounded amazing. -Garlic bread w bur rata (5 stars) - OMG. Love. -Dessert: Berry tart deconstructed (4 stars)  -Dessert: Ice cream sandwich (3.5 stars) - Ice cream was great, not sure I liked the combo with the rosemary cookie thing; might've preferred to eat them separately -Dessert: Green tea granita (2 stars) - Odd taste combo; not a fan -Dessert: Chocolate cake (2 stars) - We didn't actually order this, but they gave to us by mistake; not really chocolate-y, seed part was not my preference, and just another oddball.  Overall, desserts were a slight let down, but also because the savory dishes were so ridiculously fantastic. We didn't order a few things because we were getting full but I wish we also got the quail eggs and bone marrow. Next time!  SERVICE Excellent! We had the nicest server and he was helpful in guiding us along and suggested half orders here and there as we wanted to try EVERYTHING but weren't sure if we had enough stomach space! Very attentive and stopped by to check on us enough to be considerate and not overbearing.   THE DAMAGE Bill came out to about $120 for two of us, which included 2 glasses of wine. SO WORTH IT!   In the end, was I full? YES, comfortably full. But we still thought about eating more because it was all so good but we stopped short of painfully full. I felt like I'd be hungry again in another hour, but actually I wasn't hungry at all the rest of the evening and we ate at 5:30pm.   Overall, I loved my experience here. It lived up to the hype and more. As we were walking out, I really wanted to leave our name to come back later that night to do it all over again.",

Trust me, it's a good idea to do so now while there are still reservations to be had...if my dinner last night is any indication, a seat at SBP will be a hot ticket in no time.   While being listed under tapas, the cuisine at State Bird Provisions is more like Hipster Dim Sum (Hip Sum?) You have the option of ordering off a set menu as well as picking items off trays and/or a cart being wheeled around the dining room by a friendly, knowledgeable staff. We ended up trying at least 10 different items and left stuffed to the gills. Highlights included duck neck dumplings, beef cheek salad with a bone marrow dressing, homemade potato chips with trout roe, duck prosciutto, pickled veggies with beef tongue, duck rillette with the most amazing financiers and pork belly &amp; clams w/ kimchi stew.  Yes, I listed a lot of highlights but truth be told, everything was fantastic. Actually, the one item I wasn't over the top excited about was the fried quail - it was good but I was glad we ordered the half portion, the hip sum items proved to be the stars. Oh, we also had some great desserts, definitely leave room! (and at prices ranging from $2-$6, it's easy to order a few to split)   State Bird Provisions may be my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco (sorry, Frances) It's easy to create your own 10-12 course tasting menu without breaking the bank, and the atmosphere is incredibly hip and laid back for the quality of the food being produced.

Luckily for us, they save 30% of their seats each night for walk-ins, and our fantastic host, Matt, was able to seat us when we came in for a late night meal. You know how they say that if it's meant to be, it'll be? Yeah, still thanking the universe that this encounter was, for whatever reason, written in the stars. I should have known from the first sip of Riesling I had while waiting that it was going to be a grand evening... skimp on quality, they do not!  Once seated, we were walked through the dining process: there are a few menu staples (though the menu itself rotates frequently... ah, the beauty of eating locally and seasonally), but a lot of dishes are served throughout the night that aren't ever written down, and THOSE are the true highlights, in my opinion. They then mark your menu (a la dim sum) once you say \"yes\" to a dish (either from their trays or carts), and tally up your check at the end.  Though I loved the off-the-menu (and somewhat off-the-wall) dishes, the heart of palm salad (with avocado, nectarine slices, and tahini-chili oil) was perhaps the single best thing I have eaten in the almost four months I've been in California. That salad is the stuff dreams are made of, seriously.  Also dreamy were the CA state bird (lightly fried quail) with provisions (I think I could have eaten just the 'provisions' in all their veggie glory); salmon tartare; and that fantastically crunchy fried quinoa topping. Really, I can't even pick a second favorite... and I don't even want to try!  Every dish we ordered was a visual and gustatory treat: so innovative, so refreshing, and, most importantly, so delicious. And the service was top notch: gracious, never overbearing, and very personable. Plus, the plaid shirts, skinny jeans, and white aprons are just ridiculously cute. We had just seen Once the other night, and all the guys here reminded us of that adorable Dublin bloke, and I definitely felt myself falling slowly here. :-)  All in all, an amazing culinary experience, where every bite was a delight. I almost didn't want the night to end! Perhaps one day, I'll have the good fortune of coming back and dining here once more... fingers (and toes) crossed.",

Food was fresh, vibrant, innovative and delicious. Atmosphere was lively and energetic. Chefs and staff were hospitable and accommodating. Special thank you to Forrest for going above and beyond.   Recommend make a reservation or get there at 5:30, right when they open and get your name down on the wait list. Keep in mind the wait can be lengthy, we waited for 2 hours but man was it well worth the wait. In the mean time, go for a walk to the near by park or head over to Japan town and explore. I would suggest checking in every half hour and see if you can get in sooner than estimated, we were told 9:00 and were able to be seated at 8:00.   Next, try to get a table at the chef's counter, in the middle if possible so you can have the best seat in the house to see all the action in the kitchen. Another perk of the chef's counter is you get first dibs on whatever the kitchen is making.   My favorite dishes were the ones served hot more so than the cold dishes served from the dim sum cart. I would gladly go back for the Quail, Hamachi over a bed of homemade noir cracker, Rabbit, Pork Belly and for dessert the Cocoa Nib and Mint Granita.   I will definitely be back in the fall to see how they interpret the new seasonal products.   Overall Thoughts  The best restaurant I have been to since I moved to SF!",

    "review_text": "I didn't expect to go here this soon - the famous difficulty of getting a table put me off from trying this place. This place is obviously underpriced relative to the demand, and as long as SBP doesn't raise prices this means customers end up paying with their time (lining up at 5pm, staying up until 4am to try to get the reservation) in attempts to capture the excess consumer surplus. This isn't a game I like playing.  But as four of us were leaving a concert at the Fillmore around 10:30pm my buddy's girlfriend dropped in to see if they had room for a table of 4. They did and we decided this was a better alternative than late night korean.  They were closing soon so we didn't get the full psuedo-dim sum experience (We could order off of the menu but there were less dishes being moved around the restaurant). But the dishes they did come around with were all quite good. \u00a0In fact, if you are eating here I highly recommend making a meal of the appetizers. We tried about half of the dishes and none of the appetizers disappointed (except for the person who was here before who said that now the garlic bread and burrata is smaller than it used to be) and most were quite good. The hen dumpling soup was amazing as was the duck liver mousse.  The main dishes were slightly less impressive. When we ordered the smoke sturgeon everything pancake we imagined some sort of awesome twist on okonomiyaki. What it was ended up being basically a very thick pancake with some fish and greens on top. \u00a0The state bird wasn't bad but it wasn't that amazing either - it was just fried and almost anything fried can taste good. No one really disliked the cast iron quail egg dish, but no one really liked it either.  Dessert was a step up from the main courses - the peanut muscovado milk shot was very interesting and the oolong tea sandwich came in 4 pieces which made it really easy to split between four people.  The service was great the whole way through even though we were among the last people in the restaurant. \u00a0I'll probably be back, but it's not quite worth giving up my mid afternoon/evening to try to show up at the restaurant and get seated when they have room.",

    "review_text": "I admit that my expectations may have been too high. I REALLY wanted to like this spot. I had heard really great things about this spot from an acquaintance who worked at Saison and F+W plus a few people had mentioned the great reviews. I really tried to get there at 5:30 but ended up in traffic for an hour and half due to some stupid protest in Union Square and a couple accidents on the bridge. I was pretty famished by the time I got there. I really liked the concept and thought the service was perfect but the atmosphere and the food.... frankly, the both left much to be desired.   There is a little bar space where two people can stand up eating right by the front door. I was immediately super irritated by the idea but I was so hungry that I agreed to eat standing up by the door which of course opened a million times leaving me freezing. There is a section of the menu served dim sum style on carts and a section that is by order. I like this idea a lot.   At least for me, the service was absolutely perfect. Everyone was super friendly, quick and on top of things without being stuffy or overbearing in the slightest which is a big plus for me. The only shitty thing was I didn't end up being offered all the dim sum options and since there wasn't a list that I could see, I wasn't able to ask after the ones I wanted to try (like the oysters or the duck liver mousse or spicy tofu skin).  The food was such a bummer. Maybe I just went here on an off night?  Here is what I had:  +huckleberry beets with goat yogurt. One of the better dishes and also something I have had a million times often much better at many different spots.  -sweet corn, garlic chive and mt tam pancakes... I don't know what happened... how could I not like something where all the ingredients are things I hold so dear? I just wasn't into this... a little too soggy and had a weird bitter taste  +sea urchin pancake with ginger scallion and lime-soy. This was great. It was the only thing I genuinely enjoyed. I will probably go back just to eat this.  -steak tartare with grilled broccoli and shishito. I love steak tartare usually... \u00a0I only ate one bite of this  -guinea hen dumpling... super boring.   -shrimp, avocado and nori... again, all things I love... it was just bland and not very inspired.  -marinated yuba 'noodles'- this was probably my least favorite.   -quail with lemon onion provisions... I am so sad to say this was disappointing. I was most looking forward to this dish as I love quail. I felt that it was too heavily breaded and somehow in the cooking it really lost that sweet gaminess that I love about quail until it just tasted like badly friend chicken. greasy and oily not in a good way. The lemon preserves were decent but made the bottom of the quail soggy.  I wish I had tried the pork belly or the garlic bread with burrata. They looked good but I was stuffed.  I had the Japonais cheesecake for dessert (again 1 bite and I didn't want anymore....) then the strawberry granita with honey and tapioca.... I thought I would LOVE this and it was ok... it was my second favorite of the night.   I didn't like the decor and it was a bout a million decibels in there but I don't think the atmosphere matters that much, it should be about the service and the food. As I said, the service was great and it makes me feel all the more worse that I was so disappointed by the food. Maybe I will try this place again, but I it will be with a hesitant tongue. A few other people told me they had a similar experience. I hope it was just an off night and not that they really are super missing on the flavor profiles. there was just something off and weird or bland about everything for me. :( I didn't even like the iced tea or almond horchata that much.   With tip my bill was $125. I have no problem dropping a bill or three on a good meal but for such a disappointment I felt really ripped off. Super excited to super bummed. Boo.",

If we had been able to order for ourselves we would have been better able to order appropriate amount of some of the amazing dishes that we did truly enjoy. \u00a0Thus, some in our party were still a bit hungry when we left.   Second, we felt like we were consistently being rushed through our meal, even though we had to wait 5 months for our 5:30pm reservation on a Saturday. \u00a0There was no time between courses to sip our wine or chat before the next set of dishes were brought out.

They claim that they have a \"significant number of tables\" reserved every night for walk-in's. This is actually a lie. On two separate occasions I went in about 30 min after opening and asked if there were any time(s) left that night at all and the said they were completely full and when they heard I didn't have a reservation they rolled their eyes and scoffed at me.  Attitude aside, my bff managed to snag a resso super late one Friday night and I was pretty determined to come. We had a party of 4, and we were eager foodies so we decided to get pretty much *everything*.   The only dishes that were memorable were the fried green tomato and the ravioli / dumpling. Literally everything else was mediocre to subpar to downright not good. I was pretty shocked. The bone marrow was pretty terrible, not well done at all, and the bread was like spongy vinegar instead of sourdough.   Overall, I didn't like this place. Everything was also quite greasy, it was like they didn't know any other style of cooking except grease, butter and more grease. And apparently vinegar spongy sourdough.   If you had your hopes up for this place ... sorry don't be sad if you don't get a reservation.",

SO impressive!!!!  And now for the FOOD!!!!! Holy Moly!!! The food was ridiculous!!!! We tried just about everything that was passed around. Favorites of the evening: crudite of mini vegetables and soft goat cheese with sesame seeds &amp; cardamom, duck liver pate with almond cookies, glazed pork ribs with spigarello &amp; togarashi, and the coconut-ginger-cardamom baba with hachiya persimmon. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and tasted like the sea. There were just too many delicious options to sum them all up here!   The menu changes on a weekly basis so be ready to be surprised! Everything is fresh with a flavor profile that will knock you socks off.   It is a bit pricy, so bring three friends with you and split the bill! That way you can all try even more items off the carts and trays! Go...EAT!!!!",

    "review_text": "Phony as a two dollar bill. The owners problably thought \"oh, we're so tired of conventional restaurants, let's create something different, a whole new dining experience\". Even if they thought that, they failed. It's not that different: even in Panama City, in Central America, there is a restaurant (Manolo Caracol) that operates more or less along those lines for some seven years so far. And foodwise, they are comparable: nothing to write home about. But to get reservations to Manolo Caracol is easier than to State Bird Provisions - and that will always remain a mistery to me: the place isn't worth going - period. There are two good things about State Bird Provisions: it's not expensive and people who wait on tables are nice. And that is all.  The decor resembles that of a high school cafeteria; the wine list is pitiful (really) and the food is okayish at best - with the enphasis more on the \"ish\" than on the \"okay\". And the place is unbearably loud: you can't hear what the waiter tells you, you can't hear what people on your table say to you and, to make things worse, the restaurant has music playing, which nobody can pay any attention to, but adds up to the noise level. The loudest restaurant in the Bay Area. Going there is having an unpleasant experience in terms of noise, ambiance, decor, waiting time and finally get food that is more on the hype/fashionable/trying-to-be-something-different side, than on the good, tasty side. If you like to go to restaurants that everybody talks about, no matter the food you get there, than you will be rewarded at State Bird Provisions: it;s super-hype. But if you like to go to restaurants to enjoy a good ambiance, a nice setting and specially, good food, then go somewhere else. One star is even perhaps too much.",

Our server was actually the chef owner. \u00a0I didn't find out until the end of the evening. \u00a0I am always impressed with the food knowledge of servers in high end SF restaurants, but he really impressed me with his food knowledge and enthusiasm. \u00a0Someone who is so passionate about his business that he would actually get THAT close to the customer is really inspiring. \u00a0Obviously, the service was amazing!!!  I love state bird provisions because like Bar Agricole, Bar Bambino, Mission Chinses food, and a few other restaurants, it seems to stand out among the crowd. Every SF restaurant seems to have the same format and the same style of food. \u00a0I love cal cuisine, yummy salads, etc., but SF has about 100 of these restaurants. \u00a0 I like places in SF that try and branch out and be bold and different. \u00a0  State bird provisions has a very unique yet simple decor. \u00a0It has an open kitchen. \u00a0It has a dim sum style format. \u00a0And it also has standing chef's counter. \u00a0All of these things are very unique, fun, and a welcome edition to the SF food landscape. \u00a0The crowd is not Marina (which tends to be a bit yuppie), or Mission (which tends to be a bit hipster). \u00a0The crowd is just the right mix of normal urban food lovers.  The food is simply amazing.  The portions are small, but well priced. You get the opportunity to try many different flavor combinations without going broke or feeling cheated. \u00a0The food had was an ode to Korean, Swedish, Southern Chinese, Northern Chinese cuisine. \u00a0It also had very compelling Modern American/Italian/Cal influences as well.   Other people have made specific comments about the food, so I will defer to them.   If I had one negative about the restaurant, it is actually the unique format. \u00a0I like that it is unique, but dim sum format doesn't work for high end cuisine. \u00a0I think of food as an experience or a work of art. \u00a0One should contemplate and savor their food. \u00a0Pacing is very important to achieving these goals. \u00a0At a dim sum style, you see great food pass by and you just want to grab it. \u00a0Next thing you know, you have 5 amazing dishes on your table that demand attention. \u00a0You don't have time to really focus on the flavor combination of one dish because you have four others in front of you. \u00a0This is a minor gripe and can be easily fixed by exercising some restraint.   If you have been on the fence about this restaurant, it is time to take a risk and try something different!   I highly recommend this place.",

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions is a restaurant so hyped that like The French Laundry, people schedule trips to the Bay Area around their dinner reservations. After finally getting an opportunity to eat here with my beloved dining partner, is it worth the hype? Hell to the YES!   I had my eye on SBP long before my internship started, but I also knew how hard it would be to secure reservations due to some rather clever people and their code. Even if I was online at exactly midnight there would be *no* guarantee that I would get my ideal time, especially on a Friday evening. Knowing that the restaurant saves a third of their spots for walk-ins, the No1DP and I coordinated to meet at the restaurant at 4pm. Three people were in front of us (8 people total) but the No1DP and I were able to be seated come 5:30. Plus with the foodies waiting in line with us the wait didn't seem too bad as it was filled with great conversation. Being a huge proponent of making reservations, this is the only time where it's just less of a hassle to wait in line the day you want to go. If you don't get seated right away (or want a later time) you can always ask the host upon entering.  VENUE/SERVICE: The No1DP and I lucked out. We managed to secure a spot at the chef's counter that's perpendicular to where the chefs actually cook. Though it's not the best spot to watch and interact with the chefs, what more than made up for this was that we had our own personal waitress *and* bartender and that our seat was towards the back of the restaurant so there wouldn't be much traffic of people going in and out of the restaurant. Becca was one of the greatest waiters I've ever seen and we had so much fun talking to her as she poured our wines. She also made good wine suggestions as she observed what dishes were were ordering from the carts and menu.  CONCEPT: It's hard to put this in a category as the restaurant is so unique... It's Japanese-inspired American small dishes served dim-sum style. Even this sentence doesn't do this place justice as it's one of the few restaurants that you just have to go see for yourself.   PROVISIONS: The first part of the meal the dim sum carts will come around and you can \"choose your own adventure\". Prices are served in these cute wooden signs next to the dishes. After making your selection staff would then place a tick mark on the appropriate price point. All provisions are listed $3-$12. You can't go wrong with any choices here as most dishes here were executed perfectly and/or tasted so delicious.   Hog island oyster, spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame ($3) Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth ($3) Fuyu persimmon with kinako ($4) Quinoa-cauliflower 'tabouleh' with local nori ($6) Pork belly citrus salad ($12) Shrimp &amp; potato 'okonomiyaki' ($7) Garlic bread with burrata ($8) Tuna conserva 'chip &amp; dip' ($8) Smoked trout parfait with uni slaw ($10) Duck confit (forgot price)  This is what the No1DP and I got for provisions. If dining for only two half portions are offered on some items. As the provisions change frequently I won't even bother commenting on every dish but overall I think we chose the right dishes. Standouts include the dumpling (the chicken had the consistency of braised beef, No1DP and I asked for seconds), pork belly (so soft and tender!), trout parfait (good amount of smoked trout and light on the uni) and the \"okonomiyaki\" (a hot and fluffy potato with a delicious shrimp 'slaw'). Though my least favorite was the tuna dip, the only reason why this is so is because this was the most average dish and tasted like any other cooked tuna. A restaurant got two happy diners if we considered the worst dish only \"average\".   The second part of the meal consists of ordering things from the menu. These are the more \"permanent\" offerings. Ask a staff member and they'll bring it to your table. It is suggested to order at the minimum one from each category.   PANCAKES &amp; TOAST: Get one of each. Roasted squash &amp; gruy\u00e8re whole-grain pancake ($3/piece). Fluffy pancake that had an equal amount of squash and batter. Steak tartare sunchoke toast ($4/piece). Toast was crunchy and somewhat bitter but held together the steak.   COMMANDABLES: One of these should be the state bird (on the 7x7 \"Big Eat\" list) CA state bird with provisions ($9/half order). Deep fried (like the duck confit) but not heavy. LOVE the sauce underneath the quail. Dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg bottarga ($26). Very eggy noodles and had a strong ginger flavor.   DESSERTS: Get ice cream sandwich or milk. Szechuan pepper 'ice cream' sandwich, chocolate beer coulis, cashews ($8). Spice level is mild and has a good amount of chocolate, ice cream and cashews. The candied ginger makes this more tart.  As of this writing this is my favorite restaurant in SF and one of my top three foodie experiences (#1 is French Laundry, #3 is Lazy Bear for comparison).",

Out of thirteen dishes, those three are recommendable:  - Quinoa with cauliflower - Fried green tomatoes - Persimmon with sesame  The really disappointing \u00a0ones were:  - state bird with provisions: the coating was way too thick so that the meat could not be tasted at all - lamb dumplings: the dough of the dumpling was very thick and completely dominated the taste of the filling which - as a consequence - could hardly be tasted. It would be fairer to call it a lamb ravioli but also that name wouldnt make it any better - ice cream sandwich: the combination of sweet lemon icecream, super sweet chocolate cookie as a base and sweet meringue on top was just too much of sweetness - my taste buds were badly longing for a component which would compensate the overload of sweetness within this desert  The other dishes i tried were ok but at a quality which i would expect at any other restaurant as well.

    "review_text": "Stand-out meal in SF. \u00a0 The chefs were too cute to handle, and the entire experience was wonderful. \u00a0  We approached the logistics of getting a table straightforwardly: \u00a0the restaurant opens at 5:30pm, we arrived 45 minutes before and were about 20th in line. \u00a0A few people seemed to take the tactic of waiting on line as we did, and then putting their names down for a reservation later that evening. \u00a0We weren't sure if that was by choice, or if we were one of the last for the first round of seatings.  We were immensely lucky to have been seated at the bar, with a direct view of the chefs in action. \u00a0This is not only extremely entertaining, but offered a real benefit in viewing the dishes as they were made, before they were offered to the seated patrons. \u00a0Sometimes the chefs leaned over after completing a dish and offered them to us first.  The real challenge here is not over-ordering, or saying \"a thousand times yes!\" to the first dozen dishes that are presented to you. \u00a0  There is a regular menu, and every day they create and pass around new plates dim-sum style. \u00a0My suggestion would be to order 2-3 items that you absolutely must have from the regular menu, then try the ones that are passed around. \u00a0If you have not reached satisfaction after a few rounds, then you can always order from the regular menu as you go. \u00a0  We ordered the CA State Bird with provisions off their regular menu which is a small, delicately fried quail (California's state bird, without much irony). \u00a0It was flavorful and juicy, everything you'd want in fried quail (or any poultry), and it was with great restraint and to our benefit that we ordered the smaller portion.   One of my favorite dishes was a brothy concoction with a variety of mushrooms and herbs. \u00a0Sashimi bites served on thick, crispy seaweed was a favorite of ours. \u00a0  My friend was visibly upset when, just moments after declaring defeat and readiness for dessert, we were presented with pork belly. \u00a0My dear friend is incapable of saying no to pork belly, and I cannot disagree with her. \u00a0It was a good decision, even though the dish sat there for a good 15 minutes while we mustered up the courage and stomach space to enjoy it. \u00a0  Lack of restraint brings us to our dessert course, where yes, I insisted that we get both the black sesame ice cream sandwiches (with the peanut milk shot) and the olive oil cake. \u00a0No regrets here. \u00a0The ice cream sandwiches are somewhat of a marvel - if you like a traditional sundae I would skip this. This is far more \"modern\" if taste and texture, which is neither a good nor bad thing. \u00a0I like sesame and enjoyed the unique texture of the \"cookie\" part of the sandwich, it was light and almost meringue-like in texture. \u00a0Think chewy macaron. \u00a0The olive oil cake was a far more airy and light, with delightful rhubarb accompaniments. \u00a0  I didn't love all the dishes here - some of the seafood was less memorable and the steak tartare, the peacock of the dishes with the impressive red endive leaf, was not extremely flavorful.  This was one of the most fun I've had at a meal, and I will be back for my next SF visit.",

    "review_text": "Western fancy foodstuff served dim sum style. Yep, you heard me correctly. The concept of dim sum is actually a really strong one -- you are offered small portions of different dishes, freshly made from the kitchen, and if you like more of it you can always get more. It's just usually quite hard to realize for most places -- not to mention the amount of dirty dishes you'd generate ;)  SBP does it by offering a couple of staples on a small menu, and have daily specials that get transported out to tables via trays or carts. There are a good number of different dishes -- it's going to be tough for 2 people to try everything in one go. Service was fantastic -- definitely the part most different from a standard dim sum experience. It was rather interesting as the restaurant feels very SF-hipster, but there was no snarky or snobby attitude at all.  What we had: Hamachi with avocado puree on crispy seaweed. My absolute favourite dish of the meal. Lobster salad - meh. Oysters. Sauce was nice, but covered up taste of oyster. Roasted rabbit. Quite delicious, but rabbit was a bit tough. Beef tartare. Loved it, it wasn't very saucy or overwhelming, but felt rather light. State bird. This is one of the staples of the restaurant, always on the menu. The quail was very tender and delicious...makes me feel guilty now because I want to gobble up every quail out there. Cauliflower - decent, but could be done better.  And we capped it with dessert. The desserts were so delicious they almost overshadowed the main meal. We had the peanut butter milk shots (a must-try!!), ice cream sandwiches, and one more thing that I forgot. I want to say it's an apple thing, but it is in my tummy now!  I really want to come back again but reservations are hard to come by (at least they allow reservations...) Walk-ins can be a challenge if your stomach can't stand hunger for too long. I hope that I will have the chance to come here again in the near future.",

    "review_text": "After my visit to State Bird, I was a little confused as to what the hype is all about. Granted, the concept is unique- a dim sum-esque experience combined with trendy California-style cuisine.   My boyfriend and I started out a little too eager when they started coming around with the carts of beautifully plated food. We immediately said yes to the duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, but in my opinion, it was a huge mistake and a bad way to start out the meal. The duck flavor was really strong, and the almond biscuit paired with it just made the whole bite extremely heavy. Next, we had the shrimp croquette, which had Asian-style sauces and small bay shrimp. The croquette wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly different from other croquettes that I've had. The fried green tomato came around next, and it had a really good puree that came with it. Once again, nothing special though.   We continued to order off the menu, deciding to try some of their popular dishes. I liked the quail eggs in a skillet, especially the farro that added a good crunch. However, the state bird was a huge disappointment. The fried quail wasn't unique at all, and the portion was tiny. My favorite dish of the night was the duck fried rice. The flavor was great and the portions were generous. They added a lot of more unique ingredients that made me want to order another bowl.   We finished off the meal with the lemon curd ice cream sandwiches with chocolate macarons. This is definitely a must-try! The macaron outsides gave the sandwich an extra-chewy texture, and the lemon pairing contrasted the sweeter cookie.   I'm glad I finally got a chance to try State Bird, but I honestly wasn't impressed enough to want to come back again.",

    "review_text": "California fresh is not New York delicious. Good, not great. Lovely concept executed almost well. It seems as though their is 1 or 2 many staff in the front and back of house, just enough standing around with not enough seating to make it slow. I love a long dining experience but not at the expense of service or quality. The hostess was exceptional.   All the dishes seemed to be in that odd portion size of too small for 3 to share but too big for one which made the experience odd. My favorite way to eat is to try as many things as possible, when one bite is not enough but 4 is too many you're full before you had a chance to \"foodie\".   It's built as a deconstructed tasting menu without the level of service that environment should provide. Upscale casual doesn't have to feel like your being cheated out of a wonderful experience because it isn't as stuffy as higher rated places.   The food is borderline exceptional. Although, timing out of the kitchen was strange, lots to start, a really long wait, we had to ask when the menu items we ordered would arrive (about 30 minutes) since servers seemed to skip tables at times with the dim sum items. Good desserts.   Overall great concept just needs a little more sweat equity. Great potential with more refinement.",

The hamachi avocado seaweed is the best item on the menu by far. \u00a0One of these is meant for 3-4, but I ate one and a half by myself. \u00a0It is one of the best dishes I've ever tried, and if I had a reservation here, I'd come back just for that. \u00a0The quail was decent, though a far second to the seaweed. \u00a0Everything else was kind of funky (also tried the uni pancake, bone marrow, allagash black, rabbit croquette, pork belly salad). \u00a0Among the dessert, the peanut muscovado milk shots were my favorite, while the ICS and caramel tart were decent.",

    "review_text": "EXTRODINARY!! Yes I dared to do a walk in with no reservation, on a Saturday, after heeding the advice of the reservationist on HOW to get in without waiting weeks or getting a 1030 crappy reso. Nicole, the reservationist said the best bet is to show up before opening at 6pm and most likely I will get a table at one of the tables they keep for walk ins.   We get there at 545 with 7 pl in line. I quickly hopped out of the car while the hubby fought for parking in Jtown, while I braved the freezing cold and torential wind chill to get some (hopefully yummy food) and waited amongst other foodies in line.  The door promptly opens at 6pm and the entire line rushes in, orderly, but obviously anxious to see if they can get a table.   The couples in front of me were able to score tables, and then they cut it off at US! NOOOOOOO....  The hostess kindly told us it would be a 90 minute wait, OR we could take one of the 4 \"stand up\" only tables at the kitchen/bar. Basically they have 4 placesettings in a bar like area in the entrance to the restaurant that faces the open kitchen. \u00a0No seats..We walked over, and thought it was abit akward but hey what the heck we got in!!  Unbeknownst to us, this was the best decision ever.....not only did we get first dibs on the carts coming out, we got to see everything the cooks and sous chefs were making, plating, etc. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY Chef Stuart Brioza YES FORMER RUBICON CHEF himself served us!! \u00a0   That was such a special treat and he was the most polite and took his time (with a packed house) to explain to us the menu and the house specialties.  we were so excited to be able to talk to chef himself about each dish, and he was equally excited to talk to us about all of his creations. Since we were eating practically in the kitchen, we got to see them plate everything and put it onto the dim sum cart before it rolled out to the main dining room. As we were eating, i told the hubby this is the best seat in teh house!! the main dining room, albiet nice, but it was small and DARK. I wouldnt have had such a good time eating there really as you can barely see the food and just being in that open air kitchen and seeing them cook and then serve you was just so special and unique!  Almost everything we had was very, very good, and each dish was special and creative in its own way. All the flavors in each dish was uniqe, and this is very hard to do when you have so many small dishes on the menu. We basically had all the must eats on the menu, and were stuffed.   we had:  Oysters on half shell- really fresh kumamotos wiht house made vinegrette. at $2 a pop so worth it!  Steelhead caviar chip n dip- chef said they cure it in house and make everything fresh. This was my favorite. The steelhead caviar had a nice pop to it and not overly salty at all. IT was perfect and I could eat this all day long!  Fluke tartare, quinoa, with bonito rosemary aioli-this dish was refreshing and interesting. Between the bites of the raw fish, ,the toasted crunchy quinoa and the aioli, you had a mix of textures in your mouth. It was like a party in your mouth!  Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- oh so good. SO GOOD. YUM. THey make the mousse in house \u00a0and also have a pastry chef making the little biscuits. Mousse wasnt too salty or overpowering while the hint of sweetness in the biscuit complimented it so nicely. The biscuit was more like a cake like thing. I could eat them all day too!  Pickle plate- beef tongue, potato and veg pickles- oh man this dish was very tasty and interesting. They pickle the beef tongue in house, so tender and flavorful, with the slightest pickled taste. The veggies -carrots, potatoes were also pickled and oh so good. This was probably my 2nd fav dish.   Green garlic bread with burratta- Anything burrata I do love. I saw the pasty chef making the green garlic bread fresh. It looks like a pretzel, they fry it, then pile up some fresh burrata on top. Great hung over snack!  Ca State bird with provisions- basically the deep fried quail. I was talking to sous chef and we saw him making this dish and he said it was their specialty. We tried to find out what mixture he used to fry it with- something with flour, ground up pistachios and some other things. It was light, crispy, flavorful, and very tender and moist.-- did I mention he was also cute??!! We admired the rest of the night all of his fabulous creations like two little food groupies on crack.  Beef cheek salad, radishes and bone marrow- I had high expectations for this considering it said \"bone marrow\". The presentation is great, and chef comes by to pour you the dressing out of a little ceramic thing that looks like bone marrow. The beef cheeks were cooked perfectly while the greens gave it a nice texture. I was expecting more flavor, the hubby loved it.  Milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine cocoa jam- were stuffed but chef convinced us otherwise!  duck neck dumplings/ sauerjus-soo good. DO IT!!  Cant wait to go back!",

This is where you check in. We were seated very promptly. \u00a0  We started with several items of the passed trays: Matsutake mashed potatoes with goat cheese Chantrelles with butternut squash and farro Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits Vinegar glazed smoked potato with tonnato Shrimp, avocado, nori Garlic bread with buratta  We also ordered a couple of items off of the menu. \u00a0  Smoked sturgeon, horseradish schmear with an everything pancake State bird with provisions kiwi-moscato granita with persimmons, pomegranate and tapioca peanut milk  Nothing was a total miss, which is impressive. \u00a0The matsutake mashed potatoes were wonderful, and the guinea hen dumpling was really stellar. \u00a0The fried garlic bread with buratta is one of my favorite dishes. So straight forward, and amazing. \u00a0I can't currently eat the duck liver mousse, but my husband was sent to some kind of happy place as he ate it. \u00a0The shrimp with avocado and fried nori was excellent as well with a great balance of textures and flavors. \u00a0The smoked sturgeon was lightly smoked, and the pickled onions on the dish made it really pop. \u00a0Of course the signature dish was excellent. \u00a0If every fried fowl had this kind of crispness, I would be the fattest person on the planet. \u00a0Each dish hit a high point on some element. \u00a0The food was tasty, playful, and satisfying without being so filling that you couldn't continue trying other tastes and textures.  The biggest pain about the place is getting a reservation. \u00a0Check midday to see what has opened up, an note, a late reservation doesn't necessarily mean you'll be there until midnight. We got a 9:30 reservation, and without feeling rushed, I think we were done by 11. This place currently has a HUGE buzz. That's what you get for getting write ups in both Bon Appetit and Food and Wine. \u00a0I'll be back, but maybe after the buzz has settled down a touch.",

State Bird Provisions is the ONLY restaurant in SF that 1) I will wait 60 days to dine at; 2) Continually surprises me with their menu updates; 3) Continually impresses me with their regular dishes; and 4) excites me nowadays.   I've been RAVING about this restaurant to all my friends. On the two occasions that I've brought friends with me to this restaurant, they agreed that the restaurant lived up to the hype!   After my three visits, here's what I recommend:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -Any pancake/short stack: I've tried corn, duck, and uni, and their savory pancake combinations are always a winner.  -Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: essentially, naughty cupcakes for adults. Perfectly sweet almond/corn biscuits smothered in a decadent, luxurious duck liver mousse that harkens back to the days of foie gras.  -Garlic knots with burrata: Simple knotted breads, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside, smothered with silky, pillowy burrata.  -Anything with pork belly: I've tried several versions of pork belly at SBP. All are usually Vietnamese style, and all delicious.  -CA state bird with provisions: perfectly breaded/crunchy outside and juicy quail inside, served on top of lemony stewed onions. Small, but packs a punch and well worth the price.  -Any and all desserts: especially the ice cream sandwiches  OK, BUT NOT TERRIBLE (just not \"must try/must order\") -charred octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa -tombo tuna-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker -1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, sunchoke &amp; ravigote  -duck neck dumplings: SBP is well known for this, but I've had enough dim sum in SF to not be impressed by their version  -oysters: interesting, but i'm a purist and I prefer Hog Island for oysters   A fun place to eat New American cuisine and the dim sum/tapas style dining makes it a fun place to eat with friends. Here's hoping that SBP keeps up the good work! I LOVE this place!",

And any place worth reviewing always has something like 863 Yelp reviews so it's seriously easy to skip writing one.  First, the dim sum concept is brilliant. The problem with tapas is that I always feel ripped off, even at fine places like Bocadillos or Ramblas/Locanda. You don't know what you're going to get, and you spend a small fortune to get your fill. But here you get to see the plate and its price, and hear its description before you take it. It is a perfect solution. It helped that the prices were very reasonable.  Second, the execution was great as well. The service was friendly and attentive, and the dishes inventive and tasty.  I didn't take notes, but my favorites were the kimchi pork belly clam stew, flatbread with ox tail, and duck prosciutto with dried persimmons. Also excellent: quinoa, marinated mushrooms, and goat cheese with vegetable crudite. The radicchio beet salad reminded me of cole slaw -- not necessarily a bad thing, but did not do justice to the fresh beets. And I thought, exactly as another reviewer remarked, that the sourdough pancakes from the menu were doughy and undercooked.  I'm sorry I missed the fried quail and will certainly return to try it.",

    "review_text": "I'm a big fan of tapas and State Bird Provisions definitely hit the spot. Tapas, in general, are pricey bites to eat, and State Bird Provisions is no exception. \u00a0However, the novelty, freshness, and quality of the tapas dishes are top notch here. \u00a0As many have remarked, it's like dimsum with a western/American twist. Many of the dishes make use of local ingredients and incorporate elements from different cuisines--mainly from Asian cuisines. \u00a0  My friend and I shared about 9 dishes-- our favorites being the pork belly in Vietnamese broth, the garlic bread, hamachi atop nori chip, uni scallion pancake, and the bone marrow. \u00a0All the food was prepared exceptionally well, seasoned just right, and was just mouthwatering good! \u00a0  One of the awesome things I found out about this place after eating here is that it has one Michelin star. Typically Michelin star restaurants tend to be kind of pricey, but State Bird Provisions is an affordable restaurant for those who want to try a Michelin restaurant without too big of a dent in your wallet. \u00a0Overall a good experience with good food-- 4 stars!",

Luckily, he called to find out that people who have reservations do not need to stand in that ridiculous line to get in. Once we were in, the magic starts.  We got the nectarine and the spiced cherry soda. The nectarine was better. The corn pancakes were to die for, esp w/ the tasty Mt. Tam cheese on top. The state bird w/ provisions was good, but not good enough for us to order 1 full bird. Only 1/2 a bird next time. There was a smoked trout and chips dish on the seafood cart that was absolutely divine. And a salmon ceviche dish that was so tasty. We started to realize the dim sum serving style was great but we were overordering!  I'm glad we got to try everything we wanted to. There were definitely some dishes I wouldn't get again. But that's not because they were bad. It's because I'll save my stomach for the other spectacular dishes.   The service was also great and very attentive!  The only negative thing is that we had to literally wait on the internet 2 mins before midnight to make reservations. I'm glad we were able to snatch up a reservation! Totally worth it!",

Ignoring the cool 'dim sum' system of choosing food, \u00a0the unpretentious surroundings and attentive but unfussy service - and concentrating on the food....   The food here is fun and different. Interesting but uncomplicated small plates of flavorful California cuisine with a definite Asian influence. There are dishes here that I haven't tasted elsewhere, and they mix up the 'dim sum' dishes on a regular basis. \u00a0That's not to say every dish is a 'hit' but best dishes are absolutely outstanding, and at a non 'fine dining' price point. As I mentioned the food isn't revolutionary.. but has the same extreme emphasis on ingredients and taste as you'll find at Frances. Of course, it's difficult to get a reservation - but go now before they get their first Michelin star and it becomes impossible to get a table within three months!",

Obviously I had to try so I'd have something to write home about. \"Dear New York....\"  Did a walk in and got blessed with the Walk-in Karma. Hostess is WAY COOL.   Anyway... some dishes were good, not freakazoid OmFGGGggggg but good, cool. Like, I enjoyed it going down my throat and I smiled. or Like when you get a compliment for wearing something that you weren't even trying with. I'll take it!   Some dishes were... hmm... trying too hard? Mixing up all these flavors that if I were a judge on Top Chef I'd wince and ask, \"why did you do that?\"  We got a lot of dishes. They all started to bleed into one another. I have a favorite from the night: Curried Scallop &amp; Avocado With Crunchy Quinoa  I expected more for the buttermilk quail. I'm a southern girl at heart so I know my fried chicken (or [insert bird]) and the batter was not that tasty.  I know some ppl will say oh well the dishes change daily so maybe it was an off night. No, I pretty much think overall it's going to be the same range of \"goodness\", or else what you're telling me is this place is inconsistent?   Value-- overpriced for what you get. I've had better for cheaper. I wasn't fulfilled. Just don't get your hopes up. OR of course, maybe I just have bad taste in food.  I wouldn't go back but I did very much enjoy: 1) atmosphere- so \"cool\" to feel as if I apparently made it to an Oscar's party. 2) all the sexy tattoos on the waiters' arms.  3) concept- dim sum without the chicken feet  Tip: Don't sweat it if you haven't gone here.   Tip 2: Guys, maybe you should bring dates here. They'll be impressed I'm sure either way-- that you got an rsvp, or your creativity in picking a restaurant with a cool concept, or because you footed the bill! =) Get it!!!",

Everyone working there acts as your server. Everyone knows the dishes inside and out. The woman who sat us, Candace was a total sweetheart. Since it was our first time in she was sure to bring us whatever the \"must-have\" dishes were. And boy was she right!   Jason was our actual server and he was very on top of his game. Super nice and again, very informative about the food and portion sizes. We brought along our own bottle of wine and they were perfectly okay with that ($20 corkage).   We of course tried their famous dish, state birth with provisions. We had the half size, which was great for sharing between the 2 of us. Perfectly cooked with a balanced citrus sauce and shaved parmesan; the meat fell off the bone so easily.  Another one of my favorites was a burrata dish with a puff pastry and shaved parmesan and cracked pepper. So simple, yet so delicious. And they are not shy with the burrata!   We also had a lamb sweetbread dish with a fig and cherry chutney. A small dish as there was only two balls, but so good! The flavors are strong and can really stand on their own in the dish.   We also had a pork and tofu kimchi, which was amazing. They make all their kimchi in house.   I wish I could remember all the dishes we had, I'll add them as I remember. Plus pictures to come!",

We hadn't eaten since our 11:00 AM brunch that morning so we were primed for a great meal. \u00a0However, we ended up getting a SPECTACULAR meal that left us totally speechless and blissed out.  1.

Fried eggplant fries topped with chopped sweet tomatoes and a lovely vinaigrette. \u00a0The best eggplant dish I've ever had. \u00a0Mopped up the leftover sauce with the above garlic bread. 3. Steak tartare on top of a porcini aioli sauce with fried potato chips. \u00a0One of those \"I only get once this in a while\" indulgences - phew! \u00a0Glorious. . . 4. Cumin Lamb with figs, zucchini, pea vines and green onions. \u00a0Thinly sliced perfectly seasoned Willamette lamb (sliced off the shank). \u00a0Our fabulous server Megan said it was her favorite so we had to order it. \u00a0It rocked our world. 5.

Apricot \u00a0&amp; Vanilla Ice cream sandwiches (the almond meal cookie has the toothiness and texture of french macaroons) - pure summer sinful yummy-ness.  My BFF and I had such an amazing meal that we would burst into fits of laughter and giddiness from the food buzz we were experiencing. \u00a0We were completely besotted by the care/love put into each dish and inspired flavors.

I am tired of over hyped, rude, hipster driven places in san francisco where people don't have a clue about good customer service and good food. They are so caught up in their fancy, unpronounceable ingredients which they are so utterly clueless about and have forgotten the basics.  In any case, it's worth a visit if you have a reservation and want to see a new, gimmicky place but please be prepared for rude, customer service. Our waiter just appeared to be grumpy from the moment we sat down and we honestly felt talked down to. He didn't have any time for us or maybe he was just overworked. Plus we waited and waited for the magical 15 dishes that were not on the menu to appear dimsum style. Only half of them did in the 2 hrs we were there and we were made to feel like it was our mistake to arrive when we did (i. e. our reservation time) because apparently we had missed a lot of the dishes from the previous batch.  They kept asking us repeatedly if we wanted to order from the menu or if we were waiting for more savory dishes. Seriously annoying.  After a good 30-40 minute gap with no new dimsum dishes we asked for the check and our waiter turned completely cold. We couldn't believe it. Clearly we didn't eat enough food or spend enough money for him and his attitude was shocking. It just left us with a bad taste in our mouth walking out of the restaurant.  Now the food. Nothing was mind blowing. Only memorable dishes were the smoked trout and everything bagel pancake, the ricotta dumpling with pumpkin sauce, the fried quail eggs and so some extent the name sake dish though it was a bit greasy and not as crispy.  Nothing besides the ricotta dumpling above from the dimsum cart was worth it. We ordered 6 different things out of desperation waiting for food.  My husband and his dad weren't impressed with the steak tartare salad and his dad lives in France. The quinoa and the vegetable dish was completely forgettable, in fact I wish I could forget them.",

    "review_text": "As my girlfriend most eloquently put it, the way this place runs is kind of like a \"Create your own tasting menu\" joint. Sure, it's like a dim sum place, but the similarities stop with the carts and trays rotating around for your pickings. With that in mind, you should be prepared to pay as much as you would for a prixe fixe at a place that offers it. My gf and I spent about $60 each, and came away more than stuffed.  We tried about 6 or 7 things, but here are some of the high (and low) lights:  * The State Bird Provisions (i.e. breaded fried quail) was delicious. I was expecting some gaminess to be there, but was pleasantly surprised at how little gaminess there actually was. The breading was crispy and savory. Finger licking good.  * Oxtail Curry - To be honest, this was kind of a disappointment. On one hand, the flavor was off the charts. I could eat that sauce all day everyday. Where this dish really felt short was the oxtail itself. I felt like it didn't have enough time to be completely tenderized. It was a little chewy, and as a result was a little difficult to eat.  * Toast with Lardo Butter and Chicharron - I love all these things individually, so I couldn't say no when the cart came around. It sounded great in my mind, but in application I didn't see any cohesion there. I didn't think the flavors went well together here.  * Cast-Iron Eggs - Although it was pretty rustic, this was a nice dish. I thought the egg was cooked beautifully and its richness really brought everything together. Really tasty.  Overall, I think this is a great place to hang out and enjoy some pretty tasty food. The dim sum style service is fun, especially since the folks coming around with the food can be easily understood, aren't rude and are happy to tell you all the ingredients in the dish. Although every dish I had wasn't a home run, I'm still really interested in coming back. I think this would be a perfect spot to eat and drink before heading to the Kabuki for a movie.  If you're a beer snob, you'll also like this place because they have a small but delicious selection of craft beers.",

It is interesting to have potato chips with fish eggs. I like the duck mouse, but I liked it better with the potato chips instead of the almond cakes. The oyster was excellent, and the grapefruit granita was really refreshing. The two vegetarian dishes were descents for carnivals.

    "review_text": "I have been wanting to try SBP for FOREVER and finally got a reservation (albeit 9pm!). You can also opt to get there early (think 4:30-5pm) to que for a walk-in spot.   The dishes come out \"dim sum\" style aka they bring small plates of food to your table and you select what you want. They also have a menu for larger plates that you can order on top of what small plates are floating around.   I recommend the State Bird (fried quail). So delicious and crispy! The menu changes so you can't get the same things but I did really enjoy the smoked trout- avocado 'chip &amp; dip' as well as the guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth. I think my least favorite was the garlic bread with burrata (too much bread, not enough flavor).  Overall, an excellent dining experience and would definitely would like to come back again.",

    "review_text": "The food here is excellent but in my opinion it's way overhyped. I can think of many meals that I've enjoyed more where I didn't not have to make a reservation three months in advance. That being said, if you have a chance to go here, it's well worth it, but I don't think it's worth queuing at 4PM for a reservation many hours later or getting up at 4AM to make a reservation three months in advance.  The food was very good, and everything is small bites. I mean small bites. The service (with maybe the exception of the host) was excellent. I really enjoyed the dim sum style of serving. You got to try many things and explore many different flavorts.  The main reason SBP does not get 5 stars is a couple things. First, while I'm sure the host was very busy, he told us that they were running behind and if we'd like to order drinks he'll bring them to us. We tried to order drinks several times but we could never get his attention, and the waiting area is not large. Additionally, we had 9:30 reservations and we were not seated until 10:00. Probably a symptom of the dim sum style of serving so you can never really judge how long a party will be, but 30 minutes is a bit excessive time to wait.   My last complaint is their wine list. It's pretty common knowledge that 1 bottle of wine = 4 glasses of wine, but their bottles of wine are priced at 5 times a glass. There's absolutely no reason to buy a bottle of wine there. We ended up getting wines by the glass so everyone could just order what they wanted to drink.",

Luckily, the kind folks at State Bird Provisions are awesomely nice and let me stash my bike in their storage hallway while we dined. What a wonderful first impression!  Then, from start to finish it just kept getting better and better! The service was amazing - everyone we encountered was engaging, funny, generous, and knowledgeable about the food and wine. And the food itself, mmmm... we had a few items from the set menu, and then enjoyed picking several of the dim sum style goings arounds, and all were wonderful. The worst dish we had was good, and the best was incredible.   And everything was reasonably priced and in a cool atmosphere. I hope to support this place by visiting again soon, and telling my friends!   Highly recommended!",

    "review_text": "I was so lucky to score seats to such a highly rated restaurant! Reservations are done months in advance (thanks to my boyfriend's brother) and it makes the whole seating process a lot quicker. Without reservations, you would have to wait outside as if you were at Disneyland waiting to ride Splash Mountain. A section of their seating is reserved for walk-ins, and as long as you line up at least an hour before they open (yes, there is already a small line outside by 3:30pm... and they open at 5:30pm), you can get seats. Also, this isn't the place for large groups. I don't recommend you to bring your kids neither. I would say parties of 4 at max. Better yet, go with 2. Perfect date setting.  The d\u00e9cor is extremely plain but yet also nice at the same time. Maybe its because of the lighting? But the walls are just one of those plain walls with holes that you can place hooks on them \u00a0(sorry for the lack of vocab). The place is pretty spacious, despite a packed house, with servers running around with trays or carts of small dishes. The servers would come around and explain everything in the dish, giving you a few moments to decide before moving on. They also list a price on a little stand so you can definitely decide if you want to take the dish or not.   The quality of the food was phenomenal, and everything was really delicious. Pricing was more on the expensive side. I mean it is good food but the portion was small, but then enough to share. There are 12 items that are served around by the servers, and the rest are on the menus. We didn't get all 12 dishes though.   Where to begin with the food? It's tough, as everything was good! Let's start with what I really liked.  -- Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame: I love the fact that it was not too large like Boiling Crabs. Sounds crazy right? But I enjoy eating smaller size because it lets you enjoy more of other flavors rather than a chunk of blob. The flavors mixed so well together where you can't taste the fishiness. They were fresh as well.   -- Steak tartar with jimmy nardello ranch - Really delicious and I didn't realized that I was eating raw beef because I thought it was tuna or something, until my boyfriend told me. The entire dish was well put together.  -- Salmon tartar with pickled turnips - A better choice for tartar over the steak version if you don't want to eat raw beef. This tasted a lot lighter and this time you can tell that it is seafood, not beef haha.I guess its more on the normal side of eating something raw.  --Ca State Bird: This tasted soooooo good! The cheese and onions went so well together with this and I just gobbled the whole thing down. The smell was great and the taste was even better! My boyfriend's mom keeps putting onions on my bird but turns out it was cheese and I felt so fat after eating it lol  -- Corn &amp; quinoa 'tabouleh' -A really fresh dish that looked super healthy. The flavor and satisfaction was all there for me. I can eat quinoa every day! -- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - (not my favorite, but it is my boyfriend's brother) I only like the biscuit because the duck liver was too overpowering for me. This was one of our first dishes, and we were left wanting more after finishing every last bit of it (well they boys wanted more of everything.. I just wanted the biscuits)  -- Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms &amp; pink peppercorn: For people who like bone marrow, this is for you. The flavor was a little too rich for me but still tasteful. The size was just right for 3-4 people to share, unless you really like bone marrows and you want the whole thing to yourself...feel free.  --Garlic Bread With Burrata: I'm sorry, but this was the only meal that was gonna bleh to me. It tasted way too cheesy and garlicy for me that I totally lost my taste. I only took one bite and I was done.  Dessert -- Birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries - A great end to an excellent meal! The chocolate crunch was really light. I wanted more after each bite. The biscuit was so deliciously moist and soft. The cloud cream was so fluffy and cold. I love how it was served on a random piece of wood. -- Green tea granita with ginger-vanilla tapioca &amp; roasted strawberries- It has an icy/ slushie taste, which was really nice as well. Nothing too special about this but it was very light and refreshing.  For the amount of food we ordered, we could have easily paid a lot more than what was on our bill. Our bill came out to be a little under $200 for 4 people. The food was really enjoyable and quite memorable. Dining at State Bird Provisions is an experience, and it definitely lives up to all the high reviews. I just reserved another time for me and my brother!",

    "review_text": "This is a hipster joint.   the food is good, but the food is disjointed and shares a similar fate IMHO to plum in oakland. everything has a vinegar or pickle component that just makes everything one note.  I think the dim sum style eating choices is a bad idea. we tried about 15 dishes in total and there was no flow to the meal.  we had the following items in this order  1.garlic cheese bread - we got this because the lady said its the last one and we should get it cause its good, well its not good. it was stale and had a clump of soft cheese on top with pepper. what really ticked me off was that 10 min later they made a fresh batch of it. im sure if i had known it would be passed around again i would have waited  2. rabbit meatballs - these were filled with cheese and had a creamy tomato sauce. just meh, it was over cooked and usually with rabbit you want to add some sort of fat cause its so lean, nope not here. the meatball reminded me of a cheese stuffed meatball i got at applebees.  3. oyster - the oyster was good, it was fresh and expertly shucked. the only issue with the oyster was the sauce it came with. pickled salad of radish. its hard to beat an oyster with lemon and tabasco. this one did not  4.sashimi - this was by far the best dish. it was sashimi of white fish with wasabi and various other ingredients served on a blue nori plate. this is where i have an issue with flow. this dish was balanced and delicate and should have been served first. unfortunately it was served in the middle of fatty overpowering vinegar/pickled dishes that muted the subtle flavor combination. if this dish was served to me first i probally would have given this place another start based on this alone.  ** at this point (15m into our meal) we decided to place an order from the menu we ordered the grilled beef and corn pancakes  5. ricotta dumpling - this was horrid. so bland could have used some salt and the mushrooms tasted like canned. i almost spit the mushrooms out but decided to swallow as i was sitting directly in front of the chef who made them and she was watching for my approval.  6. cured lemon dumpling - just ok but for 6 bucks for one dumpling i wanted better  7. pork belly - this would have been the state birds saving grace. It was crispy pork belly with Asian cilantro jalape\u00f1o salad with peaches the flavor combination is great and it has the wow factor that foodies love when trying a new dish in fact I would go back just for this. My issue is with the dim sum format you see I was watching them make it and was salivating for my opportunity to get the first \"dibs\" on it, but they \u00a0skipped right passed me and I got the last dish on its way back when it was no longer crispy and the salad wilted. Such a shame cause this dish could have been the difference between the 2 stars im giving it and 4 stars it could have earned  ** another update, at this point im watching them make the beef and pancakes and i see that this might be more of the same potentially amazing food that i got a glimpse of with the pork belly. the chef finishes and plates my dishes and tells the server where its destiny lies, the the server mistakenly brings it to the couple sitting next to me. arggggh  8. kim chi salad - this was good. very asian flavors as expected, had smoked egg on it and i liked it  9. duck liver mousse - this was the weakest dish by far it was almond cake like cookies with a alcohol tasting mousse. the cakes taste like desert and the mouse which had a great texture was overpowered by the port that it was infused with  10. squid salad - great taste but sadly over cooked, was like seafood chewing gum  **10 at this point i see that my beef and pancakes have been made and served to other people that ordered after me. and im not happy about it, but im starting to think it was a happy accident cause im pretty full. we grab a waitress and inform her to cancel the two orders but instead she insists that the items being made currently are earmarked for us and its too late.  11. grilled beef - this was a major disappointment, the beef was expertly cooked to a medium \u00a0 doneness but again covered in vinegar. i just dont get it, if i want vinegar flavor ill order a salad, if i order beef i want beef flavor  12. corn pancakes - just plain corn pancakes. not great, just standard  dished 13, 14, and 15 were dishes that they pretty much guilted me into getting. sometimes the chef said that he made it for us cause he thought we would like it, sometimes they said the dish is the best and will not be made again tonight. whatever the reason every time we got guilted into taking one we were disappointed.  my final recommendation would be to by all means check this place out, but its not anywhere near the level of food that people are reviewing as such.  save your money and you can get many of the same flavors at your local highly rated cheap Chinese/vietnamese/asian restaurant",

Some people brought a portable chair. I will definitely come back with a chair, so my wait will be more pleasant. When the store open, there were 58 people on the line. Although, they said it's a dimsum style, it's a bit different. Servers bring a tray has multiple plates of one item and offer it around tables. It's a bit of surprise, because I have no idea what would come next.(In a dimsum place, I know what's coming on the tray.) It's a fun concept and everything was absolutely delicious. I read some review pointed that this place is really loud, but that's not true. It seems like they updated ceiling that would absorb the noise better.",

    "review_text": "SBP has inventive and really outstanding food -- best if you have a more sophisticated palate to truly appreciate and because they can get a bit experimental (I wasn't a fan of the crunchy fried quinoa but \"got\" everything else) -- but its tasty for anyone. Cosy, eclectic warm decor, staff is spot on -- I would call them hyper aware and closely listening. Friendly but honest and genuine.   Recommend going with 4+ people so you can try more dishes. It's tapas/dim sum servings and they have roughly 12-15 revolving items serving each night -- with 4-6 people, you can try all the dishes + save room for a couple of desserts. That said, it's a small place and getting 6 people in if you don't have a reservation is tough. Bathroom was spotless.   Recommend any of the tartares, the gruyere chessy puff thing (forgot the official name), the quail eggs were light and tasty, whimsical., duck liver moose was crazy good. Kobe steak was highly seasoned but somehow did not overwhelm the thin slices of meat and pork belly was just yum. Everything is *fresh* and seasonal appropriate, which is better for you in terms of nutrients and better for the environment. And you must try the tea, particularly the herbal teas -- made with fresh real herbs in a clear pot -- pretty and delicious.",

Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms and pink peppercorn: My favorite dish of the night! Plenty of marrow and mushrooms. Perfectly roasted!  CA state bird with provisions: This was perfectly fried and crispy on the outside while still nice and moist on the inside. Sooo good!  Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: Yum! I love liver and this one didn't disappoint. Nice and creamy with that delectable liver flavor.  Grilled asparagus, preserved lemon-green garlic aioli: I love asparagus and this was grilled nicely.  Garlic bread with burrata: I love garlic bread and I love burrata. I just wished that the bread could have been a little more garlicky. Couldn't really taste it with all the burrata on top.  Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame: Oysters were overpowered by the spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame. I wanted to enjoy some of the sweet oceany taste of the oysters.   Pork belly blood orange salad: The pork belly was cooked to the point where it crumbled in my mouth. If not for that I would have enjoyed this dish.  Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth: Overwhelming taste of fish sauce in the broth.  Steak tartare caesar lettuce cups: Caesar dressing was a little overpowering. The steak flavor didn't really come through. I would have actually preferred this with tuna.  Wild king salmon tartare with fermented turnips: My least favorite dish. The salmon tartare was chopped to a point where the texture was just mushy.  Unfortunately this is what happens when a place is hyped up. I'm expecting the place to be amazing! Especially when it's so hard to get a reservation. I adored the bone marrow, state bird and duck liver, but everything else was just okay or seemed to have a combination of ingredients that didn't quite mesh, so 3 stars for the food. Since our server was so sweet, I bumped it up to 3.5.",

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a WOW dish here.  *duck liver mousse with almond biscuit $5 (2 of 5) Not complimentary to my taste buds. I was really surprised this savory and sweet combo was a failure. Each component was great. Duck liver was smooth and light. Almond was light and delicate. But when I ate it together, I didn't like it. *kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams $8 (3 of 5) I expected a more savory taste from the pork belly or a seafood blast from clams, but neither tastes shined. This small pot of goodies was quite mellow. In fact, I think stewing the contents with the kimchi vegetable chemically made it more bland. *sm. duck, celery root &amp; date salad $6 (3 of 5) Smoke Duck was savory and tasted like strong piece of ham. But I didn't favor too highly with the date pairing. I guess I am just not a dates kind of person. Again, sweet and savory, but not to my liking. *CA state bird with provisions quail (3 of 5) Was like skinny version of buttermilk chicken. Tasty, but not very filling. Delicate dish, but a lot of work, for very little meat. *glazed pork ribs with spigarello &amp; togarashi $10 (3 of 5) It was ok.  I really wanted to like this place more.

When it was our turn to check in, they said we could get a table around 7:30 and got our phone number in case it was sooner. We headed to a wine bar nearby and had a drink while we waited. They called us at 7:00 and said 10 minutes.. That gave us time to pay and walk back. We got seated right away and started the feast. I am not sure if I'll remember everything but here are the highlights: Beets with smoked trout cream:  Some creme fraiche with slightly smoked fish roe served on potato chips.  Beef tongue Oysters (served by piece) duck liver mousse with mini almond muffins crab with kimchee yuba scallion pancakes with uni. state bird with provisions (fried quail) coffee ice cream sandwiches.

    "review_text": "We lined up on a Monday night at 4:40, and were at the hat shop next door. We were able to get first round seating cause some in front came to reserve later tables. Excellent! There were few more tables empty still so I would say the hat shop is your safety point.   All you need to know is that in Chinese dim sum, avoid the filler foods. And same goes for this American dim sum. Don't jump at the first trays thrown at you. Order the classics. It's American food done well, in small shareable portions. They really like to play on texture and grains here and nothing's greasy on the menu.   We made the mistake of grabbing at the first cart's goodies, like quinoa (good but not worth the price point and tummy space).   Just know that the classics to order are: -one of the pancake dishes. It's more like the texture of a flat Chinese bun than a breakfast pancake, which gave it a nice bite. Nice that they supplied us 3 for a party of 3. -fried quail. YUMMY. They put seeds in the batter and its not greasy at all. Paired with some delicious onions and parm. -pork belly. Need I say more? -Sophisticated duck fried rice! Was worried this would be a filler, but it ended up being liked around the table and we were tempted to get the full size.  Other fun dishes: -kimchi tofu...they turned tofu into pasta! This is what a swanky Korean dish dares to be -steak tartare has a really nice wasabi taste to it  -ice dessert which had coconut tapioca on the bottom, along with yuzu. Sophisticated bao bing!  Plenty of clean fresh plates to swap, water refilled constantly and food turnarounds pretty fast. I would love to dine here again if I can get lucky with no wait. It's a very fun experience with solid, upscale American food with a hipster ambiance.",

The food was either bland or unevenly salted and the waiter took a while to come around. Usually it was with the same thing. Can't help but think about all the inefficiencies of the place - having the waiters take the time to explain to every table what they're bringing and not taking requests for the tray foods. I left not eating some of the stuff I wanted and trying other things I wouldn't have tried in the first place given other options. The price is pretty expensive for what I ate. Came out full but feeling misled by all the rave reviews. I'm glad we went with reservation. If I waited in line for this I would've gone nuts.",

    "review_text": "SBP opened New Years Eve 2011/2012, not quite seven weeks ago, so they still have plenty of room to grow and develop their menu. The food style is Asian/California/Italian. (Somewhat like the late-great-Oritalia on Fillmore.)   SBP has a rather unique concept: A very abbreviated printed dinner menu, supplemented by small courses on carts or trays wheeled or carried by a friendly and knowledgeable staff to the patrons' tables. These latter plates are not listed on the menu, but the prices are clearly displayed on the carts and trays.  Next time I go I probably won't order immediately from the printed menu, but instead take my first courses from the carts and trays, and possibly add some menu selections later.  What we ordered from the printed menu:  * Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancakes... $6 * Char-grilled chicories with yogurt, dates &amp; almonds... $6 * Halibut with hazelnut and mandarin... $18 * Ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms &amp; spinach... $16  What we took from the carts/trays:  * Raw vegetable and fruit with whipped goat cheese... $6  * Mushrooms with parsnip puree... $6  My comments:  The four small pancakes were fine, although they would have benefited from a dab of some interesting sour cream concoction on top. Also, the sauerkraut must have been cooked into the pancakes but it was not apparent in the flavor.  The chicory greens were very good, if a bit acidic from added lemon, vinegar or vinaigrette. (Cooking these in the open kitchen may have contributed to the slight smokiness of the room.) \u00a0  The halibut was dry and flavorless in an unpleasantly acidic (again), very minimal, sauce.  The cavatelli pasta was a laughably small serving. Tasty, but the mushroom-to-spinach-to-pasta ratio didn't include enough pasta, and was not satisfying at $16.  The raw vegetables were fine and the whipped goat cheese was very good.  The mushrooms and parsnip puree needs work. The cooked mushrooms should have been warmed (they were cold) and there was too little puree.  Wine list is short but good (we had only one glass of Beaujolais) and the hazelnut apricot linzer bars (which were comped) were tasty.   SBP needs to offer some heartier dishes. Also, for diners who might not be enthusiastic about the unusual flavors of some dishes, they should offer a few standbys with a more comfort-food orientation. They grill chicory, why not grill other vegetables and maybe potatoes with a romesco sauce (they like nuts at SBP)? Dial-down the acidic elements and offer dishes with more rounded flavors. Olive oil, anyone? How about some bread and butter? Most importantly, increase the serving sizes - we both left hungry having spent $81 including tax and tip.  In the end, I do appreciate what they're trying to do and applaud their effort. The staff was very good. I will probably go back.  Oh, yeah. Music choice was not so great. They're in an historic area of great jazz and vintage SF rock. Go for the jazz and leave Johnny Cash to the BBQ joints.",

Its unpretentious vibe welcomes foodies who are willing to wait for the delicious spoils this place puts out. Make your reservations early, or wait in line for a few hours, whichever way has brought you there, be ready to eat! The portions are good and the food comes out steadily, choose from the seasonal menu or from the dim-sum style carts circulating the restaurant. If you're looking for a good place to eat without having to dawn the suit and tie or heels , State Bird is a great choice! The crunchy with the chewy , spicy and sour, hot with cold, its a great culinary experience without skimping on the fine-dining portions. A little hipsterish , but you should be there for the food, don't mind the others :) We'll be back when we get another opportunity. What a great tingle for the senses!",

The trick is arriving early before they open: we arrived at 4:30 pm on a weekday and they open for walk-ins at 5:15 pm. i.e. you're waiting in line outside so prepare for colorful pan handing and bring a book.   Food: Amazing Staff and Service: Amazing Reservation process: Does it exist?

Highlights include the State Bird (fried quail)...everything was great. The thing that really sets State Bird apart is the way the food is served: Dim Sum-style on carts. This method provides for opportunity to try a bunch of menu items. When I came with a group--6-8 people--they serve all menu items family style.

There are 1 of 2 reasons for this: 1) my palate isn't culinary enough to know what the heck I was eating/why it was special or 2) this place wasn't that great - I'd like to believe the latter.  Came here for a special birthday and without a reservation, arrived at 5pm per the yelp reviews and restaurant staff suggestions. We were 2nd in line, luckily not a minute later, because this line definitely grew fast. When the doors opened, we were given seats at the counter (maybe this is just for walk-ins, but the coupe behind us sat at a table and they didn't seem to have a reservation, so it would've been nice to ask us which we preferred since I forgot to ask in the organized chaos of the check in process, somewhat organized, somewhat stressful, somewhat happy because you realize you got a seat!). *ding #1 - don't sit at the counter if you can help it, if you're going to pay 100+ for a meal, it's best not spent crammed between 3 men.*  Food started arriving quickly, tapas style, I jumped the gun and ordered steak tartar to be adventurous, not realizing that this may later cause a week of upset stomach. Second dish, also jumped the gun in excitement, said YES to the Duck Liver, forgetting that I actually don't like Liver, but it was creamy and the little buns served with it are quite good, but nothing special. A handful of mediocre dishes came and went, so we ordered from the menu. Had to try the state bird - why you would point out that you are eating the California State Bird by naming your restaurant this, baffles me, but this was very good. Tender and juicy with a crispy exterior - lives up to its expectations. Oxtail Curry - is very odd and not worth ordering *ding2*, definitely a miss. Curry flavor was subtle but this had no \"light up my tastebuds\" quality to it. The raw oysters were very fresh and the seafood salad with toasted chips (tasted a little like salsa) was very good as well.  The sole reason for the review and the stars - BURRATA. This was AMAZING and when we had this, I thought the night was taking a turn for the better, but it didn't. The cheese was so fresh and a great compliment to the flaky burrata. Dessert was very yummy too and I may be biased as I love sweets, but the ice cream sandwich is a must try.  The bartender was swamped in the beginning which didn't allow her much time to socialize, so yes she was doing her job, but no she kind of wasn't. She wasn't overly friendly nor amused when we asked what certain things are - one of my biggest pet peeves at fancy places when they treat you like you aren't fancy enough. She lightened up by the end of the night, maybe she was just busy. Most of the staff seemed stand-off-ish but at times friendly, so honestly, this also baffles me *ding #3*  Long story short: I trusted Bon Appetit and a trusted culinary friend's recommendation, but I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high or they just didn't live up to the hype. Few good items, but not enough to make me come early or make a 60day in advance reservation to come again.",

    "review_text": "I've always wanted to try State Bird Provision but didn't have any luck with the online reservation system.   On Sunday afternoon, I decided to try my luck and wait in line for a table. Arrived at around 4:50pm, and I could already see 30+ people standing in line. It wasn't until 5:50pm when I finally got to the front of the line, and was told that the next seating will be at 9:45pm. After waiting in line for an hour, I was just happy to get a table.   How do you spend 4 hours waiting? Well, you can catch a movie at Sundance kabuki theater, walk around Japantown, enjoy some live music at Yoshi's.  Finally 9:45pm rolls around and the restaurant is still packed with guests. We waited again until 10:20pm before we could get seated. At this point I'm starving, and could eat an entire village. We tried the following dishes:  1. CA state bird with provisions (whole) Very tender and delicious. I gobbled the entire bird as I was starving. Highly recommend ordering this.  2. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit Reminds me of foie gras, but less solid in texture. Delicious.  3. Raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame We were told the oysters were from virginia. Not sure why they wouldn't just use Bay Area oysters. The oysters were just OK, nothing spectacular  4. Duck &amp; fontina croquettes It was hard to taste the duck, it's just like eating regular croquette.  5. Garlic bread with burrata Was disappointed with this one. Taste like dough-y cheese puffs.   6. Pork belly plum salad My favorite dish of the night. Tender, crispy and moist pork belly in a fusion of amazing flavors. This is one dish you must try!  7. Roasted bone marrow with mushroom &amp; pink peppercorn It's good but a bit too salty for me. The odd thing is they give you a tiny plate of salt in case you want to add more salt   8. Cumin lamb with squid,snap peas, Thai basil &amp; dates The squid was tender and delicious. The lamb is tender and flavorful. Love this dish.  Overall, the dishes were creative and delicious. There were exceptional dishes like the pork belly, duck mousse, and fried quail. However, the rest of the dishes taste too salty (and fatty) for my taste.  Would I wait another 5.5 hours for SBP again? Probably not.",

    "review_text": "I love the concept of an American / Fusion dim sum restaurant. If you haven't been, here is how it works...  HOW IT WORKS: There is one seafood cart that goes around with a static 4-5 dishes to choose from. There are about 8 other dim-sum style items that rotate, it took about 40 minutes for us to see the full rotation. They have a small menu with apps / entrees / desserts / drinks.  THE FOOD: All of it was delicious, and the tab definitely adds up quick! They are famous for their pancakes (loved the pecorino), and the fried quail (good but didn't blow my mind). My absolute favorite dish of the night was the nori chip with kampachi on top, followed by a seasonal crab stew. Freakin amazing.   I thought the fried garlic bread with burrata was a bit overrated, and the mushroom dumpling in dashi sauce was OK, but the best way to experience State Bird is to just try it all because everything is unique and very fresh. Go with 2-3 people and get the full experience.  THE DRINKS: The wine and beer list is decent, and given the food prices, I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious Malbec and Saisons I had (only $9 and $6 respectively).  I would definitely recommend State Bird, and encourage you to make a reservation - there are last minute options available on OpenTable. The line on a weekday at opening was ridiculous, I would never wait. For someone with a big appetite like me, it can be expensive but it doesn't have to be. Come in and order a bunch of dishes to try, and you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!",

    "review_text": "I enjoyed this place. Went on a random Tuesday night without reservations at 5:10 and just missed the first 5:30pm seating. Why is this place so jam packed? Mardi Gras that night in the Fillmore? Maybe, but I would like to say it is because of the well warranted buzz surrounding their delicious food and novel concept. Burrata fried bread and nori fish thing were great. Dinner at the bar overlooking the kitchen enhanced the experience. We got superb service from Glenn and had fun watching him and others assemble each wave of dishes. Drink and wine menu were fine. Atmosphere was hipstery and alright. Key thing, everyone felt welcome there and I saw so many happy dinners. I was one of them.  Try to get a reservation or get off work as early as you can to get a walk in spot. Worth experiencing at least once.",

    "review_text": "Apart from the ridiculous reservation operations and wait time for non-reservationists, this place churns out good food with an interesting twist in service. \u00a0I didn't have reservations so I arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes before it opened, only to find that there were at least 30 people already in line ahead of me. By the time I spoke to the hostess a few minutes after 5:30, I was told the wait would be 2 hours for a standing spot at the counter in the front area of the restaurant and to return around that time unless I receive a text with an earlier spot. \u00a0So my friend and I bided our time over drinks and a couple of snacks at a wine bar around the corner. \u00a0I received a text at 7:10 that our table was ready. \u00a0  After closing out our tab and heading over to SBP, we were seated at a counter in the middle of the restaurant, WITH STOOLS! \u00a0So that was a pleasant surprise and a good start to my dining experience there despite the long wait time. \u00a0We had a very pleasant staff person/waiter standing in front of us, who would handle our menu orders and drinks. \u00a0We ordered the garlic bread with burrata, CA state bird with provisions and the Mendocito sea urchin pancakes off the menu. \u00a0There were other staff walking around with either carts or trays of food to offer to diners, akin to dim sum style. \u00a0We decided on the roasted vegetables romesco, raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame, dashi pickled greens and smoked wild king salmon with pea hummus &amp; meyer lemon. \u00a0The garlic bread with burrata was pretty good but the bread became a bit too overwhelming and dense the more I ate it. \u00a0The CA state bird and Mendocito sea urchin pancakes were amazing. \u00a0The roasted vegetables romesco was good but the almonds were not blended in the sauce and were left whole, so the dish tasted better when you took a bit of everything including the almonds. \u00a0I didn't really care for the dashi picked greens but the smoked wild king salmon was amazing. \u00a0My friend was avoiding dairy so she didn't want dessert but the pleasant waiter in front of us told me that they could make a half portion of the lemon curd ice cream sandwich, which he recommended as his favorite dessert. \u00a0The dessert was pretty good but what was astonishing to me was how well it paired with the fennel. \u00a0  The good will of the restaurant to be willing to half portion my dessert was a good end to my pleasant dining experience here. \u00a0In general, the staff here is very nice and pleasant despite how busy the place was. \u00a0I would love to come back and try more of the dishes but am a bit wary of the wait time.",

The idea might be cute but half of the dishes we ordered were just ok. \u00a0The beef tongue, the beef cheek salad, tuna with Quinoa, chips with their own dipping would be the only dishes I recommend.

    "review_text": "First off, let me be clear that I write this out of love. \u00a0(It takes a lot for me to actually write a Yelp review.) \u00a0On food alone, SBP is my favorite new restaurant in the City, and I think one of the best food experiences in the city period.  That said, after my last experience, I'm convinced they have some service issues that they really need to correct. \u00a0We arrived for a 9:30 Wednesday (the only reservation you can generally get within a few weeks) and waited until around 9:50 to be seated. \u00a0Not a particularly big deal, but it would be nice if the host would at least acknowledge it, given that they must know 95% of their 9:30 reservations are because people HAD to book then, not because they wanted to....  The real issue was once we sat down and our server proceeded to VERY casually (many older patrons would probably say \"rudely\") explain how because it's late, a few carts will still come around but we should probably just order the stuff we want. \u00a0After you've waited 20 extra minutes on an already late reservation, that's a pretty big bummer for the server to basically imply they're winding down, so just forget the primary concept of the restaurant and order.... If you need to start closing up at 10, that's fine.... but don't seat people then and treat them as an afterthought. \u00a0Just cut off the reservations at 9.  I think part of the issue is that at SBP, the service is always very casual. \u00a0My first two visits, this was part of the charm, because it really adds to the fun/whimsy of a blowoff. \u00a0 \u00a0   Again, i love the food. \u00a0All three trips have offered new, exciting stuff that just isn't happening anywhere else in the city. \u00a0But regardless of how great the food is, I left feeling embarrassed for the people at how non-chalant they were about pretty crappy service. \u00a0I'm sure I'll be back, but I really wouldn't recommend doing the late reservation... and hope the staff isn't reading too much of their own good press to hold themselves to a higher standard than what we experienced the other night.",

    "review_text": "Came here at 4:30pm or so on a Monday and waited in line for an hour. It was fun to see the chefs in the window trying various dishes of the day. Without a sign on the front door, I felt totally \"underground\" and cool. We made friends with others in line and took dish recommendations.  I would highly recommend a seat at the bar as you're in the center of the activity and can witness them cooking up a storm. It is like dim sum or new American tapas, with waiters whizzing around with various dishes. Definitely be in an adventurous mindset when you go there!  My main complaint (to echo some of the previous comments) is that it is VERY SALTY and fairly over-priced. But there were definitely some highlights such as the quail eggs, the duck liver mousse i.e. adult cupcakes :), various mushroom dishes, and a delectable wine menu -- highly recommend their viognier.  For dessert, we polished off the cornbread (mild) and a layered ice cream dessert that was out of this world. Overall a really positive experience! My friend and I high-fived on the way out .... success! :)",

We were very early for our reservation, and Mary the GM immediately went back, found a table for us, and sat us. As was mentioned in other reviews, it seems like everyone there is really excited to be there; super inviting!  As for the food, it was stellar! We especially loved the sweet potato salad, the pork farro with soft egg, the pork ribs, and the lemon blueberry ice cream sandwich. Half of the time, we didn't even know everything we were eating; just that it tasted really good.  I liked the ambiance a lot, too; the pegboard wall, concrete wall, and small cafeteria-type feel is kindof the point, and there still manages to be an ambiance! Definitely recommended!",

    "review_text": "In short, the food here is executed at a very high technical level, with friendly staff, and flavors &amp; techniques you have likely not seen before.   As far as food- be sure to grab 1-2 plates of the oxtail &amp; pepper bread-- the braised meat lining the fried bread is an experience. Ask how the bread is prepared.  Oh. Oh. And the pork ribs are excellent. Braised then grilled goodness.  The staff touted the fried quail as the hallmark dish, but the idea felt kitschy, the appearance clunky, and flavor under-whelming.  Chicories- unfortunately these were inedible...beyond sour &amp; burned.  As far as service &amp; timing, you need to bare in mind that SBP has opened very recently AND re-invented a style of dining, their timing will be ironed out in coming months.   That being said, it would have been nice to have received more attention from the wait staff in between dishes. \u00a0First-month diners are worth listening to: they've likely anticipated your opening for weeks, if not, months; and likely know more about your concept than you think.  As far as additions, a full bar would be nice, of course license permitting. \u00a0For what they do carry, \u00a0I didn't really get the wine program. I'm always curious to hear the story behind the wine list &amp; why specific wines were carried. Didn't get that.  SBP is for the SF diner seeking a new experience, but with seasoned staff, and intricate flavors. You'll also need to be patient, show up hungry &amp; not mind the Reagan-era dining room interior.",

Everything is very Japanese inspired; I'm talking dashi, chawanmushi, okonomiyaki, etc. \u00a0There's still quite the American take on it because of the heaviness that the food leaves your body, which is why I'm guessing they use so much citrus, acidity, and/or yuzu. \u00a0There were some points where I felt like every dish was like this.  While I can't remember the 15+ dishes we ordered, I'll list out some of my favorites: -Garlic bread with burrata -Duck liver mousse with mini cornbread -Seafood dashi -Beef tongue and horseradish-buckwheat pancake  -Fresh oysters -Quinoa-cauliflower tabouleh with local nori -Fresh vegetables with anchovy-like hummus  I was a little disappointed with: -CA state bird (expensive for what it is) -Quail fried duck tender (tasted like same batter as the CA state bird) -Bacon-curry with crispy beef sweetbreads and pickled kohlrabi (would've been nice if the sweetbreads weren't fried) -Brown butter rice pudding (tasted like oatmeal)  Four seems to be the ideal number in a group to be dining here. \u00a0You can easily share each dish without over stuffing yourself but you'll still get more than a bite. \u00a0If the dish is too small, you can get another one to share. \u00a0The key to enjoying your meal here is to get drinks and slowly pace yourself through the food. \u00a0You'll also save money this way.",

I know that making reservations for State Bird online is almost like a lottery, or registering for classes that you're in dire need of, but I hope that doesn't discourage you from ever trying this place!

    "review_text": "4 STARS for the creativity of their restaurant. Call me crazy, but I was one of those people who woke up at 4AM just to make a reservation. The reservation date (May) was 60 days from when I booked it (back in March), so I decided to take this advantage to take my parents here for an early Mother's Day dinner. Was it worth it? DEFINITELY.  State Bird Provisions offers tapas style food served on dim sum carts and trays. Loved this concept because I thought it was pretty creative and different. There's a small menu that lists pancakes, commandables, and desserts. There are also other dishes offered on their rotating dim sum trays and carts. I'm not going to go deep into the details of the food we tried, but just the gist of it. --- Rabbit P\u00e2t\u00e9: Kinda reminded me of the duck liver mousse, which I preferred more than the rabbit. It had this interesting taste that I wasn't too big of a fan of. :(  Duck and Pea Croquette: Just OK. Not my cup of tea.. :(  Duck Ham-Maitake, Pecan Pancake with Kumquat Mustard: Originally, I thought it was just going to be a regular pancake but with duck. I was wrong. It was actually pretty unique and tasty! There were so many bursting flavors. All the ingredients just meshed well together! The duck wasn't too fatty nor gamey.   Garlic Bread with Burrata Cheese: Garlic bread was just OK, didn't really taste the garlic in it.. But loved the burrata cheese! Big portion of the cheese.  Beef Tongue and Potato Dumpling: Beef tongue was OK, but really liked the potato dumpling! Chewy on the inside, but crispy and fried on the outside.  Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits: Really enjoyed the duck liver mousse. Smooth and flavorful. The almond biscuit complemented it very well.  Egg Custard with Sambal and Green Onions: Pretty interesting and tasty. It was like a soup but with egg custard in it. Really liked the kick to it.   CA State Bird (Whole): State Bird = Quail. Just OK, had a little bit of crisp to it.   Roti of Curry Rabbit: JUST OK. Not too memorable. Presentation was eh...  Crispy Pork Belly: I love pork belly and I liked how it wasn't too fatty nor oily. Had that crisp to it.   Hamachi on a Nori Chip: YUMMY! Hamachi was very fresh and the nori chip was very crispy. It was not too heavy.  CA Black &amp; White Bao, Saffron Custard, Golden Raisins, Pistachios: The bao was just a regular bao.. Nothing too special.. However, I did really enjoyed the custard meshed with the raisins and pistachios.   Chocolate 'Ice Cream' Sandwich, Smoked Meringue, Spicy Cocoa Nibs, Strawberries: Sad, we missed when they were serving black sesame or the poppy seed ice cream sandwich a few weeks ago. :( This dessert was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit too normal. :( --- Overall, I do not regret waking up at 4AM to make this reservation. Definitely worth the experience. Service was excellent and the staff were pretty friendly and accommodating. The total bill was about $150 for 3 people, which was not bad at all, especially since we got to try out so many different types of dishes. Plus, my parents both enjoyed it since it's something different from the usual. If you do plan on giving State Bird Provisions a visit, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend getting reservations IN ADVANCE!!! :)",

Love the way that it is dim sum style where they bring around different dishes as well as the menu you can order from. Wait staff super awesome and informative, can flag down anyone and they would help you.   On to the food:  Really like the pancakes - we tried the corn and duck ones and they were both amazing, probably out favorite dishes of the night. The garlic bread with barrata cheese was so good we got another one at the end of the meal.  We also got the steak and salmon tartares. The steak tartare was good but pretty standard. The salmon tartare was about the same except the roasted quinoa was a really nice touch. The Kimchi yuba was interesting but not sure if I'm crazy about the combination. The cumin squid and lamb was good, very strong cumin flavors and left us wanting some rice to go with such an Asian inspired dish. We got the poppy cake and ice cream sandwiches for dessert and they were AMAZING! Best part of the meal! Things that were just meh - The hen dumpling broth was a bit too salty, the green beans with bay shrimp was not memorable at all, lacking flavors. The state bird was fried quail that was just too dry.  Overall an amazing experience and will def come back if I can get a reservation again but will likely stick with what I know I liked.o",

    "review_text": "Oh my goodness! This place is absolutely amazing! It's entertaining/fun, refined, and \u00a0delicious, all at the same time! Everything was perfect with this restaurant. The service, environment, and food was excellent.   If you're planning on coming here without a reservation, make sure you arrive at least an hour and a half before dinner service to wait in line. Otherwise, it will be an even longer wait! My boyfriend and I came here without a reservation and got in line around 4pm (they open at 5:30pm) and there were already about 15 people in line. When they opened for dinner service, we were seated immediately. The wait wasn't bad at all especially because the State Bird Provisions people prepared spiced hot cocoa for everyone waiting in line! That was a very sweet gesture!   When we were seated the waitress enthusiastically explained the restaurant's way of serving food. Food is served dim-sum style; there's about a dozen different small-portioned dishes (tapas) that are served from a cart that get's pushed around the restaurant. The servers describe the dish and when you see/hear something you like, you notify the server pushing the cart and they serve it to you and mark your bill to keep track of your orders. In addition to dishes that are served in the carts, there is also a menu with more dishes you could order from.   I tried:  Oyster topped with togarashi and toasted sesame - $3 each The raw oyster was clean, fresh, and naturally sweet. It was delicious!  Rabbit fontina croquette - $2 each I never had rabbit before this. It was interesting and pretty good, the meat it a bit tougher than chicken and it tasted a lot like carnitas (pork).   Mendocino sea urchin, ginger scallion pancake with soy lime glaze - $14 This dish was savory and filling. The savory pancake is sprinkled with baby greens and the soy lime glaze and topped with sweet sea urchin. I really liked this dish because sea urchin is one of my favorite things. This had a very asian fusion feel to it. It's worth getting because it can fill you up. All the dishes are very small, so you have to order quite a lot to get full and this can add up pretty quickly.  CA state bird with provisions (half order) - $8 This is deep fried quail topped with parmesan on a bed of cooked onions. The breading for the quail was flavorful and the quail itself was moist and very good. This dish was highly recommended by our server.  Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth - $3 each dumpling This was probably my favorite! The broth was incredibly flavorful and the dumpling was so so yummy. Must try this!  Grilled beef with maitake with bok choy - $18 My boyfriend ordered this dish because it was one of the few non-seafood options they had. He loved it. The beef was well-seasoned and tender and the grilled mushrooms were incredible. This dish was a little pricey for the amount of food, but it was worth getting.  Hamachi, avocado, on toasted nori - $9 There were cubes of raw hamashi and avocado on a piece of toasted nori. The nori was more like a nori chip, it was thick and very crunchy. The sauce, hamachi, avocado, and nori (seaweed) all went well together. This was probably my second favorite dish!  Dessert - Spiced pomegranate granita (shaved ice), lemongrass tapioca, and persimmons (half portion) - $ 4 You can ask for half portions for desserts! That way you could try different desserts! This dessert was interesting, the granita was very strong with a pomegranate and plum taste. It was like nothing I have ever tasted in a good way. All the flavors from all the ingredients used in the dessert had an interesting taste. If you're feeling adventurous, try this dessert!  Dessert - Bittersweet chocolate ganache tart, brown sugar-oat crust, and olive oil (half portion) - $4 This was our favorite dessert. The chocolate and tart crust was not at all overpoweringly sweet (which we liked a lot). The chocolate ganache was a little bitter and had the right amount of sweetness. It also came with sunflower whipped cream! That also very delicious. This was a great end to a great meal!!   FYI: Most of the options here were seafood options - most of the dishes being served on the dim-sum style carts were seafood. And there were a few non-seafood options they had were on their menu.   The restaurant environment was very refined and also very youthful, hip, and trendy. \u00a0The food is plated with finesse and everything looked sophisticated and well-thought out. All the servers and chefs were great! They were super friendly and informative, and really wanted to make everyone's experience there amazing. My boyfriend and I loved our experience here! It's one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I highly recommend this restaurant! :D",

Here is my take:  -Somebody started this restaurant and gave it a weird name. I hear someone says: \"we are going to State Bird Provisions\" tonight. And I'm like thinking in my head what is that? Would I look stupid if I ask? I just Google it later...probably some bird watching place.  -The restaurant found a few people, who told a few other people, who then told a few more people, that this place is \"amazing\"...It's \"must go\". So somehow everybody already thinks this place is amazing before going there. -Then I can't make a reservation...so I walk there and wait around 3 hours for a table. I go to Dosa for some GREAT appetizer and few drinks and laugh, waiting for the bigger part of the night. So you already think it's a big deal. -I put in the address in my iPhone and \"you have arrived at your destination\" but um...there is no sign on the door! ooo! An element of mystery! This must be good. I already know I'm coming back here. I mean...at least have a picture of a bird or something on the door.  -I am finally sitting at my table wondering what is this all about. They come around with carts, dim sum style (very cool concept actually...the only special thing about this place).  -I'm starving...and everything is coming to us fast in little tiny plates...and they are \"infused\" with this name-u-never-heard-before or \"garnished\" with that-other-name-u-never-heard before. And oh, of course some trendy ingredient, like \"Quinoa\", that I have almost every day at home. Sh*t! Must be good. But it's just so mediocre. Like nothing special about it in the end. -I am not satisfied with the cart stuff and I am still trying to find the awe-inspiring factor. So I pick up the menu to order a \"real\" Tapa or meal that is more than half-a-bite. It comes...same deal...not special at all...still half a bite...like I think I accidentally swallowed it before I tasted it. -Still not giving up! Maybe the desert. I don't know...Just OK I guess. -I asked for the check...couldn't wait to get home to my jar of peanut butter.  There must be another star hidden somewhere...but I couldn't find it. Maybe I'll go back again looking for it.",

We thought they were kidding because everything on the menu looked amazing. Thankfully we listened to them. After ordering we were bombarded with tons of amazing looking dishes on carts with price tags ranging from 5-9 dollars.   The portions were more than enough for a party of 4 to share per plate and the price was unbelievable cheap (around 50 per person and we had around 15 dishes). The food was delicious. The cornbread with duck liver mousse maybe a loop hole around foie gras but it was GOOD. Try the pig ears! Fat is good!  Since it is a dim sum experience, I would recommend going with a party of 4 (max allowed) so you get to try more dishes. I do think the portions are large for a party of 2 which would limit the variety you get.",

A really nice option as lots of folks are walking in.  - Ability to sample lots of small plates is great. but most of the dishes were good but not amazing.   - LImited Vegetarian options or just greens in general - but if you want lots of meat this place might be for you.

Well to be honest out of everything I ate I was not impressed with anything. - felt like the food was lacking flavor and ingredients. \u00a0I left this place $120 lighter and still hungry... \u00a0  I'd love to give it another try, but later when they will figure out the menu....",

Top off your experience with a seat at the chef's counter (foodie friends only) and chit chat with the chefs and get food right off the burner. LOVE IT.  In the 3 times I've gone, these are the items we ate each time: - State Bird - quail is delightful, if only the portion were bigger - Pork Belly with citrus salad - Crispy nori cracker with hamachi and avocado  Other highlights: ice cream sandwiches to die for, buttery lobster, duck plate, uni pancake, guinea hen dumplings in aromatic broth. mmm ... ah the list goes on. Try it if you can but remember to pace yourself because there is always something else new coming out of that little kitchen.",

Overall, I would say that State Bird Provisions does a fabulous job of making \"healthy\" foods taste delicious! \u00a0For example, I usually hate quinoa and cauliflower, but their quinoa and cauliflower dishes were amongst my favorites! \u00a0These were the highlights of our meal:  * shiitake, persimmon &amp; quinoa 'tabouleh' (we couldn't figure out what the crunchy element was, maybe toasted quinoa, but whatever it was, it really made the dish!) * spicy fried cauliflower salad, bayley hazen blue cheese &amp; fermented green tomatoes (spicing up the cauliflower makes it delicious) * duck liver mousse with almond biscuit * pork belly grape salad (the pork belly was deep fried and heavenly) * sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta * spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (they don't numb the heat, it was actually a tongue stimulating spicy!) * eggnog ice cream sandwich (fluffy, not-too-sweet goodness)  I can't wait for the next excuse to dine there again!",

We loved pretty much all the dishes off-menu. The menu is great but I'd recommend choosing the daily dishes. We enjoyed the state bird, confit duck leg and pancake with sturgeon from the menu - all were faultless but we preffered the oysters, dumplings in broth, hamachi rice cake and octopus that were brought out to us.

    "review_text": "Food: My mouth is watering, just thinking of it again. It's an East meets West tapas restaurant, where they serve food like yam cha or dim sum, on carts. But there was an option for a tasting menu, which I was guess were for larger groups that were harder to access by cart. It was my friend's party, 8 people. So we got the tasting menu rather than choosing from the cart. Everything that was on the tasting menu was excellant. I'll load up photos at the end of the review. A couple of my friends have been here before and highly recommended the seaweed crackers, which was included in the menu and I was so happy. I usually don't eat fish, but if there are a scattered few pieces I'll definitely eat it, especially for this price point. All 1-8 course I found delicious, but as it got progressively more Asian (I'm Asian, I tend to not eat a lot of Chinese food when I'm out with friends, just because that's all my parents love to eat when we go out together) I wasn't as excited, but they were delicious too.   Service: Excellant, our server was attentive and personable. We were a group where only two of us were drinking some sort of extra beverage, and only 1 was alcoholic. But he consistently visited our table and filled our waters, they were never empty. At the start of the meal, he made sure to ask if there were any dietary restrictions, I, oh horrible genes, have a shellfish and peanut allergy. Luckily when I sat down I took \u00a0a look at the menu and it looked like there was only 1 conflict, the clam &amp; potato okonomiyaki. And he proceeded to do the same after I had informed him. The person who had planned our dinner had put down his card to hold the table, and when our waiter dropped off the bill, and we had paid our friend. I had to make sure we weren't skipping out on the bill, because my friend had not signed any slip and I didn't see an authorized copy. So we asked our waiter to clarify so we weren't just jumping out on our bill, even if they had his card on hold. Which our server politely went to check on. So the hold card is not charged when you are reserving a party, once you receive the bill you have a choice of paying in cash or using the hold card or another card if you prefer. Do not walk in, \u00a0unless you have time to wait and are lucky. It's a 2 hour limit per table. I had overhead from the hostess that it was a 2 month reservation book at this point.  Ambiance: The friend, who's dinner this was for, didn't enjoy the pop of color that some of the paintings had, thought it was out of place. It was pretty loud, we had to speak loudly across the table and it was hard to hear what my friends were saying. We were in a small alcove so all the body heat was bouncing around. Probably why we were drinking so much water. A guy who was inline with me for the restroom from San Diego had commented that he felt like he was always in someone's way in restaurants in SF. Which was the case at SBP, you'll have to side step and excuse your way around.",

I'm more of a filmore deli + zeitgeist kind of guy, but happened into a sizable gift card after speaking at a conference in town. I'd heard the hype about the place for a while, and expected that the $100 gift card wouldn't go far, but the portions were surprisingly meager for the price. The food was definitely interesting, but left unfilled and more confused than satisfied. In the end I was longing for an egg sandwich of sizable portions.  All that said, an interesting experience.

Thanks to all of the yelp reviews, our friends arrived at 4:20pm and was the third group in line! The first group arrived at 3:30pm! The line grew to 30+ people by 5pm! We were immediately seated at 5:30 (it looked like 10-15 people were able to sit at 5:30). They also served hot chocolate while we waited in line, that was nice.  They have food on a menu that is made to order like pancakes and the quail. They also have food that are on trays and carts for you to see...this one entices your palate with your eyes. It's sort of funny to see the look of rejection that some of the staff have when you don't want a certain dish (in dim sum the ladies don't care, haha). My favorite made to order dish was the ribs and the quail. The ribs are not baby back but very tender. I was indifferent about the sourkraut pancakes. Of the tray/cart dishes, I liked the salad that had slices of rare beef and mushrooms in it (sorry don't remember what they called it). My favorite dessert was the earl gray ice cream sandwich with the dried fruit soaked in riesling. While the dessert sounded fancy, it was yummy and didn't taste complicated. The cheesecake was ok, it was very fluffy and not cheesy enough, if you're ok with that.   Overall it was a good experience. If you walk in and are a group of 4, make sure you come EARLY. Otherwise a group of 2 has better luck of scoring a table, bar seating or even standing at the bar. If you don't want to deal with waiting, then I highly suggest just making a reservation far in advance.",

SBP has been on my radar for a long time, but I could never manage to snag a reservation. \u00a0Granted I didn't try very hard (not waiting by the computer at 4AM), so it was very fortunate that LR generously donated her reservation to J &amp; me this past weekend (relax people, she changed plans and went out of town). \u00a0  AMBIANCE: So popular/awesome that there are absolutely NO signs for this restaurant outside! \u00a0Too cool for school. \u00a0The space is on the small side, covered with pegboard, and is on the casual side-- I definitely felt overdressed in my dress/heels. \u00a0Tables are well spaced, and there are a fair number of larger tables for groups. \u00a0Lighting is on the dimmer side, but it adds to the laid back, relaxed vibe.  SERVICE: Very friendly. \u00a0Its all hands on deck, especially with since several servers are circulating the floor carry trays or pushing carts full of goodies dim sum style. \u00a0Our main server (Melissa? \u00a0Sorry, I didn't quite catch her name) was awesome. \u00a0Just the right amount of camaraderie with diners while still maintaining professionalism.  * side note: despite having a reservation, we ended up having to wait around 10-15min for our table... which was slightly annoying.  FOOD: Don't feel obligated to read all my descriptions below. \u00a0The cliff notes version: everything was delicious. \u00a0Flavors ranged from delicate and subtle to bold and in your face. \u00a0My #1 advice to first time diners? \u00a0SLOW PLAY IT. \u00a0J and I went all savage and ordered everything in sight within 5min of sitting down haha (we finished our meal in a little over an hr). \u00a0Next time I will go slow and savor everything.   - Dungeness crab with quinoa (?) porridge: so light, delicate and delicious! \u00a0A close second fave dish of the night. - Smoked salmon/trout: Possibly my favorite of the night. \u00a0The smokiness from the fish was the dominant flavor of the dish, but the potatoes (? something slightly mushy/creamy in texture) and other components of the dish were the perfect supporting players. \u00a0Despite the bold savory flavors, this dish still came off as light and delicate. - Garlic bread with burrata: fluffy, decadent burrata floated like clouds above a rich garlic bread twist. \u00a0Best eaten/devoured immediately upon ordering-- this dish only gets heavier as it cools down. - Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit: probably my least favorite dish of the night, not b/c of the flavor profile, but because of the combination of textures. \u00a0I was expecting a crunchy almond biscuit, so the small \"almond\" cakes (couldn't detect any almond flavor) just didn't do it for me.  - State bird w/ provisions (whole $16): J loved this dish. \u00a0Perfectly fried (not at all greasy), fabulously tender and juicy... MMM. \u00a0The lemon onions were a perfect pairing for the quail.  - Cauliflower ($14): such an interesting dish. \u00a0Our server described it as \"cauliflower buffalo wing style\" and that's exactly what it was. \u00a0I wish this dish came in half portion because the full serving was a bit much for two people. \u00a0 - Trout (half $11): so tender and light. \u00a0I really liked the combination of flavors and textures-- the toasted hazelnuts provided a welcome contrasting crunch to the perfectly cooked fish. - Charred baby octopus: I really liked this dish, but it was one of the worst for J because it was too salty (the tentacles; the body had more meat and was perfectly seasoned). \u00a0The octopus was quite tender, and had just the right amount of chew for me.  - Yuba noodles with kimchi: this was another letdown for me, though I can't decide if its because I was pretty full by the time we ordered this, or because I was expecting a cold dish. \u00a0We ended up taking the leftovers home, and I was right, it does taste better cold. - Peanut milk ($2/shot): smooth peanutty goodness. \u00a0I wouldn't go out of my way to order this, though I'm glad we tried it.  - Oolong ice cream sandwich ($8): MMM such delicious, delicate flavors. \u00a0The pepitas macarons used in the sandwich were a touch too chewy/stick, but I loved the flavor combination. \u00a0The smear of apricot jam was such a bright, bold punchy addition that J loved, but I found to be overpowering when eaten with the other components of the dessert (it was really good on its own though). \u00a0  OVERALL: Definitely lived up to the hype. \u00a0This was probably one of the best dining experiences J &amp; I have had in SF in a loooong time. \u00a0Portions are perfect for 4-- enough to give everyone a satisfying taste of the dish while allowing for the group to order many dishes to try everything. \u00a0J &amp; I also thought that pricing was super reasonable, especially given the portion size (we expected bite sized bits that would be difficult to share). \u00a0Total damage for everything listed above plus a glass of viognier was around $150 (including tax+tip). \u00a0We would've been satisfied (and full) with half of what we ordered, and $40/person for top notch quality dinner in SF seems like a steal to me. \u00a0Totally staying/waking up early to make reservations for my next visit.",

A yummy bite! \u00a0That kraut salt is cool too! - Bone Marrow with Chanterelles and Pink Peppercorns - bone marrow was rich, but the bread was cut a bit too thick for my liking. \u00a0Personal preference: bread could be toasted more to counter balance the fattiness in the marrow. \u00a0Not a fan of whole pink peppercorns. \u00a0 - Bacon Curry with Sweetbreads - sweetbreads were cooked well and I loved the idea of sweetbreads and curry. Overall a good dish and concept, but not memorable (maybe a bit more spice to give it a real punch). Pickled squash was a nice touch. - Whole Grain Cheddar Pancake with Tomato and Garlic - ate well, but wasn't special. \u00a0Wasn't a fan.  The passed dim-sum style specials had some hits (smoked trout avo dip, duck liver mousse with mini corn cakes), but also misses too (mushroom dumpling, melon salad, oysters). \u00a0The special Guanciale Chawanmushi we got was pretty scrambled, but still tasted ok. \u00a0I'm not going to get in to them because I'm sure they change frequently. \u00a0  Service was excellent; the staff was super-attentive and nice. \u00a0Overall, we ate 13 dishes, and it came out to $110, which is more than reasonable. \u00a0The dim sum style service definitely has prices that won't drain your wallet to leave full and satisfied.  With all the hype surrounding this, I had higher expectations on the food, but overall still solid. \u00a0The place is super fun, and it's a great and unique service style (dim sum style service with carts and trays of tapas plates). \u00a0The food is non-pretentious and pretty straight-forward. \u00a0It's a must-try for first-timers for the experience.  Bonus tip: Do yourself a favor and show up at least by 4 pm (bring something to pass the time) so you have a good chance to get in by the first seating.",

My expectations were met and then some!  We didn't have reservations and got to the line at 5:00, about 12 people deep by then. We missed the first wave of walk ins, but enjoyed cocktails at Yoshi's-who mentioned how they've had more bar customers since SBP opened. :) We were seated at the chef's counter by 7:15 and enjoyed every minute of sitting up close to the action. Everyone, from the owner to the chefs to our waitress and the hostess, was extremely helpful throughout the whole meal.  We tried 10 different things before we filled our bellies to the brim, enjoying each one. We especially loved the quail, kimchi pancake, sweetbread meatball and burrata (of course :)). Interesting, but we could have passed on the pork ear strings.  In the end, it came to $70 each (went with my bf) including the $20 corkage, 10 items and tip. The bf was just as excited to try each dish as I was and we both can't wait to go back!",

    "review_text": "I had New Year's Eve dinner here with some friends...a group of 5 of us. \u00a0This is a new venture from the chefs from Rubicon. \u00a0After talking to our server, it sounds like a lot of other staff followed them also. \u00a0  When you walk in, don't be confused by the open kitchen that dominates the front of the restaurant...walk a little further in, &amp; someone will help you. \u00a0  So, you get a menu for drinks, then they leave a ticket at your table. \u00a0The meal works dim sum style, meaning they will bring trays/carts of the food around, and you pick out what you want as they come around, &amp; they mark the ticket with a hash mark. \u00a0Oh, they do tell you what the dish is, unlike dim sum, where you generally have to ask if you don't know.  We were the gluttons who ordered two of every dish that came out (17 savory dishes &amp; 4 sweet) so that everyone at the table could try everything! \u00a0We thought there were only going to be 10-11 savory dishes, but they just kept on coming...  Here's their menu from online. \u00a0We pretty much had all of the savories &amp; then some that weren't on the list (pork ribs, caviar &amp; chips, chocolate cherry mistake). \u00a0We didn't have all of the desserts on the list, so I deleted those. \u00a0 crudite with goat cheese &amp; toasted sesame tofu with lime, ginger &amp; fennel pickled wild mushrooms with root purees &amp; hazelnuts chicken 'salad' with buddha's hand &amp; celery root curd sourdough kraut ricotta &amp; pecorino pancakes 'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravy carnitas stuffed squid rye bread &amp; red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish-ale cream smokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurt fried quail with lemon stewed onions \u00a0(yes, they serve their namesake here; makes sense, doesn't it?) fragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey &amp; pommegranate roasted carrots &amp; braised jammy greens crispy chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayon peanut muscovado milk clove spiked fig cookies  Everything was spot on...I had lunch with one of my friends who was at that dinner today, &amp; we were talking about how the every dish was solid with innovative flavor combinations.  They offer wine &amp; beer, &amp; tea. \u00a0Our group actually didn't have any alcohol &amp; did our drinking later in the evening.  D\u00e9cor is simple, minimalist...the wall we were sitting against was a pegboard.  Service was very good...staff was pleasant, professional, yet friendly.  There's a single room unisex restroom at the back.   Located on the west side of Fillmore, between Geary &amp; OFarrell. \u00a0The storefront is narrow, &amp; there's no signage (at least not on the night I went), so I walked right past it at first.",

    "review_text": "So, I'm fairly dim when it comes to dim sum. I don't claim to be a foody by any means, and the more descriptors thrown at me upon presentation the worse I am at remembering wtf I ate just was. I've had trouble remembering what I've choosen in the past even when a full on, fancy audio visual cart was used. This fusion of tasting choices started in a traditional manner sit down dinner manner; lighter fare-tofu salads and such started rolling first. \u00a0A second appetizeresque bowl of wild mushrooms with three dipping sauces was next; tasty, colorful and texture rich. The cart then came a rollin' with home style chips and a roe topped yogurt? sauce. \u00a0It was a good to keep on the side for palate cleansing between dishes. \u00a0Soon after, the heartier meats of the matter came through. Duck neck dumplings with a couple of tiny vertabrae intact (:-S) were up first. \u00a0I passed on the two veggie sums that followed and was pretty satisfied by the time the meaty stuff came back around but went ahead and finished up with some barley type thing. Service was abundant as waitstaff buzzed up and down the floor constantly. Overall, I think the experience would be best enjoyed with an eating partner, the dishes were big enough to share a few bites, and the time between choices could be filled with conversation. The decor itself seemed scant, and begged for a lived in look. The pegboard donned not only the wall, but the ceiling as well. Maybe they should post pics of what they have to keep people like me from wondering, \"what's next?\"",

    "review_text": "I have been meaning to try this place for a while and I finally made it there this weekend. I also managed to score a reservation at a reasonable time which of course always helps! To start, my friend and I somehow timed it perfectly and got probably one of the best seats in the house - it was right where the servers come out from the kitchen so we got first dibs on dishes. Our waitress was very personable and helpful in explaining how the process works. We ordered drinks and also the ribs that are on the menu that do not come out with the servers. Then the fun began! Here are the items we selected from the passed dishes:  - Heirloom tomatoes w smoked salmon and sweet corn - Excellent flavors and combination. - Albacore mousse with pickled veggies and chicharones - Ok not one of my favorite dishes - Duck liver mousse w almond biscuits - LOVED the biscuits, the liver mousse flavor was great but a bit soft on the consistency - Quinoa w Ahi tuna - This was one of my favorite dishes and I don't even like quinoa! The flavors are layered and excellent together. - Spicey tomato sauce with egg and chantarelle mushrooms - sounded good but everything just kind of blended together and was kind of one note - Burrata with fried garlic bread - if you are a burrata fan then you will probably love this, it is a bit heavy but really good flavor - Dumplings with hen and shitake mushrooms - one of the just ok dishes, would not get again - Ribs - these were delicious and tender. A different flavor than I have ever tasted before on ribs, and I have had a lot of ribs! - Melon granita with ginger tapioca and berries - we were so full (very proud we managed to try 8 things between the 2 of us!) so we went with the lightest sounding dessert. Not fantastic but a fun and light dessrt which we enjoyed.  All of the servers were great and fun to talk to. They checked in on us without being intrusive and we never felt rushed. We really enjoyed the concept and will be back!",

A blow by blow is too difficult given the number of dishes and the time constraints of the meal, so here's my summary:  Signature dishes 1) Sourdough pancakes (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GnSaPJx5z80pT97ahCQpsg&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - After devouring one, understood why it is a signature. \u00a0If you're a bread person, you'll like this.  2) State Bird (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GS-hwtU-ghcMiMJNs0vtCA&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Think mini fried chicken (it's quail though) with pickled onions. \u00a0Can't get more deliciously crispy than this.  Highlights 3) \u00a0Pork belly - Melted in my mouth and softened my guilt with a grape leaf salad. \u00a0Forgot to click my camera on this one.  4) \u00a0Crab dip &amp; salsa with homemade chips (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GS-hwtU-ghcMiMJNs0vtCA&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Remember that Lays chip commercial, betcha can't just eat one? \u00a0That's how addictive these are and with crab dip that had a perfect texture, not too creamy.  5) \u00a0Black sesame ice cream sandwich (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9oRhYQhfrXCXPzj85GaNgg&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - A fellow diner commented that the cookie reminded her of sesame cookies from Taiwan. \u00a0Did somebody say 'ice cream'?  6). Peanut shot (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mcE3aQEgMFecwciTHk_9Gg&amp;userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>) - Think mini peanut milk shake.  Plus With the number of offered dishes, it's amazing how they are able to present such a variety of flavors without being repetitious, unique in their own way. \u00a0They are also innovators in giving you choices between the set menu items and the 'dim sum' style served foods that are offered as the servers walk the room.  Minus Due to the crowds and long line, a diner may feel obligated to somewhat rush his/her meal as a courtesy to both the waiting customers and the restaurant. \u00a0If you are looking for a leisure dinner with conversation, this probably is not a good choice. \u00a0We were in and out of the restaurant in about 90 minutes, amazing considering that we had about sixteen courses not counting desserts.  You may wonder why the change in the review format. \u00a0I couldn't remember the descriptions and names of every item that we ate. \u00a0Age is catching up with me... what's your name again?! Overall, the experience was five solid stars. \u00a0From our gracious hosts (inside connections), the special perks (complimentary glass of bubbly and meeting the chef), the service (courteous and efficient... plus a familiar face from another Michelin restaurant up north), and the food, amazing varying flavor profiles! \u00a0Just wished that I could remember more about it. \u00a0 Will I be back? \u00a0You can bet on it, but hopefully when my mind is in a better state.",

Went to the web site and had trouble making reservations so we took a chance and showed up at opening to a line out the door.  It turns out they hold a third of the seating for walk ups but you need to put in your name ahead of time. We were able to get one of the last time slots of the day (10:45) which was late but we really wanted to try it.  Before I get to the food the real stars of this place is the staff. A place of this kid of demand could have a stuffy staff but no. The host was as kind and accommodating as could be. I'm sure she gets a lot of people upset with not getting in or seating so late but you would not know it she is like a ball of sunshine.  The wait staff including our waitress was also friendly and really explained the food and showed a great deal of pride in the work of the restaurant. I wish this group could train other staffs.  The food was wonderful and familiar while still being creative. We went a little overboard sampling every dish that came by and ordering off the menu but it was worth it. The rabbit and potato salad really was the highlight for me. This place can be as expensive or reasonable as you want it to be if you have the will power to do so.  Worth the wait.",

    "review_text": "I had to really spend some time considering how many stars to give this place but finally settled with a solid three. Now before you start the barrage of diatribes, I'd like to first state my case.   I, as well as any person in SF not living under a rock, has heard of State Bird Provisions before really even knowing anything about the place. Bon App\u00e9tit Magazine even named SBP its Best New Restaurant for 2012. My preconceived notion was that this place simply specialized in poultry, from fried to roasted to the hundred different variations seen from all types of restaurants across America. After dinner tonight, we realized that it couldn't be far from the truth.  Without any prior reservations in hand (not that we hadn't tried, it's just the SBP website NEVER HAD ANY RESERVATIONS AVAILABLE!), we arrived to a line about 25 people, at about 15 min. before opening time of 5:30pm. When we finally got to the maitre d', we were told that our table wasn't going to be ready until 2 hours later and was instructed to leave our cell phone number so as to be contacted when table was ready. Thank God we had free parking after 6pm and had Japantown conveniently located adjacent to the SBP. We killed time by sauntering in and around Japantown shops (Nijiya, a bookstore and stationary store). Showing up again at 7:15pm allowed us to sit at around 7:30pm.  Walking in, you get a very eclectic, San Francisco chic vibe (does that make sense?). The walls were adorned with vibrantly-colored construction paper cut to different shapes of cooking utensils. A concrete wall was the backdrop of one side of the space, with neatly-framed pictures rustically hung with metal wire.   Meals were brought out by various waiters/waitresses in the same fashion as dim sum carts and trays, accompanied by a thorough explanation of ingredients and method used to cook the dish. Dishes varied from $3 - $10, but the key was to know that the majority of the dishes were small appetizer sizes.   After reviewing the menu, turns out their signature dish was, in fact, quail, our great state's official bird. I wasn't up to gnoshing on an animal whose taste I wasn't particularly fond of. Instead I opted for inventive dishes never before imagined:   Savory: raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame ** shiitake, persimmon &amp; quinoa 'tabouleh' ** duck liver mousse with almond biscuit *** garlic bread with bur rata * trout roe chip &amp; dip ** hamachi-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker ** mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime glaze ** roasted bone marrow with chanterelles &amp; pink peppercorn ** wild king salmon tartare with fermented turnips ***  Dessert: chocolate roll cake, sesame mousse, seville orange-clove caramel ** 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk *  * \u00a0 don't bother ** \u00a0average/good enough *** exceptional  Above said dishes (including a few drinks that were totaled to less than $20) left us with a bill of about $150. Would I go back to SBP with local friends? Probably not. With out-of-town foodies? Sure. But this place is all about hype. Quality of food will not blow your mind. Maybe my expectations are too high. But for a $150 meal between two people on a Wed night after a two-hour wait, not worth it.  Thanks for the experience, SBP. It was fun while it lasted.",

It's \"dim sum style\" service.....I really like this concept. \u00a0Considering the chefs have Michelin Star backgrounds, you can basically tailor a very sophisticated tasting menu to your personal desires. \u00a0Feel free to pass on dishes that don't sound great to your tastes...you won't regret it because you could never eat the entire menu. \u00a0So, pick well and enjoy. \u00a0  On this topic...save a little appetite for dessert. \u00a0Their pastry program is insane!!! \u00a0I lean toward savory but holy sh*t, they knock it out of the park with their desserts. \u00a0We've had friends licking bowls....a little embarrassing but booze does bring out the dog in most of us. \u00a0I digress...  On to cost...there are a few approaches you can take here. \u00a0If you have a Fillmore show or movie to catch...you can nail a few dishes and a beer and get out of there lightly scathed since most options cost between $4-$8. \u00a0You can also go in a small group (4 works well) and order 2 of everything that sounds good to the group and hit their wine list. \u00a0There are lots of interesting wine options under 40 bucks. \u00a0This is where the value really is, considering the experience. \u00a0The last time we ate this way, we had a couple hour food journey with lots of wine and only spent about $60 per person. \u00a0Now compare that to Commonwealth, Sons &amp; Daughters, etc. \u00a0I have a hard time separating them when comparing food only. \u00a0Albeit, the atmosphere is a lot nicer at the aforementioned restaurants but I don't really rank atmosphere as high when dining out (personally).  Alright, I'll put the pom poms down but I really like this restaurant and will go back again soon.",

Fried pork belly with jalape\u00f1os and citrus - prob second best dish to me tonight. The citrus and jalepenos flavors come out nicely.   Garlic break with barrata - interesting texture for both. The bread tastes different and chewy but no garlic flavor and only pepper.   Hen dumpling - waited forever for this. The broth is different and very salty. I would not pay $3 for this one piece.   Chocolate ice cream sandwich - super hard and the brownies are too chewy.   Hamachi, avocado and seaweed cracker - the best dish of the day. Nicely decorated.   Mushroom risotto porridge - it's nice and mild but it's worthy of $8.   Duck mousse almond biscuit - no almond flavors but the duck mousse is unique. However they don't come well together.   Spicy drunkenness crab kimchi yuba - just kimchi stir fried with a tiny piece of crab and mostly yuba (fu zhu) which is curb bean sheet. $13. Super pricy and not that good.",

Luckily for me, I live on the East Coast and therefore only had to wake up at 7am, exactly 2 months to the day, before we wanted to eat here. My friends thanked me immensely for not forcing them awake at 4am.   We had an 8:30 reservation, but got there quite early so asked the hostess for recommendations for cocktails nearby. She was extremely helpful and friendly, and pointed us in the right direction. Around 8:15 we come back and end up waiting around 30 minutes for our table because apparently they are just sitting on their check. Not cool. Although as other reviewers mentioned, it may have been because they were rushed through their meal? Moral of the story: come later.   Our group of 4 decided to bring 2 bottles of our own wine, since the corkage was a decently reasonable $25 per bottle for the first 2 bottles ($35 each for an additional 2 bottles). Coming with a group was also a good decision because we were able to try a lot of things. I am going to spare you the details of everything we ate, but my favorites were:  -guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth (order one per person)  -trout roe chip &amp; dip (I loved! Luckily for my, my friends did not)  -pork belly grape salad -sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancake   Definitely try the state bird (fried quail), and the oysters were also delicious. I am pretty open to trying everything once, so we did try the duck pate. Still not my thing and would probably never order again, but you live and you learn.   When we first sat down, they definitely seemed to be bringing us our dishes at a very fast pace. However, as we were trying to have a leisurely dinner and really enjoy our food, we often told them to come back a little later. They had no problem doing so, and it made our dinner a lot more enjoyable. At one point we also asked our server if they needed our table, but she said as long as we were still eating, we were welcome to take our time.   Also noteworthy, one of the owners was working, and he was more than happy to answer any questions we had. He even came back later and talked to my friend a little more extensively, which really went above and beyond.   Overall, the service and food were both impeccable, and I hope to have another chance to dine here in the future!",

Tip: I made it on a Monday for Friday at 5:30pm of same week. \u00a0Wide open. \u00a0Lots of times to choose from. #2. \u00a0We arrived at 5:30pm when it opened to find a line stretching 20 people deep. \u00a0Mixed of folks with/without reservations. \u00a0Very confusing. We had to jump past some folks to reach the host. \u00a0Finally sat down at 5:50 pm. \u00a0I apologize if I inadvertently cut in front of anyone who also had a 5:30 pm reservation. #3. \u00a0Once seated, waited again before our server came over. \u00a0She explained the dim sum concept and the boarded items. \u00a0She took our drink orders and then we waited some more to see what might come by.  I like how the dim sum concept has been westernized. \u00a0Carts or trays of small plates. You can yay or nay to any item. \u00a0The price of each plate is identified so no surprises. \u00a0  Pros - 1) fun. 2) various food items; freedom to select or not from carts and trays. \u00a03) the ability to order off the menu also. \u00a0This is where the state bird offering is. \u00a04) fresh seasonal items 5) yin and yang food ingredients.  Cons - 1) an item may not reach your table so then you have to wait to see if it'll come around again during your dining interval. 2) The haphazard check in process at 5:30pm when the place opens. \u00a0I know folks w/o reservations are trying to get one of the counter seats but it's organized chaos.  We were very pleased with everything we consumed. \u00a0The hightlight was the state bird = quail. \u00a0We started with 1/2; then order another 1/2 later on. The second time was better cuz we knew what to expect.  Nice service. \u00a0Friendly staff.  $82.00 food and drinks before tax and tip.",

    "review_text": "The restaurant just wasn't up to the hype. One of the biggest weaknesses of the place is that some of the off-the-menu items were not all offered to the table when you are there. But one could request it from the kitchen if you know what you want. So one always feels like you are missing out somehow. For instance, the burrata on garlic bread looked great that another table ordered, but we never got to try it since we saw it at the end of the meal. The restaurant was incredibly loud, reminding me of one of those trendy restaurants in NYC, where one can't hear the waitress who is trying to communicating the special of the day (in this case, what's in the cart), except that everyone is a lot more casually dressed and the wall hangings are a bit too apocalyptic for my taste.  some of the best dishes: lobster crouton with lobster salsa on top. Fresh, perfectly cooked lobster steeped in a lovely sauce, which is a lot less sour than the usual ceviche sauce.  dungeness crab with farro: farro produced a texture that almost reminded me an in-between of risotto and steel-cut oats, not too creamy, with fabulous aroma, and topped with big chunks of crab.  CA state bird -- fried quail, the signature dish. Very good, light crusted with tender moist quail. Half portion is enough for two for a taste.  The other ones: Smoked Sturgeon -- this was a winner at my table, especially for the people who like smoke salmon lox bagel. I think of it as a riff on that dish, a much more refined version of it, with sturgeon whose texture is cooked to perfection.   Boudin noir / blood sausage -- average, especially for a person who was never that into boudin noir in France.  Kimchi on top of tofu skin -- not sure what the big deal is, if you have tasted a shanghai dish with pickeled mustard green with tofu skin and soybean, you would not be impressed.  Sea urchin pancake -- I like the sea urchin, but the amount of sea urchin to pancake was too small to satisfy the sea urchin lover's palate.  Pork Belly dish // Short rib dish -- same genre, average. My favorite pork belly is still momofuku noodle bar's pork belly bun. this one is just not as tender.   Earl grey, cocoa nib, almond ice cream sandwich -- the best dessert, not too sweet  oyaki (japanese bean cake) with some sauce -- interesting combination. average  chocolate souffle cheesecake -- unusual texture. I liked the chunks of chocolate that sometimes one happens to catch in a spoonful of the dessert. It's having a bit of an identity crisis though, not as rich as a chocolate souffle, and not as creamy as a cheesecake.  Gosh, we did eat a lot for the four of us, had a bottle of wine and 2 pots of coffee. $60-70/person which is quite reasonable.  I highly commend the chefs on being experimental and constantly combining various elements of multiple cuisines every day/week/month. But part of the downside is that the quality may be inconsistent across dishes. As long as one doesn't care and want to experiment with the chef, one should try this place out (when the hype dies down a bit and when it's a bit easier to get a reservation).",

It is very hard to get a reservation these days- and the line is so long if you don't have one- but it's worth it. The state bird (their namesake dish) is not to be missed! So deliciously fried. Also, the sturgeon pancakes were to die for. Also, if they have a dish with some sort of smoked potato component- get it! Their menu changes all the time, but I had two different dishes (on different occasions) that had a smokey potato element- and they were both so unusual and amazing. I'm a big fan of the garlic bread with burrata- though some of the people I dined with weren't as into it. It reminds me of a grown up, gourmet version of round table's bread sticks.

So you might have heard, State Bird's menu constantly changes. When you sit down you can pick some menu listed items and/or you can take your chances and roll the dice with the randoms that come from the kitchen. Each tray brings a new surprise and the wait staff won't spoil the mystery (shhhhh).

If I were to arrive early to snatch a 5:30 table, I need to be there early. \u00a0In fact, so prepared and so early that I found myself standing outside the no-sign restaurant alone for a good half an hour before the next wave of people came. \u00a0By then, at 4:30, people started to come in large waves. Not everyone is seated at 5:30, of course, even though the newly renovated space allocated about half of the tables for walk-ins. \u00a0Some received later times. \u00a0The last ones were turned away.   Of course, after 90 minutes of wait, I was beyond excited to eat, or mostly just excited to sit. The place is very cute and energetic. \u00a0Everyone working there seems so happy. \u00a0There is a menu where you can order some dishes, while the rest are being walked around on trays by waiters --- \u00a0truly dim sum style. \u00a0  It's exciting to eye the food coming your way. \u00a0The unpredictability --- \u00a0will they run out before they reach your table?, makes you almost giddy. \u00a0And the selection is overwhelming. \u00a0We had to decide what NOT to get --- that's the hard part, when there are so many choices. \u00a0Uni pancake-- definitely. Brussel sprouts -- maybe next time. \u00a0  Some of the highlights were surprises. \u00a0Like the rabbit croquette. \u00a0And the quinoa with persimmon and shiitake mushroom. \u00a0Really really good.   Others didn't match the hype. \u00a0Like the state bird was tender and juicy but perhaps a little too greasy for us. \u00a0And the way they described the mushroom dumplings made it sound like a little spoon of heaven. But I thought it was a bit bland.   Our waitress's eyes sparkled talking about the half dozen quail eggs. And they were indeed quite special. \u00a0runny yolks, tart apple, creamy mt.tam. \u00a0Strange combo but just worked. \u00a0And the burrata and bread dish ran out a few times right before reaching our table. so it was nice to finally get it and try the strange concept of garlic knots with savory cheese. \u00a0Really good, but came in at a time where our bellies were beyond full.   Just like any dim sum restaurants, at a certain point, you need to know when to quit. \u00a0So we stopped and split the chocolate dessert, which came out looking like a piece of meatloaf. \u00a0Cute and inventive, but I was hoping for something more traditional.   Service is obviously fast since there is virtually no wait time between order and eat. \u00a0And price is surprisingly affordable. \u00a0How many dishes did we get? Can't remember, but we only spent about $100 for two without drinks. \u00a0hardly counts as a fancy, special-occasion dinner, right? But the experience was certainly different and memorable, which makes it a great \"last chance for grown up dinner for two\" for me!",

Every single dish was mind-blowing impressive and truly helped explained the line-waiting, insane reservation lead-time hype. \u00a0Honestly, you can't go wrong with the dim sum here-- it's more a matter of personal preference!  I will definitely be back.....if I'm, God bid, able to!!! (note to self: make a reservation now for my visit in 4 months)",

    "review_text": "I really wanted to like this place, as I've heard so many good things, but after paying way too much for leaving still hungry, I was very disappointed.  The wait for this place is out of control. I got there right when it opened and was told there was a 2.5 hour wait. I understand that it is a tiny restaurant, but then why have a reservation system at all? It would work better to have a walk-in-only establishment.  I was seated around 8pm and ordered quickly, since I was starving. While I waited for my food, various servers came up to me and thrust dishes in my face. They described them and would insist that I eat them, looking disappointed if I didn't oblige. I could barely have a conversation with my friend because I kept being interrupted by them and it got annoying quickly. Many of the dishes did look good, but they were so tiny that they didn't seem worth the $8-$10 price tag, so I only ordered one small plate that was indeed, so small that I could barely enjoy it.  The crab farro was not worth its $20 price tag - it was small and lacked seasoning. I had to ask for salt and pepper and got a dirty look when I did. The sturgeon pancake, however, was delicious, and I only wish I had ordered 2 or 3 of those and called it a night. Everything was expensive, so I left without trying dessert and ate another dinner at home since I was still hungry.  State Bird has a lot of potential, and I can see it being a really great place. But if it wants to have a successful dim sum concept, it needs to be a bigger restaurant and it needs to appreciate that its diners are waiting 2-3 hours to eat there. Not once did anyone ever acknowledge me for waiting so long or offer me anything complimentary or otherwise, which was a total letdown. It didn't feel very hospitable to me, and I was very disappointed.",

    "review_text": "Wahh. I was seriously hoping that I would be able to give this place a 5 star rating, but unfortunately, that would require for me to break the Golden Rule of Yelp. Thou shall not lie on Yelp.   While the food probably would've earned them a solid 3 stars, the service sucked ass. Let's start with the wait. My dear friends got there at 5pm to line up for a spot. Of course, we made the rookie mistake of having a large party of 6. Now, I wasn't there to witness this, but from what I heard, my friends were told to step aside while the hostess tried to figure out our situation for 6. Meanwhile, the people behind us got on the list ahead of us. No biggie about that though, we eventually got on the list even if it meant dinner at 9:45.  At 8:40, I decided that I simply couldn't wait any longer. Here's where the State Bird Provisions staff failed to impress. The hostess was unwilling to accommodate. When we told her that we would go from 6 people to 5, she gave us a really hard time. Telling us that a table was ready for us, even though this was the first we've heard of this and we didn't receive the promised text. To avoid any issues, I decided to stay for dinner. It literally took less than a minute to let her know that it will be 6 after all, but apparently that wasn't quick enough, because we've lost our chance at the table. Funny though, we stood by the door and no one was taken back to be seated at the table that was ready. Then the hostess unpleasantly asked us if we would be open to splitting up because we would have a better chance to getting a table sooner. Otherwise, we would have a table for 6 at 9:45. We said sure, we're open to splitting up, but if we're waiting till the end, we'd like to sit together. It was a celebratory dinner for my friend who's back in town from med school after all!  We were seated roughly at 10:05, making us the very last group to be seated. No apologies for seating us 20 minutes later the initial 9:45 timeline. In fact, the hostess acted like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. If we were 20 minutes late, we certainly would've lost our table. But you know, this is our time vs. State Bird Provisions time. By the look of things, they have no consideration for their customer's time at all.   On top of that, she split up our group. She had the nerve to say \"This is what we were talking about, remember?\" NO. We don't remember. Don't try to play us like this is what you've been telling us this whole time. It just seems like she would rather split us up and not let us sit at the large table because that would mean we would have to wait a bit longer and all of the staff would have to stay later. I'm pretty sure that all of us couldn't have misheard. I can honestly say that my interaction with the hostess was one of the most unpleasant experience I've had with anyone in the service industry. She had a fake smile on her face when she talked to you and would literally scowl when you walked away. #thoushallnotlieonyelp  How about the food? I'm not even going to go into detail about that because my experience was so terrible. Let's just say that the food is their saving grace, but certainly not good enough to redeem them from the horrible service. The flavoring wasn't so unique for my Asian palate. In fact, my tastes buds recognized most of the flavors - although admittedly, I'm used to them in a different form and consistency.  I'm likely never going to be back again.",

    "review_text": "This place is amazing. I took my best friend here for her birthday last Friday. \u00a0I booked the reservation through UrbanSpoon ten days beforehand and barely snagged a 10p reservation. \u00a0Not an ideal time for dinner, but glad we went anyway. \u00a0I did receive a text around 9:30p that the table was ready but we already had obligations. \u00a0  This place was easy to find and the front is not pretentious. \u00a0The open kitchen was casual and people seemed to enjoy working there. \u00a0Nobody was stressed because they cook one dish and split it between three plates. \u00a0If you order an entree off the menu, they will have the two leftover plates and go around the tables to see if anyone wants to try them as well. \u00a0This is ingenious since you get to try a lot more dishes (I love variety) and each dish is something I've never tasted before.  1) \u00a0Quinoa tuna tartare - we almost passed on this since it was the first thing offered in person on the tray, but we decided to try it. \u00a0They had uncooked quinoa sprinkled on top that gave it a nice crunch and the rosemary aoili wasn't overpowering and was fresh and perfect. \u00a0This was one of our favorite dishes of the night and was quite inspiring (I'm adding quinoa to my tar tar recipe!).  2) \u00a0Guanciale and ramp short stack with candy cap powder (and balsamic vinaigrette) - this was pretty good. \u00a0The flavors were sweet and salty and the pancake gave it substance so it was to my liking.  3) \u00a0State Bird with sour provisions - fried quail with a white sauce that was a bit sour for the both of us. \u00a0We didn't finish this dish. \u00a0It was a flop, kinda like when you're watching a movie and the characters state the movie title in a cheesy line.  4) \u00a0Braised beef and beet salad with bone marrow sauce ($18!) - It came with four very well executed beef cheeks that were tender and separated with little effort. \u00a0The fat from the bone marrow set off the lack of fat on the clean piece of beef. \u00a0However, the beets could've been cooked a little more and the salad was a bit flat for me.  5) \u00a0Whipped trout with fava beans and croutons - This was served in a Korean side dish dish (if that makes sense). \u00a0That's why it reminded me of home. \u00a0But these flavors did not. \u00a0I would skip this dish. \u00a0Good for one teaspoon just to taste, but that's about it.  6) \u00a0Pork farro with ramps and a soft egg - this is their version of bi bim bop. \u00a0Loved it. \u00a0The greens really set off the fatty and savory pork and the fatter, shorter rice grains were a perfect texture and size to offset that of the pork. \u00a0  7) \u00a0Green garlic bread with burrata (mozzarella) - pretty good but might get you really full. \u00a0I wish there was a place that served this dish! \u00a0The bread is the shape and form of a cinnamon roll with no cinnamon though and the mozzarella is soft and liquid-like on the inside of the glop of cheese. \u00a0There are spices on top that make this dish phenomenal (reminded me of the spices on the Mediterranean bread at Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder in Lincoln Park).  8) \u00a0World Peace peanut muscovado milk in a shotglass - unfortunately, I ate the ice cream sandwich portion before I drank the milk so it just tasted like lukewarm milk to me. \u00a0I recommend drinking this BEFORE you dabble in any of the other desserts.  9) \u00a0Strawberry granita (grainier than a sorbet), small, white and clear tapioca balls and hard, candied dates - I love dates but not in this dish. \u00a0The dates were hard to chew and got stuck on my molars. \u00a0The granita was pretty good, but would pass on this one next time.  10) Chocolate walnut ice cream sandwich and dulce de leche - this was my favorite since the chocolate was a bit unfinished and tasty. \u00a0It came out in finger-like portions and was very good. \u00a0Order it!   I had the Snap Dragon Iced Tea and it was nothing but regular iced tea, not spiced or anything special. \u00a0I recommend the Lemon Basil soda, which was pretty good.  The service was excellent. \u00a0The Indian gal took care of the bill, but most of the time it was the waiter in the paisley shirt with the curly longer hair or the younger, tall guy with brown hair in all black. \u00a0The younger guy with brown hair (wish I got his name to put on this review!), was great with his recommendations and was super friendly (not to mention really cute).   Definitely would come back (especially since the menu changes)!",

WOULD ORDER AGAIN:  - State Bird Provision (my favorite dish of the evening; amazing crispy texture and great flavor) - Garlic Bread with Burrata (a little greasy, but worth the calories) - Crispy Pork Belly (refreshing version of fob roasted pork belly with fish sauce)  - Guinea Hen Dumpling (not what I expected, but I like the flavors and textures with the broth)  GOOD AND WORTH A TRY:  - Chawan Mushi (porky and saucy version of steamed Japanese egg custard) - Beets with Goat Cheese (standard but good) - Salmon Dip (a bit fishy but fun) - Chanterelle Toast (perfect for mushroom lovers) - Chilli-Charred Broccoli (very simple but done well) - Duck Liver Mousse (mousse was great but the biscuits too heavy and dense for my tastes) - Quince Granita with Coconut Tapioca (cool texture, and I love the added anise/licorice flavor from the fennel stalks) - Peanut muscovado milk (for $2, why not?)  NEVER AGAIN:  - Bone Marrow (bland with gummy rubbery texture)  The food was interesting enough that the bf and I will definitely make it a point to return to SBP when we're in SF, but only if we're able to get another reservation. I can't honestly say it was good enough that I would wait in line for an hour without a reservation.  SBP is so hipster that they don't even need a sign. Just look for the white people.",

Dinner: So the dinner is like dim sum, but not asian food. The servers come around with a tray of small portions of simply delicious bowls of goodness. \u00a0The food that I've had here is awesome.   Here's a quick list of the items I loved:  Garlic Bread with burrata raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame Guinea Hen Dumpling with aromatic broth Crunchy Quinoa-Hass Avocado with lime pickle yogurt Tuna Crudo &amp; Confit with chickpeas &amp; cumin Ricotta Dumplings with spring onion &amp; sunflower seeds\\ CA state bird with provisions  Each dish ranges from about $5-$8 so it's really reasonable to try so many incredible dishes for such a great price.   If I were to break it down: Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 4.5 stars (casual, but cute and quirky) Food: 5+ stars  Overall: 5 stars - Can't wait to come back again!",

Cool, quirky, hipster, lively with the staff walking around trying to \"sell you\" some dim sum. At least the prices of each item are nice and big so they don't surprise you with anything.  Many of the \"dim sum\" items we ordered might not be offered when you go because they change frequently. I noticed, however, that they do tend to consistently offer some of their \"staples. \"  The Do's of State Bird - Guinea hen dumping. By far my favorite dish. I could eat that broth for dayyyyys -Scotch egg- pretty filling. Soft egg surrounded by pork  -Duck confit fried rice- off the menu  -Burrata with garlic bread  -Yuzu persimmons- I love yuzu and persimmons so creating a dish with both those flavors is going to be a win for me.   The Maybe You Can Do Them's -State Bird (signature dish)- off the menu. Really small for what you get but good. Nothing spectacular though in my opinion.  -Crab yuba (tofu skin) - off the menu. Something about this dish was just a little off. It has kim chee so I expected it to be a little vinegary but there was barely any crab flavor  -Smoked trout gelee with uni foam- good but also kinda weird. Did not taste the uni at all   The Don'ts  -Pickled Vegetables- I think we ordered this as an attempt to incorporate more vegetables in our meal, but I wouldn't order these again  -Peppered pork- salty  -Ice cream sandwich- super overhyped. The pastry \"sandwich\" was kinda doughy and neither crispy nor flaky, which is how I like pastry to be   For 4 people, the bill came out to about $65 per person. I think this is on the lower end of the spectrum, so definitely be prepared to pay more. This is a cool place to try once, but I'm not sure how often I'd want to go through the hassle of eating here, if ever again.",

I know it sounds crazy, that's because it is. And I can't event believe i'm saying this but--IT'S WORTH IT. 2) Bread rolls with burrata. Words would not do this godly creation justice--but it's perfection. order it now. 3) Pork belly 4) They allow you to order a \"half dessert\" it's amazing. So now you can order half of everything. 5) You will leave FULL because of the dim sum \"eyes-are-bigger-than-my-stomach-syndrome.\" 6) I felt that for everything we got (including an $80 bottle of wine) the bill was surprisingly lower than I would have been willing to pay for such a delicious meal.  I want to go back again and again and again. (and i'll get smart and order at least 3 of those bread/burrata things)",

The vibe was fun, everyone anxious to finally dine at this Fillmore highlight - guests around us in line and inside were buzzing with excitement. The true gem of the place is the chance to do dim sum unlike anywhere else. This is not Chinese food being carted around but unique twists of American dishes.  The food is all good, nothing I found to be spectacular but food was solid and tasty. My favorite was off the menu - the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino, and ricotta pancakes. Sadly, the renowned CA state bird with provision dish was way underwhelming.   I recommend ordering the pancakes and then having fun with the dim sum that comes around. End the meal with whatever flavor ice cream sandwiches are being featured. We got luck with sesame ice cream sandwiches and they were delicious.",

Tip: Ended up checking for reservations a few times a day when walking to meetings and such and was able to score one after the second or third day. Our reservation was for 5:30, right when they open, and the line was more than 25 deep by the time we arrived. We were sat promptly and greeted by the nice server.   I love the dim-sum style of dining, lots of fun small plates, and you get to see them before ordering! While our dinner dates were a little less adventurous, we pushed them to try a few different things, we ended up ordering:   * State Bird with provisions (menu) - crispy and tasty  * Pancakes with sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta (menu) - doughy, yummy, unique  * Hamachi avocado and seaweed cracker - one of my favorites of the night, fresh fish, crispy seaweed cracker and flavorful sauces * Charred octopus in tomato-chickpea broth - perfectly cooked octopus  * Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits - velvety rich mousse with lightly sweetened biscuits  * Dumpling with aromatic broth - dumping shot, nice and light * Garlic bread with burrata - was looking forward to this but the bread was a bit tough * Pork ribs - tender and flavorful, the guys loved these  * Pork belly - crispy chunks of pork belly with jalape\u00f1os and grapes, yum * Lobster salad - fresh a light * Braised rabbit- another favorite of the night, tender pieces of rabbit cooked to perfection  * Dungeness crab and faro spezzato - rich, another favorite for the guys  * Tea ice cream sandwiches - unique dessert, not too sweet  Our server was great, very informative, without being pretentious, and was always happy to answer our questions.

It's great to be able to sit down and almost immediately get food options.

Anyway, the ahi tuna tartar with quinoa was good, the CA state bird (quail) was decent, and the fried garlic bread with burrata was amazing. The seafood salsa was okay but not amazing, and the spicy tofu skins were not spicy and kind of a weird texture (totally an opinion thing). We dined over those things plus a couple more for about an hour, and for some reason the servers STILL hadn't come and offered us the remaining 3-4 dishes, so even though we weren't totally full and would have been curious to see what other options there were, we didn't want to wait forever for them to notice and serve us.  This place is a cute idea. It has potential to be great. The main missing element is experienced, sophisticated service.",

If you're hoping to get a table right as they open or are a smaller group, I think lining up at around 4:30 or so should be good.  When they do open, the house has things down pat and move quickly to get people seated.The host does a great job of trying to accommodate day of reservations. I was very impressed with how smoothly things went.  Finally after much anticipation, foodz. The servers explain how it works: menu items, cart that comes by with the same items all night long, and then servers with trays stop by your table with items that rotate/change throughout the night. It was really weird getting used to the industrial, hip restaurant atmosphere with the totally Chinese dim sum serving style.  Dishes ordered: + Rock Cod fish sticks, these were okay. I would pass. +Quinoa Tabbouleh, very interesting textures and a nice preview of the night +Salmon tartare, hard to mess this up and sbp did it well +Smoked trout dip with house made chips, kind of like grown own tuna salad with chips. very good, recommend to get +'constructable' tuna tartare with seaweed crackers. highly, highly, highly recommend this dish. I could eat this dish the whole night and be very happy +Oysters on half shell, clean and sweet with a nice kick +state bird with provisions, the quail is breaded nicely and very moist. the provisions both heighten and cut the meat's richness +duck fried rice, fairly straight forward but still very good +dry aged beef, delicious little pieces of beef with a light chili garlic sauce and garlic chips +cumin lamb and squid, \u00a0cumin spiced tender lamb and squid pieces. not at all what i imagined it to be +pork belly and pickled plum, southeast asian flavors. the pork belly was meltingly tender and the plums provided a great hit of acid +roasted bone marrow, if you're a bone marrow fan GET THIS +steak tartare with rice cracker, overall nothing too out of the ordinary +olive oil ice cream sandwich, great dessert with tons of umami from the pecorino +chocolate mousse, very good dessert. both decadent and light.  we may have ordered a few other things that I forgot because that sort of happens at sbp. it's a whirlwind of flavors and exciting dishes and almost every item is sure to be very tasty. I'd highly recommend going with a group so you can try as much as you can.  Worth the hype and wait.",

They take a different approach to the restaurant experience by placing the kitchen at the forefront of the restaurant so you can see all the action!   The fact that the food comes by you dim sum style is great too - you don't have to think about what to order and you can see exactly what you are getting.

Mr Brioza and his whole team are extremely talented and have made the most balanced and complete place i have ever set foot on.   The pork belly was the best flavor my mouth has had. The texture, the sensation as I was chewing, the aroma of the vietnamese sauce, the perfectly measured spice of the jalapenos, the freshness of the mint. This is absolutely INCREDIBLE.

I had such high hopes for this place after reading about it in Bon Apetit and pretty much every other food related blog on the planet. It took me 2 months to get a reservation (which was at 10pm, the only time they had available). We were seated pretty much right away which was a plus, and judging by the other reviews not all that typical. The dishes we had ranged from bland to just plain bad. They are clearly trying to be inventive and original and in my opinion drastically failing. The food was just plain not very good. We had the short ribs, pancake, some sort of ahi tuna thing...nothing very memorable and not during a single bite was I impressed. My boyfriend felt the same. An additional annoyance was the lack of food they had available - maybe it was because it was later in the evening, but one guy with one cart with a few measly small plates on it just didn't do the job of serving an entire packed restaurant. Maybe my expectations were too high bc of all the hype - but I think when a restaurant is voted best new restaurant in America the food should be impressive. Especially considering all the amazing restaurants in SF I am just blown away that this place tops the charts.",

    "review_text": "State bird provisions is not only a meal but an experience. I walk by the restaurant quite frequently and there's almost always a line outside. You'd think they're selling the new iPhone in here. Right away I'd recommend that you make a reservation a couple days in advance if you're thining about getting dinner. They do set aside some tables for walk-in's but they're obviously first come first serve.   Let's start with the food. The menu is creative, unique and seems like the owner/head chef was inspired by the movie \"Chef\" meaning they're not going to serve the regular old stuff just cause they know it would sell. My date went with the Lamb and I went with the Sweet Breads. Both were excellent. SBP does something interesting where they serve tapas throughout dinner (dim sum style) that are off menu. We had several of those as well. The dinner entrees aren't too expensive at around $20 and apps at around $10, but the tapas is where things might get out of hand, ranging from $3 to double digits per tapa.  The service was fantastic. The servers are very helpful, knowledgable and not at all condoscending if you're not aware of a certain ingredient or dish. The other cool thing that SBP does is you can order with just about anyone in the restaurant. You'll have one main server but you could also order your food directly to a chef.   The environment is awesome. SBP is not the largest place but it serves around 100 people or so if I had to guess. The floor is split between booths and the bar that wraps around the open-air kitchen. We sat at the kitchen and I'd definitely recommend you do the same since it gives you the ability to soak in the cooking process and observe the energy of the kitchen. I thought it was pretty cool to watch our meals get prepared.   In conclusion, SBP has quite a bit of hype around it and it's well deserved. If you consider yourself a foodie with an open pallette then you must come here. Enjoy!",

    "review_text": "The perfect mix of creativity, skill, and laid back classiness can be found here - AND (unless you are a hopeless glutton) it won't cripple your piggybank either!  Although reservations FAR in advance are required for a table, showing up early (I arrived approx 40 mins and was first on line outside - sorry for the nose-prints &amp; drool-stains on the window, SBP!) and getting a spot at the chef's bar was by far more enjoyable I think (more on that later)..  It seems their \"Provisions\" menu (the part served dim sung style) is always evolving, so what follows is likely just a sample of what to expect: -- Avocado, guanciale &amp; pomelo (bite sized bits - a nice introduction!) -- Halibut tartare &amp; quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli  -- haas avocado with seafood 'salsa' -- duck neck dumplings in sauerjus -- pickled veggies, smoked potato &amp; egg -- green garlic bread with burrata  PACE YOURSELF with the dim sung, it's easy to just grab each item the first time it comes around, but that may leave you full faster than you anticipate.   The last item there (burrata) was the most enjoyable to watch being prepared; it was in fact a fried garlic bread dough in the shape of a doughnut with the burrata served in the middle. DELICIOUS!  I couldn't stand one of the flavors in the pickled veggies and egg (my personal taste, not their mistake), and when the gracious server inquired about my barely-touched-plate, they took it back &amp; removed it from my bill. \u00a0THAT is the mark of a restaurant that cares. \u00a0The server was so helpful and patient in explaining each dish, the pride in their creations were blatantly evident without being pompous.   The \"Commandables\" menu are items you must order and are then promptly cooked. I enjoyed both the pork ribs with spigarello &amp; togarashi as well as the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancakes.   STAND at the chefs bar - not only does this grant you first dibs on the dim sung cart (don't fear, table dwellers - all the dishes are equally perfect quality, choosing last doesn't mean a loss of quality, but choosing first DOES mean you're guaranteed to get stuff before it runs out. They DO keep going around with stuff though, so don't despair!) but standing and watching these careful artists at their work is entertainment enough. \u00a0I wasn't even thinking about the burrata until I watched this delicious dough fried up, and after the liberal shower of Parmesan grated that followed, the only thing keeping me from reaching over and just snatching one were the sharp knives in the chefs' hands.   Aside from being first-dibs or watching creations, as the pace of the evening slowed down from the hectic prepping and a la carte orders, the staff turned around and were open to conversation. THIS was my favorite part of SBP - upon finding out I was traveling alone from NY, a few staff easily opened up and told their own stories of living/working in the city. The conversations drifted from the demise of Brooklyn (goddamn hipsters), to the Picasso(?) tattoos on their arms, to the thoughts and inspirations behind the selections available that night.   During the course of the conversation, I put the fate of my dessert in their capable hands and was not steered wrong.  -- milk chocolate sesame crunch with clementine cocoa jam  -- chocolate-coconut 'ice cream' sandwich, pecan strudel --pineau des charentes (DELICIOUS butterscotch taste)",

June 4, 2014: \u00a0Took another, longer nap June 5, 2014: \u00a0Called friend in L.A. (\"Pepper\") to ask if she wanted to wait around in line for an hour to eat food at hot, trendy restaurant in SF. \u00a0Pepper agreed enthusiasically June 5, 2014: \u00a0Contemplated my life. \u00a0Query whether slacker friends are enabling me. June 6, 2014: \u00a0Took a nap but woke up halfway through to eat brownies June 19, 2014: \u00a0Prepared for SBP dinner by working out, then taking a nap.  June 20, 2014: \u00a0TODAY IS THE DAY! \u00a0SBP opens at 5:30.  4:15 PM: \u00a0Arrive at State Bird Proviions. \u00a0There's no sign but we see a line of people who look like they would wait in line for overhyped food. \u00a0Get in line behind 2 other parties who are already waiting in line. \u00a0  4:18 PM: \u00a0Get bored. \u00a0Chat with other people who are waiting in life, who are all CHEFS. \u00a0Good sign. \u00a0Watch the chefs inside work, \u00a0get more hungry. \u00a0Drool.  4:20 PM: \u00a0Observe our new friends, in line ahead of us, going across the street to get beer. \u00a0Damn they are smart! \u00a0Follow suit, ordering Pepper to purchase beers. \u00a0Pepper buys bottled beer. \u00a0We didn't have a bottle opener. \u00a0Bad Pepper! \u00a0return to store, use bottle opener. \u00a0Enjoy the juxtaposition of drinking beer out of paper bags while waiting to eat at fancy/schmancy Michelin-starred restaurant. \u00a0  4:50 PM: \u00a0Notice that a LONG line has formed behind us. \u00a0Drunkenly befriend everyone in line.   5:00 PM: \u00a0Notice that there are nervous, older, conservatively dressed people milling about near entrance to restaurant. \u00a0Suspect that they are trying to CUT IN LINE. \u00a0Share suspicions with entire line, thus creating angry mob. \u00a0Only to realize that the older nervous people are responsible individuals who made reservations, not the zany walk-in crowd in line. \u00a0Feel sheepish. \u00a0Drink more beer.  5:30 PM: \u00a0Game time! \u00a0Got a seat at Chef's Table, watched them prepare food.  HOLY CRAP THIS FOOD IS AMAZING!   Seriously, this food is really delicious, the concept is innovative, the service is very attentive and warm, and it was generally a fun experience. \u00a0I would choose to eat here rather than at Michael Mina or Gary Danko because it's different, relaxed, fun and I like the concept.  see you in line!  P.S. \u00a0Pepper and I were idiots and didn't get dessert (full from our 11 courses). \u00a0Bad move.",

    "review_text": "Solid 4.0 stars if not 4.25 stars.  I had heard about SBP from a friend and did my research on it too once my boyfriend and I had booked our trip to SF. Affordable Michelin rated food???? I had to make it a mission of mine to go while I was in SF! And having done just so, we had concluded that our asses had to be in line for this restaurant at least 45 mins before actual opening time - to be safe of course.   Fast forward to the trip...  When it came to the day we had actually scheduled time to go to SBP, public transportation was against us and we didn't get there until 5:35 (five minutes after opening) - damn that 38 bus route!!! The end of the line when we got there was four storefronts down from SBP's door!!!!! Every so often a lady would come out from the restaurant and inform us roughly what times we were looking at depending on where we were on line. On her third visit, she had estimated where the cut off was for that night's seating - four to six people behind us!!!   That chick was money man - spot on with the estimates!! By the time we got to the podium, the hostess said it would be close to 10:45pm ( 15 minutes before their closing time) for a table for 3: me, my boyfriend and a friend. So we took it, obviously.   Having been in similar scenarios before, we knew that the time they gave us was conservative, so we has decided to just grab drinks in the area just before. Then, at 9:55pm we get the text message from the hostess -- our table is ready early! BOOM!  Atlast, we were seated, and within minutes time, the cart of food is at our table! We had practically ordered everything on the cart and more from the written menu like was were drunk hungry - which we kind of were - AND had ordered a bottle of wine for the table too.  All in all we must have tried 10 - 13 dishes, including dessert. The everything was great, some more memorable than others. The sourdough pancakes, the pork belly, the braised short rib, the huge buratta on that fried garlic doughy goodness - were all amazing!!! The desserts - not so much.   Is it worth the wait? Yes. Did it live up to the hype? Yes. Would I come back? Definitely.",

    "review_text": "For the first of many upcoming birthday dinners, I chose the recent winner of the James Beard award for \"Best New Restaurant\". As it was a last minute decision, getting reservations was out of the question. After reading some Yelp suggestions, we showed up \u00a0at 4:25 p.m. and were the first in line for the walk-in lines. Half an hour later, there was a crowd of 25 behind us. It was a sunny but breezy cold afternoon in the city, and both of us commented how we had never done this before (wait in line for over an hour to eat in a restaurant). We were, however, able to watch some food preparation going on through the front window, and it looked like it would be worth the wait.   Doors opened promptly at 5:30 p.m., and people with reservations were taken first to their tables. Walk-ins get sat at the chef bar or small drink bar, there is even a place for four if they are willing to stand while they eat their meal; we opted for the drink bar. What followed in the next hour and a half was a dizzying whirlwind of small plates of delectable food brought by on a cart (dim-sum style) or offered to us by servers walking by. We had pork belly, oysters, mussels, curried scallops, octopus, rabbit croquettes, duck liver mousse, guinea hen dumplings, smoked salmon, and sashimi on a seaweed bruschetta. The only items we had off the menu were the state bird (quail), sea urchin pancakes, and dessert (chocolate torte).   The speed at which we were offered food was a bit overwhelming. After around 45 minutes, I started to feel the start of a early food coma. It wasn't the wine that brought it on, but just the large amount of rich food I consumed in a very short time. \u00a0I slowed down a bit and luckily felt better after a short time. Unfortunately, we didn't leave room in our stomachs for the Peking Duck, Garlic Bread with Homemade Burrata, Red Trout, Glazed Pork Ribs, or Lemon Curd Ice Cream Sandwiches. Regrettable, but I will definitely be back. And soon.  My advice to Yelpers: Pace yourself. JUST SAY NO (but rarely) or better yet \u00a0\"I'LL TRY THAT LATER\". The servers probably moonlight as car salespeople because they do a good version of the relentless (but very polite) hard sell. If they see you wavering, they might opt to make up your mind for you... \"OK, I'm just going to make this decision for you, you know you want it!\" All of the servers were GREAT, by the way, and obviously love this restaurant. It probably is so much fun to work in a place where people are enjoying themselves so much.   Will make a small mention of the bathroom (for you folks interested in this restaurant feature): There is only one unisex bathroom. However, it is nicely appointed with a fun painting of the USA with all the state birds listed on their corresponding states. The decor of the whole restaurant was interesting too, as some other reviewers have noted. But I was much too focused on the sensations my taste buds were having to really take much notice.  Our bill, after stuffing ourselves with a plethora of food and two glasses of wine each, was $175 (not including tip). Really a deal considering how much wonderful food we consumed and what a fabulous time we had. Well worth the wait!!!! Just do it. You won't regret it one bit.",

    "review_text": "Came here for their soft opening tonight and things were looking good! The concept here is dim sum style. They'll bring plates of small plates on a tray or cart and you can pick whichever one you want. They'll place the dish on your table and will put a hash mark on your bill according to the price. Their signature dish is the \"state bird with provisions\" as this dish is deep fried quail with lemon stewed onions. The pickled wild mushroom was one of my favorite. This dish is full of flavors and texture (hazelnut is the crunchy when you eat it with the mushrooms). The spiced shrimp is also full of flavors - definitely a must!  Their tea selection is very good also. I tried their \"dragon ball\" ice tea and their white chrysanthemum tea. Both were very light on flavor - which is my preference when it comes to tea.   Their dessert selection is very nice. The combination of ingredients and flavors are very unique and it works. My favorite was the chestnut buckwheat profiterole and the bittersweet chocolate croquettes. The peanut muscovado milk was better than expected, probably because I've never had peanut milk as dessert before!   The portions are small so you can definitely order 4-5 for 2 people. The price is also decent as they range from $5-$8 for the items we ordered tonight. You can definitely order all the items on the menu while you pop open a bottle of wine with a group of friends for the night. The staff is so friendly there that you will end up being there for hours! The open kitchen is located as you enter the door so you can see everything being made fresh right then and there.   Come give this place a try before everyone else finds out about it!!!",

    "review_text": "My party made a reservation two months in advance and was treated to a fixed menu of 18 dishes and an additional 4 bottles of wine.  I'd like to point out that the majority of my party was the SF foodie type and they all seemed to enjoy their food. My personal experience was a bit different though. I was quite disappointed in the meal as I felt all but a handful of dishes were mediocre. I feel like it's the perfect example of how creativity and simplicity don't necessarily equal great flavor or an outstanding dining experience.  The seating was also uncomfortable - we were squeezed into a corner but I'll give some credit since we were a large group.   Hog island oysters - awesome, can't go wrong here Ahi tartare- crisp, fresh, flavorful Duck liver mousse- I love liver so I was pretty excited for this, yet it surprised me by how sweet and non-liver tasting it was. In fact, the mousse was quite plain. Ricotta pancakes - good and hot  Horseradish and roe with potato chips - my least favorite thing all night. Weird textures all around - (slimy roe on potato chip?!) it didn't make any sense. All I could taste was salty chip.  garlic bread with beretta - difficult to cut and chew, bland. Heavy.  Palm salad - decent, balanced Pork belly - buttery fat but the meat was on the side of chewy and stringy. The sweet plums balanced it nicely. Quail eggs- salty, meh Quinoa cauliflower - meh, though I'm not a quinoa fan to begin with  CA state bird- even those who loved all the other dishes agreed this wasn't great. Overly breaded and flavorless.  Duck fried rice -a big hit with the table but I thought it was too salty and the crunchiness \u00a0of the rice bothered me, similar to eating popcorn kernels.  Lamb and squid- super salty  Red Trout - super salty Ice cream sandwich - good, wish the pastry was a bit softer. Liked the berry on top. Apple gateau- this had rosemary sprinkled on it. I wanted to like it but the creme fraiche and super herby flavor threw it off.  Overall, the service was excellent. Our meal took three hours to complete and it was nice to do a group tasting that was filling and creative enough to talk about. In the end, the food didn't quite deliver the bang that I was hoping for. It came out to be about $120 a person.",

I didn't love the quail (was kind of greasy and heavy) but most everything else was excellent. I went with my wife and another couple and the total was $200 plus tip but none of us had alcohol but we were all stuffed in a good way. We tried a ton of different things and even my rhubarb soda was really good. This is well worth trying once. I'm not in a huge rush to go back (not because it wasn't really good) but glad I tried it. I took off a star b/c we had a 9:00 pm reservation and waited 30 minutes for a table and they didn't offer us anything aside from a glass of water while we waited.

It was definitely trendy and innovative. \u00a0Who thinks of creating an American style Dim-sum/Tapas house?! \u00a0  You can either make a reservation or wait in line the day of. \u00a0They accept reservations for up to 60 days in advance and it generally fills up. But don't worry, you can still wait in line that day and have an opportunity to eat there. Apparently, you can have a member of your party come there early and pick a time and table for you to by later...kinda like auctioning off tables to the earliest person in line. \u00a0And actually, if you are patient enough, they try their best to seat everyone that waited. \u00a0We came by at around 8, put our name on the list and came back around 9:30. Even though last seating is 9:30, they still sat us at 9:45. \u00a0Yes, it's a late dinner but there was 5 of us, but we just HAD to go.   Hmmm...what did we get? Pretty much everything on the menu! I suggest going with more people because you can try more of the dishes. \u00a0Although, keep in mind that it's harder to get tables for larger groups and if you do end up reserving for a group of 6 or more, there's minimum table charge. Regardless, the servers came by table to table offering dishes that were not the menu...specials of the day...you can agree to it and they'll add a tally mark to your list or you can choose to pass it up. We ordered about 15 things for 5 people so it'd be hard to list everything we ate and review each dish but generally everything was good and well balanced. The dishes never overpowered one another so that each succeeding dish was equally good.   My Favorites: - Sweet Corn, garlic Chive Pancake - It was a total surprise but it was fluffy and savory - Red Trout - The fish pretty much melts in your mouth! - Roasted Bone Marrow - Soo fatty but in a good way - Pork Belly - One of the \"dim-sum\" specials that day...by far the best...so soft and perfectly well balanced with the other ingredients in the dish - Olive Oil Ice Cream Sandwich - Perfect ending to the meal!  Lastly, I really want to commend the staff. \u00a0They were very friendly and eager to serve you! \u00a0It's been a while since I've been to a place where the workers seem really happy being their. \u00a0It makes the atmosphere all the better.",

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions is one of the hottest restaurants in recent times. \u00a0Reservations for a 8pm spot took one month. \u00a0It's been reviewed by practically all the local critics and highly praised at that. \u00a0So naturally, my expectations were super high.  Although good, I don't think it quite measured up to what I was hoping for.  It's a Western-cuisine dim sum joint with many items brought by on carts or trays (the one big difference is that the servers are extremely well-versed on all the dishes and eager to impart this information, unlike the \"take-it-or-leave-it\" attitude at traditional dim sum restaurants). \u00a0A select number of items are also available on the menu and brought by only upon request. \u00a0A quick recap of dishes:  - Duck neck dumplings - quite good. \u00a0First dish of the night. Arguably one of the best.  - Homemade kimchi in a broth with a clam and tofu - rather bland with surprisingly little kimchi. \u00a0Disappointing.  - Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits - biscuits were a bit too sweet and the mousse didn't have that much flavor, although it offered a nice savory balance  - Oysters with pickled kohlrabi - didn't like this at all ... way too salty and the pickled taste was overpowering.  - Whipped trout mousse with peas and croutons - the server raved about this one ... but in all honestly, it was just alright. \u00a0The most interesting thing about this dish was the texture of the peas (or fava beans) - tasted more like edamame.  - Quinoa tuna tartare \u00a0- unique interpretation with crunchy uncooked quinoa on top of the softer cooked version that was mixed in with ahi tuna. \u00a0One of the better dishes of the night.  - World Peace peanut muscovado - served in a large shot glass, this was yummy (basically peanut milk)  - Macaron japonais with rhubarb - nice savory sweet combo but just ok to me.  I can see how some might rave about this place and others would be disappointed. \u00a0I think this time around, I was in the latter boat.",

    "review_text": "My palate is not sophisticated enough for fine dining and I don't often seek it or see the value in it.  State Bird Provisions gave me perspective in the form of impeccable service and incredible cuisine.  Even if you have to pay someone to stand in line before they open to put your name down, it's worth your dollar. (Yes, that really happened) Managed to get the chef's table right in front (apparently the best seat in the house) for dinner on a Wednesday evening at 8:30pm.  So, I didn't realize it was dimsum-style dining so that was a pleasant surprise right off the bat. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about each and every dish that was presented to us, never hesitating to make personal recommendations and answer my silly (but awesome) questions. Everyone working here has sharp senses and can smell your hesitation, curiosity, and probably even hear your thoughts from across the restaurant. (not in a creepy way but very perceptive)   Okay, on to the best part...the comida:  - Garlic Toast and Burrata Cheese: Holy hell. It is criminal to be this delicious. YOU MUST EAT THIS!! - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits: I'm not a fan of organs but this was surprisingly tasty. The duck liver was airy but still very savory and the almond biscuits were killer. - State Bird (quail): It's in their name; how can you fail at this? They did not disappoint. Magnificently fried, perfectly seasoned and succulent. - Fried pork belly: I think its worth trying but I thought it was too salty and a bit too chewy. - DO NOT leave without dessert. By some magical mistake, we were served two desserts: Blood orange-mint granita and their decadent chocolate ice cream sandwiches. Both very different but oh so good!  Everything else I tried was meh but I blame that on my unsophisticated palate.  It's totally worth your patience, time and cabbage.",

After hearing many ppl rave about how amazing this place was I jumped at the chance when my sister had an open reservation. It was a randoms Tuesday night at 8:30pm and of course it was still packed. I overheard that a walk-in had about a 45 min wait and the girl up from was super cute and pleasant. The restaurant was also really cutely decorated and so unassuming from the outside you'd never be able to tell this is THE restaurant in SF.  Everything we are was just amazing I think it's hard to even go wrong. The thing I like about the place that I learned there was it was mainly small plates, dim sum style where a cart literally comes around with small plates then on top of that there's a menu with staple items.   We were in love with this crunchy quinoa that came out on a cart seriously EPIC. Then we had this hamachi style tostada that I believe is a staple soooo good! The sort of cheese bread with buratta was out of this world! It was so delicious almost unheard of taste! We had a steak tartare equally amazing and some seafood dishes everything tasted extremely fresh and so original. You could easily taste every ingredient!   We split a bottle of wine as all between about 5 of us. For dessert, we had this coconut bao our waiter came by and said it was he last one - so nice of him! It was heaven paired with this cream and fruit compote wow!!! We also had the chocolate ganache on the menu and it was equally out of this world!  For 5 of us, we ended up spending about $50 per person not bad considering we kept ordering. That's the issue you can just keep going especially being small plates!  Overall OMG amazing! Must try in SF!",

    "review_text": "Today was my second visit to SBP, though the first time was well before reservations were hard to get and the line for walk ins wrapped around the corner by opening time. \u00a0The expansion definitely opened up greater capacity, and makes the space a lot more functional. \u00a0Arriving a little after 5 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday, there were about 15 people or so in line in front of us, and we got the last two bar seats before the cutoff. \u00a0Actually, sitting at the bar next to the kitchen was pretty cool, since you could see preparation and scope out prospective dishes for sampling. \u00a0I did wish they had hooks under the bar to hang my coat, since we were on bar stools.  We decided not to really order from the menu and just pick the offerings brought around, which were plenty, as we had ordered off the menu more during our first visit.  My Favorites of the Night: --Chocolate roll cake with caramel sauce and candied oranges: Chocolate cake was rich and ganache-like in a smooth caramel sauce. \u00a0Delicious. --Pork belly: Crispy, flavorful. --Chawanmushi: Beautifully hot, creamy, spicy. --Farro with wild mushrooms: Earthy mushrooms with creamy farro. \u00a0BF didn't care for this one as much, but I really love mushrooms.  Second Favorites, Still Delicious: --Pork Riblets: Tender, best slathered in its own juice/sauce. --Chips with Fish roe dip: Tasty warm dip. --Rabbit Croquette: A crunchy meaty bite. --Oyster: Lovely, but the spice probably overpowered the flavor of the oyster.  Nice, but Could Do Without: --Salmon Tartare: Didn't seem special, but was nice. Crunchy quinoa was the best part. --Garlic Bread Burata: Apparently popular, but not my favorite. \u00a0Bread too heavy/greasy --Hamachi Kama: Beautifully plump and glazed, but somehow felt too saucy/salty/strong without some rice to go with it. --Hamachi on seaweed raft: Nice, but hard to eat. \u00a0Had to use teamwork to break it apart without launching fish cubes off the plate. --Duck liver mousse with little biscuits: I usually love duck liver mousse, but the little biscuits are a little too small/heavy/greasy. \u00a0I would've traded them for some fresh bread.  Service was great, especially right by the kitchen where basically everyone is checking on you and asking if you need anything. \u00a0It's definitely a casual, fun environment, where the minute you sit down, people are ready to drop plates on your table for you to start eating. I would definitely love to come again if it ever cools down a bit, as I don't have the patience to try to book a reservation at 4 a.m. and don't want to stand in line for an hour before it opens.",

The food was as good as it was on the first visit and I must reiterate, there are a lot of hip restos in this city that are hard to get into but in truth, the food is really quite mediocre where as here at SBP, the food is very very good.

The tap pilsner was a great way to start our meal and the Barbera was bargain as we finished up.

Yeah, it's 'dim sum' like but without the crazy, pushy servers and customers. First impression was great. SBP was a clean looking (and smelling) place. The servers were friendly and attentive. I also liked the fact that the customers were giving off positive vibes and smiling. Whereas in a typical dim sum place, I always feel like cattle -- get herded in, grazes, get herded out -- and the customers are usually pushy and competitive.  We had some of the homemade chips and pancakes - yum! Also had a salad that was freshly made. We had a light meal (with ice tea) and it was very pleasant.

Finally, the big day came. Upon arrival at 5:30, there was already a loooong line going down the block, but they called all parties with reservations to the front.   So this is my new. favorite. restaurant. \u00a0We were a group of 4 and ordered 5 hot items off the menu, which was the quantity recommended by our server. We then ordered about 8-9 amazing \"dim sum\" items that were circulating the room. I love this decadent style of dining!   Everything was delicious - not a single disappointment - but there were a few standout items: cast iron quail eggs, sea urchin pancakes, smoked trout porridge, duck liver mousse with biscuits, pork belly (dear god!), hen dumpling in broth, and a heavenly cracker spread with sturgeon roe, lemon, and egg (I think?)...and the earl grey ice cream sandwich is a MUST. \u00a0   Atmosphere is totally casual, with pretty much every customer in jeans and servers in plaid shirts. Service is mercifully hipster-free....they were friendly and down-to-earth, no airs or pretentiousness. \u00a0The space itself is simple but stunning -- bricky lofty with very high ceilings and an open kitchen right where you walk in. The counter (for walk-ins) is set right up against the kitchen...I would imagine that sitting there and watching the artists in action is a special experience.  Now back to obsessively stalking their web site for another reservation.",

    "review_text": "3.5 stars  A caveat: Bon Appetit named State Bird Provisions best new restaurant of 2012 and the restaurant has received all sorts of awards and accolades since. I think I was probably there on an off day. I'm therefore clicking on four stars instead of three for my 3.5 star rating because, to be honest, I would probably trust Bon Appetit over my single visit.   State Bird Provisions' is built on a great concept. It's like non-exclusively Chinese dim sum. Dim Sum is amazing and taking the experience outside of the morning and opening it up to other culinary viewpoints (does that phrase sound like something from Top Chef, or what?) is brilliant. I will not call the dishes tapas, however, because I have found tapas restaurants to be way overpriced and State Bird Provisions is pretty reasonable.   So here's how it works:  1) You try to get a reservation and discover that the restaurant is totally booked for the next 60 days.  2) Wait in a long line. In our case, we arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday (the restaurant opens at 5:30) and were given an approximate time of 7:30 for a seating. 3) Have a drink and olives at Fat Angel nearby. 4) You'll get a menu from which you can order small plates. You can order from this menu if you want, but wait first to see what will come out of the open kitchen. A cart will be wheeled around with different small dishes for you to choose from. If you sit at the bar, as we did, the chefs and servers will offer you dishes the moment they are ready.   The experience is interesting and fun and, no doubt, the food is sophisticated and creative. This is probably the hardest gig for servers in town because they have to be salesmen as well as servers. I think it must take a really outgoing personality and I really give the servers there credit. My criticism, however, is that it just wasn't really seasoned the day we were there. I actually do not have much of a taste for salt at all. So if I felt that it needed a little, this lack was very noticeable. We almost ordered the cheesecake, which looked good when I saw other people order it, but the server convinced us to try this mochi thing which, to be honest, was not good. Afterwards, my friend and I realized nothing was really memorable. My friend said that the olives at Fat Angel were actually the best food we ate that night.   Overall, I think one of the cooks had an off day or an overly light hand with the salt the night we were there. I'd try it again--but only when the lines go down!",

    "review_text": "Was very much looking forward to trying this place out. \u00a0They received a lot of good press in the past year and if you combine that with their unique 'dim-sum' type of dining I was very intrigued.  The place has the atmosphere of a shoebox combined with a kindergarten classroom. \u00a0Cheap pressed boards with holes (like in a garage for hanging tools) cover the walls and ceilings, and the one wall that IS exposed is concrete. \u00a0I think this has something to do with trying to tamp down the acoustics that make this place almost unbearably loud. \u00a0I like loud. \u00a0I enjoy the energy and hum of a place that is packed on a Saturday night. \u00a0But keep my loud at something less than a lawnmower decibel level. \u00a0The lighting is without note. \u00a0I think it's flourescent covered by a bland fixture. \u00a0Not great lighting here. \u00a0The art here is almost non-existent. \u00a0Visually the place is very UN-stimulating.  The service was good, but not great. \u00a0Pet peeve....if you are going to address a table take the time to stop and do it properly; don't do it in a huff as you walk by without stopping or making eye contact. \u00a0It's an extra 2 seconds and makes a big difference. \u00a0Outside of the small things that make big differences we found the staff to be knowledgable, friendly and accomodating. \u00a0But not up to the standards of a restaurant getting national press. \u00a0Sorry, but you have to be ON YOUR GAME from a to z. \u00a0  The food was quite good. \u00a0But all small. \u00a0I think the small plate offerings hit a point of diminishing returns when you get too small. \u00a0And I think State Bird has gotten them too small. \u00a0Each plate is like a tea cup saucer. \u00a0Which really only allows one bite each for two. \u00a0This is just too little to be satisfying. \u00a0  And their namesake 'State Bird' is a quail that is so thickly breaded you can barely tell that there is supposed to be a slightly gamey wild bird underneath. \u00a0Tasted like chicken. \u00a0The saving grace is the onion/lemon/rosemary sauce underneath which could quite possibly be the best condiment I've ever had.  All else is good. \u00a0Some awkward combinations afoot: \u00a0Steak Tartare with hot peppers? \u00a0Not a good idea. \u00a0Pork Belly with Tofu? \u00a0C'mon. \u00a0  I'm now craving a decent serving of a simple meal.",

    "review_text": "Wanted to give this place 5, but the service has some kinks.  First, the atmosphere -- love the decor, two walls and a ceiling of pegboard. \u00a0It feels surprisingly warm and welcoming, and for a small space, not at all cramped.  Our dedicated waitress was absolutely lovely (I think her name was Sarah?) and on the ball, as was the gentleman at the front expediting, who still made time to chat with us.   The kinks come in the dim sum service. \u00a0We were seated right at the front of the restaurant, but were often totally ignored by the cart and the passing trays, even when our table was totally devoid of other dishes. \u00a0Meanwhile, food would be offered to tables where several plates were already being enjoyed. \u00a0It kind of felt like we were in a service blind spot. \u00a0I recommend asking for a seat near the back, they seemed to get more attention.  Ok, on to the food:  Of the commendables we had  1) the uni pancake  \u00a0 \u00a0 --very generous serving of uni, the soy lime sauce was a great pairing, and the garnish of pea shoots and bean sprouts was a great textural contrast. \u00a0We were fans  2) the short stack of guanciale pancakes  \u00a0 \u00a0--not super bacony, well balanced, love the maple flavor of the candy cap mushroom powder. \u00a0Total breakfast for dinner and very satisfying.  3) the glazed pork ribs  \u00a0 --good, but boring. \u00a0They're pork ribs. \u00a0Tender, meaty, nice sweetish glaze. \u00a0The cooked bitter greens with it were lovely.   Of the circulating items we had  1) the duck mousse with little corn cakes  \u00a0--super creamy mousse, not aggressively flavored but definitely duck liver. \u00a0The corn cakes were moist and sweet. \u00a0Would get this again in a second.  2) the smoked trout mousse with croutons, fava, and mint  \u00a0--the mousse itself was a bit salty, but paired with the unsalted croutons and fava, it worked, since both offset the salt well, but it wasn't amazing.  3) the smoked duck breast  \u00a0--gorgeously tender duck breast, perfectly seasoned, with delicious little bits of potato. \u00a0Also a winner  4) the guinea hen ravioli with broth.  \u00a0--the ravioli itself was piping hot with a well seasoned filling that tasted like it had a healthy dose of five-spice. \u00a0Sadly, the broth was tepid at best, which detracted from the ravioli. \u00a0Maybe they should drop the broth? It felt unnecessary.  5) the pork fried (rice? farro?) with pickles, greens, and a poached egg  --tasty, but felt like it was lacking salt. \u00a0The pickles were a nice touch though --the contrasted with the texture of the egg and the flavor of the rice/farro well. Definitely did not blow we away.   6) the fried green garlic dough with burrata  \u00a0--Um, it's piping hot fried dough with yummy yummy cheese. \u00a0Get this.   Dessert:  1) Macaron Japonaise -- almond and rhubarb. \u00a0Sour. \u00a0Not my favorite.  2) Ice cream sandwich -- you may be turned off by the portion size but don't be deceived. \u00a0These are delicious but SUPER rich. \u00a0That portion is more than enough.  I know this sounds like a lot of food but some of the portions were fairly small, which I loved because we got to try so much! \u00a0Two people, 4 glasses of wine, and all of this for $145 (after tip). \u00a0Definitely worth a trip back.",

    "review_text": "Note: There is no sign on the door, so keep a lookout for the address and/or a fancy silver door next to a window where you can see chefs cooking.  After waiting forever to get a reservation at State Bird Provisions, I was finally able to dine here (then promptly sat on writing my review for half a year). The food at State Bird is definitely unique, and I loved a lot of their complex combinations of flavors and textures. However, there were also a few dishes that I didn't enjoy.   Reservations are highly recommended, unless you don't mind coming early (before they open) to wait in line for the tables reserved for walk-in guests. If you have a reservation, you get to bypass the line and walk straight through the doors to check in with the hostess, who then seats you promptly. They have a menu of dishes you can order, and also servers who push a cart or walk around with trays of other dishes that change daily. We tried:  -Raw Oyster (w/Pickled Kohlrabi, Togarashi Oil, $3/ea, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): This was good, but not amazing. The oysters were fresh, but I didn't love this and probably wouldn't order it again. -Duck Liver Mousse w/Almond Biscuits ($6, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#Ny87aOzcDQUPzXpejaDFnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): I loved the chewy almond biscuits more than the duck liver mousse, and would order this dish again just for the biscuits. Highly recommended! -Guinea Hen Dumpling (w/Aromatic Broth, $3, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#sVjsZtCiUoUxq0mlu6TtXw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Just ok- the dumpling skin was thin, and the broth was flavorful, but not amazing. -Garlic Bread w/Burrata ($8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#Dgko-kYs3xZFL-o0G-5dkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Yum! The burrata was delicious, and I liked the texture of the garlic bread. -Hamachi w/Avocado Sauce on Nori Cracker ($9, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#kD7iXu21s2MaLPNuRyKuog\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Ok- I loved the freshness of the hamachi pieces, but it was awkward trying to balance the pieces of fish on this large cracker. -Mushroom Risotto (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#7OCGrrfp0FlQAlaRqEIYYw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Ok, but really heavy. This dish had good flavor, but really fills you up. -Crispy Pork Belly, Grapes, Jalapenos, Vietnamese Herb Vinaigrette (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#PJLf_-usezYYJ0Uciuly2g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Yum! The pork belly was really tender, and I liked the flavors of this dish. -Glazed Pork Spare Ribs ($20, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#j--avFdFjG8LIq8zY4mSsA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Just ok- I had higher expectations for the ribs. The sauce was sticky and on the sweet side, and the ribs were tender, but I probably wouldn't get them again. -CA State Bird w/Provisions ($16, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#fAsdsPtoZK7q1eyYVlOXhg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): A must order- this is the most amazing dish on their menu, and I would definitely come back to have this again! The quail is perfectly crispy and super flavorful. -Lobster Salad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#0uqqL5kv-OrHuB5EqHGf_g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Yuck, this was my least favorite dish, and I didn't like it at all. Skip! -Sourdough, Sauerkraut, Pecorino, Ricotta Pancake ($8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#VdyiwjVQ2g_qBMXDxW7T5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Pretty good, and you get a huge portion for the price. I thought this dish was interesting, and would recommend trying it, but it really fills you up. -Buckwheat Bao, Coconut Cream, Carrot Jam, Maple Pecans ($8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#OO9adtqFlQMrQETnoT0Wvg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Eh, disappointing. The bao looked really pretty, but it was hollow inside and very bland. Also, I didn't like the coconut cream/carrot jam combo- skip! -Eggnog Ice Cream Sandwich, Almond Macaron, Cocoa-Sherry Coulis ($8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#ooGOA8m2hB70KVgT37bwrg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): AMAZING. I wish they sold this ice cream sandwich in stores, because it was so delicious, and this is coming from someone who isn't an egg nog fan. This is a must order if/when it comes back on the menu! -Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache Tart, Brown Sugar-Oat Crust, Olive Oil ($8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco?select=I4J8H4uDWmXLjzQ24V3SuA#cXWgEcT7QR98tSYyiZMt4w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>): Just ok, but I don't think any dessert could live up to the eggnog ice cream sandwich.",

    "review_text": "Gotta give these guys 5 stars.   The basics: \u00a0Service is great - ask questions, joke around, learn something. They even gave us the Duck Liver Mousse/Almond Biscuit while we were waiting for our table. Everyone that works there is knowledgeable, interactive and really look like they enjoy what they're doing. \u00a0Prices aren't bad (especially what you get, and especially for the City). Atmosphere great - not stuck-up, not divey, but Fun, somewhat loud and exciting.  I'm not a food pro, but I do eat a lot - I have to say everything we had was amazing. \u00a0 The kind of amazing where you don't want to use your napkin because there are still good flavors left to be had after you put that delicious quail leg down.(Get the State Bird w Provisions, 1/2 order for 2 people, Full for 4). \u00a0 The kind of delicious where when you get the garlic bread and burrata and the burrata ends up all over your face and you still can't use that napkin.   A few other favorites in no particular order:  -Guinea Hen Dumpling with Broth. \u00a0Get one for each person. Drink the broth when your dumpling is done. -Clam &amp; sungold tomato salad. Wish there was a little more sauce, but clams were perfection. -Duck Liver Mousse/Almond Biscuit - Fo' Free. Delicous small bites. -charred octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa - great texture, 'salsa' is great - salty and spicy. Crunchy octopus parts are the best! -tombo tuna-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker \u00a0- this could have been my favorite, though it is nearly impossible to choose. Get this. -smoked wild king salmon with pea hummus &amp; meyer lemon - very good, especially if you liked smoked fish of any kind.  -sourdough, sauerkraut pancakes. Comes with this saurkraut salt. I was eating just the leftover salt with my fingers when the cakes were gone...  -lemon curd 'ice cream' sandwich, poppy seed macaron, blueberries, fennel. Wow. So an ice cream sandwich - but instead of the normally delicious fake chocolate 'bun', they make it out of a flippin' delicious poppy macaron. Couldn't get enough of this.  In short, go here. Enjoy, Have Fun and eat til you can't.",

    "review_text": "I made it to State Bird Provisions....FINALLY! \u00a0With all the \"hype\" about this place, I went in with very low expectations.  Reservations are suggested and need to be made months in advance. \u00a0It took me a while to get reservations here as I was trying during the day. \u00a0Turns out you need to make reservations at 4:00 a.m. in order to score a spot! \u00a0  As I was standing in line waiting for the doors to open, I felt like a kid standing in line at Disneyland anxious to get on a ride. \u00a0But in this case, I was anxious and excited to get in and finally dine at this establishment. \u00a0The second you walk through the door, you are immediately \u00a0greeted by the friendly staff members. \u00a0The selling point is the \"dim sum\" concept, but in this case, it's not Chinese food that's being carted or carried around. \u00a0The vibe was fun.  We ordered:   Pork spare ribs glazed in it's own juices ($12) - Amazing! \u00a0For the price, you get, four generously portioned pieces and very tasty. Pork fell off the bones and would have probably gotten another if we didn't have so much to try already . The pork was very tender and perfectly seasoned. \u00a0This was our favorite dish of the night! (***)  Duck and fontina cheese croquette ($4) \u00a0- 2 pieces per order and was pretty tasty.  Guinea hen w/ cumin dumpling - 1 piece per order and \"A\" enjoyed this. The lemon flavor was refreshing and made it different from what he's used to. I, however, wasn't a fan as the cumin was overwhelming.  Salmon tartare - \"A\" thought this dish was just OK. \u00a0Although nothing unique, I found it quite refreshing with the cucumbers. \u00a0(**)  Hamachi crudo on seaweed cracker- This came on a big piece of seaweed with hamachi pieces on top. One of our favorites as it was tasty as well. (***)  Roti of curry rabbit, lentils, &amp; mushrooms \u00a0- I couldn't taste the curry, but the rabbit was tender and not dry. \u00a0Large portion and was ok, wish it had more flavor (*)  Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms and pink peppercorn - \"A's\" usually not a fan of bone marrow so I have no idea why he decided to try this lol. He was pretty full by the time it arrived, \u00a0but it wasn't bad.  Fried pork belly - One of \"A's\" other favorites. \u00a0I thought it was a bit too fatty, but it was tasty. \u00a0It reminded me of the salt and pepper pork chops you get at Chinese restaurants. \u00a0(**)  Garlic bread with burrata cheese- Our least favorite dish. \u00a0We didn't taste any garlic and assumed it would be crunchy but it was like eating a donut with a glop of cheese on top. (*)  Oyster - I thought this was just OK (*)  CA state bird with provisions ($9 half order) - Fried buttermilk battered quail with a saut\u00e9ed onion sauce. Although this is their specialty, I thought it was just okay.  SBP Hibiscus Ginger Lime Soda - It was okay..kind of had a medicinal taste.  Chocolate \"ice cream\" sandwich, smoked meringue, spicy cocoa nib, apricot ($8) - delicious. \u00a0I liked the chewiness of the brownie. \u00a0  ***Must try **Really good *Meh  Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience. \u00a0Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss, but that's expected. \u00a0I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of the dishes I didn't get to try.",

It was well worth the long wait and it was a bit pricey but the food was super delicious.. We tried almost every thing that passed through our table. I like about this restro was the portion was just right, the food tastes just right and did not make you having a heavy full feeling. I suggested that you go with a big group so the wait won't be long and you will get to try almost every food that they bring out and pass by your table. \u00a0I love their desserts...

    "review_text": "5 Stars for the food 3 star for the Flow and Service. (please note this is not the servers themselves, who are wonderful, but the overall service experience)  I am not an avid reviewer, but I have been here twice, each time with a similar experience so I thought it should be noted. First and foremost the food is simply fabulous, and you MUST save room for dessert! Faves...they do the most amazing things with quinoa \u00a0(who knew?!), the State Bird, tuna crudo, nd the Chocolate Birdseed dessert. The food is innovative, simple yet unique flavor profiles, not stuffy, and there is a wide variety of dishes to fit any palate.   Now for the concept and service. Once you get seated, you will be greeted by a wonderfully friendly server, who will explain how things work. Then they leave and you can just start picking up plates as they are passed around. Issue...After that initial interaction it is really hard to get their attention. No one comes back to take your drink order! You literally have to flag someone down (after 10 minutes) to order a glass of wine. Meanwhile you see two servers setting a 4-top, while you are still parched and wanting that lovely glass of wine.   Next...the passed plates. I wish there was a list (either verbal or written) of the evenings \"tapas\". The flow of the passed dishes is not always consistent, and unfortunately if you are seated not at the front tables, the trays are empty before they get to you. There were several dishes that we missed due to this. We also missed out on the duck liver mousse, bec we didnt see that until we were half way through dessert. We finally asked a server what else they were passing around so we'd have an idea. If we knew what was coming, we could have paced our meal better. You kind of get a feeling of being left to fend for yourself, and it's up to you to ask what is coming next or flag someone down if you want something.   State Bird...I love ya, but the service flow issues need to be worked out. Maybe with the new reno??? I also hear the counter is THE place to be. Wish we could have sat there with our reservation.",

Must haves and highlights: -Duck liver mouse  -STATE BIRD WITH PROVISIONS - the best damn quail I've ever had -Fry bread with burrata cheese and fresh cracked pepper  Everything else was just meh...however the clams with pork belly and kimchi really tasted like home cooked asian food.

Not an \"I ate so much food and feel so full\" kind of stomachache, but like a \"whoa that fried quail/dessert did not sit well\" stomachache. So, as much as I've enjoyed (some of) the food, it's hard to deliver a solid verdict when it's made me feel like crap afterwards.  I think this place is more about the experience than the food. It's a fun environment and the dim sum thing is unusual and interesting. I've had a few dishes that I thought were really remarkable (beef salad, vegetables with romesco, a dungeness crab dish back in January), and a bunch I thought were not very special (any/all of the pancakes, the burrata garlic knot). I also think some of the crudo dishes sit too long on trays waiting for a taker. We had some sliced grilled rabbit on pea puree that seemed unintentionally cold (one of the passed dishes). It still tasted great, but I wondered if it was at the right temperature. The desserts have really not agreed with me, especially the ice cream sandwiches. I would definitely avoid those.  For a place with this much hype, the prices are pretty reasonable. It's easy to get plenty of food, a few drinks, and dessert for $50-$60 per person after tip. Most beers are like $5, which is really fair of them. Service is also great. The people are good at what they do - they're all over the place covering for each other. So, I guess I'd recommend trying it out, but after three visits I've definitely had my fill.",

This was just a few days after the Bon Appetit coverage, so I was very surprised that the wait turned out to be only 30 minutes.  The chef's counter is where it's at. This restaurant being what it is, the chefs, who double as order takers, are all hip and pretty, and are happy to answer questions about the dishes you're eyeing. They were a little pushy with the special, but did it in a way that I felt bad for them that I didn't want to try the gigantic sardine.  Had the green garlic bread with burrata, which will make all other garlic breads disappoint me for the rest of my life. The eponymous bird was awesome but small; next time, I'll get the whole order instead of the half.  You go here for the food and the experience.

    "review_text": "The question looms: \"Where can I possibly eat after this ethereal experience?\"  I woke up dreaming of all the intricate, well-balanced, shining flavors I experienced last night over what felt like an extremely decadent dinner.   First off, the service was exemplary. We were mainly in the capable hands of Sarah, and she was friendly, professional, intuitive... (She even asked at the beginning if we had any food allergies. ) Sarah paced our dishes in a way that placed the strongest, heartiest fare toward the end so we could really taste the subtleties of the earlier dishes. The timing at which the dishes arrived was perfect too! \u00a0(Again, intuitive.)  We started with provisions delivered by cart. Before being seated, we were very curious (and skeptical) about the concept. When the cart first arrived, we got it!! \u00a0To be able to see the colors, the presentation, experience the aromas at the time of ordering was a total treat. We started with: oysters, trout tartar with quinoa, green onion flatbread with cheese, duck neck dumplings in sauerjus...  The oysters were perfect: the flavors delicate and balanced, with a bit of daikon and reminiscent of Japanese flavorings. The trout tartar with quinoa had delicate, layered flavors and the most amazing texture... Green onion flatbread with cheese: Had such a nice undercurrent of a citrusy flavor (like lemongrass??) That just kicked it to the next level. The duck neck dumplings were probably the star of round 1. Not to be missed!!  Next, we really couldn't decide what to order off the menu as it all sounded amazing. Soooo, we ordered almost everything: chicories, sourdough-sauerkraut-pecorino-ricotta pancakes, state bird (quail), trout with garum butter, glazed pork ribs, ricotta cavatelli dumplings, beef cheeks with radishes and bone marrow...  It sounds like a lot of food, right? It was! My dining companion is a sous chef so we decided to go in for the full experience. :-) It was totally worth it!  chicories: tangy, bursting, balanced with the almonds, dates, yogurt...  The panckaes: I was actually not too psyched about the pancakes. When they arrived, however, they blew my mind! \u00a0We ate them \"Mmmmming\" and \"Mmmmming\" when my dining companion realized it was evoking a childhood comfort for him: perogies!!! He was right.   State bird (quail) - the breading was perfect, the tangy onions served as the bed for the quail were divine!  Ok. You get the point.  The star dish for me: the ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms &amp; spinach. \u00a0Wow! Wow! Wow! \u00a0the mushroom flavor stood strong as did the flavor of the perfectly-textured cavatelli. My favorite.   Desserts: milk chocolate sesame crunch with clementine cocoa jam beer begnets rhubarb crisp with rosa gardenia ice cream  The desserts were as innovative as they sound. The begnets and the sesame crunch took the prizes from our table.  All of this plus beer, wine, a pomegranate spritzer ... still reasonably priced for a nice dinner out for 2. \u00a0It also made for a great date: discussions of the food, sharing the experience, discovering the nuances: great date spot!  Make a reservation. They are busy!",

Quick tip: apparently you have to line up before open and they book their seats first come first reserved style but if you come around 10pm (I know, late) then you may get seated as walk in, maybe. Good luck.",

    "review_text": "So this is what tapas mean, very small plates. \u00a0No need to try the wonton, please skip, not worth $3.00 for one wonton. \u00a0Use that money to get dessert. \u00a0This dining experience requires your taste buds. \u00a0Beef tongue tasted like pastrami. \u00a0Garlic bread with burrata (mozzarella and cream), a little heavy. \u00a0It reminds me of a bread puff. \u00a0Didn't taste any garlic. \u00a0Pork Belly (Crunchy on the outside and cooked perfectly) was my friend's favorite. \u00a0They had bone marrow and it was a good size bone marrow. \u00a0 \u00a0My favorite was the asparagus with whatever cream sauce (tasted like reduced blue cheese?) and shavings of cheese. \u00a0We had the root veggie tapas. \u00a0There were quite a few dishes with figs, but I've forgotten which dish came with them. \u00a0The thing with these food is that you should have the menu in front as a cheat sheet of what you are eating. \u00a0We loved our waiter, Ben, who was patient to explain every little dish that came by our table. \u00a0My friend wanted to acknowledge Ben. \u00a0I have to say the wait staff really makes the dining experience fun. \u00a0In this case, I felt like we were in a test kitchen being the taste testers. \u00a0We should hand in our evaluations and raise our number paddle like Dancing with the Stars! \u00a010! \u00a0The Blue Bottle Coffee ice cream sandwich with macarons cookies was a 10! \u00a0The lamb dish was a bit salty. \u00a0The blueberry/strawberry meringue tart was my friend's favorite dessert. \u00a0 Having dinner at 9 pm was not our first choice and leaving full and satisfied at 10:30 p.m. made me more alert. \u00a0I had to wake up at 4 am to make this reservation 2 months ago. \u00a0Was it worth it? \u00a0YES. \u00a0Once we got there, we didn't have to wait long to be seated. \u00a0The place had no door signs, so look for the portholes. \u00a0They had remodeled and I am so glad that they opened up their dining area with bench chairs. \u00a0Their last seating is at 10:00 p.m. and definitely, there were plenty of seats for those who want to come late. \u00a0The bill came and we didn't feel \"robbed.\" \u00a0I felt like we got our money's worth and I didn't have to stand in line or drive 2 hours to Napa. \u00a0The atmostphere was very relaxing and we can actually hear each other talk. \u00a0The chef bid us good night as we walked to exit, so all is well.",

They were super attentive too. We had the duck liver mousse with almond biscuit. you had me at duck liver. The garlic bread with burrata is ridiculous and a MUST.

Once they do, they'll instruct groups with reservations to make a line on one side, and any walk-in's on the other. They've got this part down efficiently and waste no time seating tables.  It's a dim sum style service serving american food. It feels like you're back in workshop class with perforated beige walls and woodshop art projects on display. It feels new and fresh despite spending many weekends dining at a traditional dim sum restaurant in San Francisco. My table had a lot of fun choosing dish after dish from each passing cart (while trying to ignore the equally noticeable price tags). We supported the small plates with two dishes off their printed menu to round it off and ordered a bottle of wine. It was the perfect amount and we felt well taken care of by the staff.  The stand outs from the night and current menu:  Garlic Bread with Burrata (FAVORITE! Get it. Doesn't disappoint.) Dungeness Crab and Mandarin Gelatina w/Avocado Hamachi Avocado Seaweed Crostini Pork Ribs with Swiss Chard (A heartier dish) Chicory Ice Cream Sandwich with Coconut Caramel  And finally, the State Bird with Provisions. Our friend deemed the breading the ultimate Shake N Bake and assured us he would buy it in bulk if it existed. I've had quail at many Chinese restaurants and enjoyed eating it cooked a different way at State Bird. The onions are tangy and delicious.",

And while I do agree the food was really good, I wasn't completely blown away.   A big part of it for me was the fact that they come up to you every 5 minutes asking to try something off the tray. This would be fine -- IF you had the option to opt out. I've eaten at similar restaurants (Dim-Sum and Brazilian churrascaria steakhouses) where you can put up a small flag or other such indicator on they table if you would not like to be approached by the food trays. It became hard to have a conversation with my date when we were being interrupted every few minutes and I found myself starting to resent the servers for doing so, even though the staff was actually really nice.  My only other critique would be lighting. The decor is neat but it was too bright in there, which hurt the ambiance. Felt like a cafeteria.   I would recommend it for sure, and all this to say the food *was* really good -- especially interesting and tasty was the fish egg/egg salad and the ribs. And of course the state bird...with provisions. :)",

I'll be back for sure but I am not one to get up at 4am just to get a table. They do take walk-ins, both for the bar &amp; a few tables.

    "review_text": "State Bird with provisional 60 day wait to get a reserved table! Yay, still a fan but minus one star for that 60 day wait.  The day and time came alas for our reservation which took 60 days to arrive. Cut short that last 30 minutes that Tarantino flick, Django Unchained, just to make our 10:30 Saturday night reservation. That was brutal so I was hoping State Bird Provisions would make our first visit worth the visit and make us forget what had ever happened to Django.  The +'s: +Saturday night parking was not a wretch. We landed a place three blocks north of the destination but this area can get sketch. Luckily a policeman caught a brawl on the street and we safely passed. +Staff are very friendly and nice. Such a nice reception! +Quail eggs. Half a dozen arrived sunny side up. They were delish. Just perfect golden jewels! +Sea urchin pancake at $14. Get it before it runs out. It was just that good! +Glazed pork ribs on Swiss chard. The meat slid right off that rib. Half order is enough I think for 2 girls. Consider the Full order (4 ribs) if you have a bigger appetite. +Chocolate mochi dessert was plenty for two. That date with marscapone on the side definitely was a winning combination. + Plenty of tapas kept running by our table on a timely basis. I love the idea of tapas rolling by dim sum style. There was plenty of variations to keep us hungry for more inventive creations but sated after each taste.  The -'s - BIG minus is this 60 day wait for a reservation. Mentioning it a third time because it's a real sore point but hey this place is still hype. At least you can show up and hope you get seated before the places closes. - Not all the tapa dishes are a hit and at $8-11 per tapa, the bill tab adds up way faster than a dim sum restaurant. - It's kinda noisy. Voices echoed off our silverware, table, glasses and walls. It was kinda hard to hear my companion speculate on what had happened to Django in the end. - Mushroom dumpling. Meh. I thought it was salty and not much but my companion disagrees completely and said it was a highlight of the meal. - There was a poke like mix of tuna and chick peas that top off a potato chip. Not my fave either.",

Very interesting I must say. \u00a0You don't hear loud Asians screaming \"HAR GOW!! HAR GOW!!\" while pushing their carts, but rather polite Americans going to each table describing each dish that is too complex for you to even handle. \u00a0  All dishes were different, delicious, and unique. \u00a0We had 10 dishes for 2 people, small plates that average to $8 a dish. \u00a0Funny how the most expensive dish ($12 dungeneous crab and farro spezzato) was the least favorite. \u00a0It was just too much butter.   The best was of course, the \"CA State Bird with Provisions\" on the menu. \u00a0Breaded and fried quail, although it tasted like tasty gourmet fried chicken! Juicy, not greasy, tender, and the lemon juice made this dish perfect.  My other favorite was the \"Smoked Trout, Egg, and Potato Porridge.\" \u00a0Omg that blew me away! SO tasty. This is why I love fine dining - one scoop is just bursting with many different flavors that combine to make one amazing experience in your mouth. \u00a0Gosh, I want this dish again. \u00a0  SUMMARY (of my opinions of course): 1. CA State Bird with Provisions - 5 (menu) 2. Smoked Trout, Egg, and Potato Porridge - 5 3. Hamachi Avocado and Seaweed Cracker - 5 4. Steak Tartare with Porcini Ranch - 4 5. Charred Octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa - 4 6. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - 4 7. Raw Oyster with Spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame - 4  8. Pork Spare Ribs glazed in their own juices - 3 (menu)  9. Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - 2 (i don't like curry :( ) 10. Dungeness crab and farro spezzato - 1 (too much butter)   OVERALL: Other than the 2 dishes I disliked, 8/10 of them were all delicious, some even amazing where you have never had a dish like before (trout egg potato porride). 5 stars for the great service, quality of food, and unique concept of the restaurant that I am proud to say is from my home of San Francisco.",

In my opinion, it represents all the best qualities of what San Francisco dining should be and is an example of why SF is such a great food city. The space is sparse and unpretentious. The service attentive but casual. And the food was thrilling and inventive.   Sure, not every dish was perfect - but when you are out there on the edge trying new things, I don't expect bull's eyes every time. I would say 70% of the dishes were outstanding, 20% very good, and 10% were so-so.   There are definitely some must tries if they have them on the night you are there: the garlic burrata bread (transcendent), the seafood \"salsa\" (chock full of perfectly cooked mussels and scallops), the ricotta sauerkraut pancakes (sauerkraut salt!), and the zucchini with smoked eggplant and fermented garlic (an incredible, unexpected combo of flavors). We also really enjoyed the pickled, fried cauliflower in the cheddar-beer sauce. We will skip the duck pate and almond biscuits next time (the flavors just didn't jibe for us) as well as the smoked trout spread with favas (ho hum flavors). The granita with tapioca and figs for dessert was excellent. I won't be recommending this spot to my vegetarian friends - it would be pretty tortuous to let all those interesting meaty dishes go by, but as for me - we are booking our return trip for next month tonight!",

    "review_text": "Let me preface this by saying that I love my Bon Appetit magazine...I've cooked tons of recipes from their magazine and I love reading their various articles an tips! \u00a0I am a loyal reader and I really trust them. \u00a0So maybe my expectations were set too high since I had read about this place on Bon Appetit as being the Best New Restaurant in America. \u00a0I just can't seem to agree less.  First off, we had a 9:30 reservation and did not get seated until a little after 10pm. \u00a0There is really no room to stand around and wait in there since they have to cart their food through any open space they have so we kept getting asked to move out of the way with no acknowledgment or apologies that they were late on our reservation. Fine, sometimes they can't control the tables eating beforehand but I would have expected them to feel bad about seating us so late and perhaps offer us a glass of wine or something. \u00a0I will say though at the very end of the meal someone did come to our table and thank us for waiting for so long to eat and that they were sorry about the wait. \u00a0I would have felt better had they done that from the start.  Part of why they probably won Best New Restaurant in America is due to their unique style of service. \u00a0Think Dim Sum...but is that really new or unique? \u00a0I've been eating in dim sum restaurants since I was a toddler....I won't say how old I am but let's just say it's not new...not by a long shot. \u00a0   The servers and hosts were not particularly friendly either. \u00a0I will say there was one server there that was actually really nice and then rest never really smiled and didn't have really have any personalities. Maybe they are just too hip for me.  There were four of us so we pretty much almost ordered everything they had that night on the menu. \u00a0Of course you may never have these items on your menu if you go but I will review based on our menu that night. I wouldn't say the food was bad but I wouldn't say anything really blew my mind and made me want to go back anytime soon. \u00a0There were also a couple things that had strange flavor combinations that just did not work or that just didn't taste right. \u00a0A couple of those dishes came to mind that I wish I hadn't ordered:  1. Kimchi-pork belly with tofu. \u00a0Something was off putting with their tofu. \u00a0The taste reminded me of the smell of bad tofu...and since I have never eaten bad tofu but boy have I smelled it, I could only imagine their tofu is how bad tofu would taste...sour and bitter and made me want to spit it out.  2. Glazed Pork Ribs with Swiss chard, Togarashi. \u00a0I could not finish my pork rib. \u00a0Not because I didn't try but it was so dry that I could not get it off the bone. \u00a0Even when I tired to fork and knife it it was tough.  3. Pickles, Smoked Albacore-Lardo Butter. The main parts of this dish were not bad tasting but they had these chicharron toppers and when I bit into mine it was like a piece of rubber. \u00a0Not crispy, rubbery as hell. \u00a0Not edible...imagine biting into a piece of styrofoam, I couldn't even bite it in half. Not to also mention that they were completely tasteless. \u00a0I should give them 2 start just because they didn't put any salt on those fried pork rinds. \u00a0Isn't seasoning your food \"cooking 101\"?  4. Marble Chocolate Pudding, Birdseed Crunch, Passionfruit. \u00a0This dish was not finished by any of us and that's hard to imagine. We finished every other dish except this one and the 3 above. \u00a0The pudding and the passionfruit just didn't taste good together.  However, I will say though that there were a few dishes that helped them retain my 3 star rating:  1. Garlic Bread and Burrata. \u00a0Think deep fried beignet with creamy burrata...I mean you can't really mess that up. \u00a0Fried bread nom nom nom...it was good. \u00a0  2. Cheesecake Japonaise, Tomato Carmel, Strawberries. \u00a0This was excellent. \u00a0Light and creamy just like the Japanese cheesecakes you get at the Japanese market except even better since it's fresh.  3. Chanterelle Egg, Pecorino &amp; Pork Jowl. \u00a0This was a good dish, the flavor combinations of the creamy, salty, fatty were just perfect. \u00a0The egg was custardy and delicious.  4. Sweet Corn &amp; Garlic Chive \"Shortstack\" with Mt. Tam. \u00a0Probably cause I love Mt. Tam cheese from cowgirl creamery but these little pancakes were delightful! \u00a0And, I just love corn right now...any fresh corn dish will win me over.  Don't get me wrong, I am proud as hell a new restaurant in my hometown achieved Best New Restaurant in America on Bon Appetit magazine, but did it really earn it? \u00a0Hard to say unless I go and try all the other 9 restaurants on their list. \u00a0In my opinion though, nothing there really blew my mind and I'm not really itching to go back anytime soon.   Hopefully you will have a better experience and menu when you go try it!",

Michelin and James Beard and Yelp-approved, there was a LOT of anticipation going into this dinner.  We did a double date for maximum dish-tasting capacity. We ordered a few things from the menu and just snagged cart dishes that looked good as they went by. The menu items -- sauerkraut pancake, sea urchin pancake, were super good. They're not really pancakes but I guess how else would you describe them? Savory dough vessels for delicious toppings. The state bird was like an interesting fried chicken. Bone marrow and cumin lamb dishes were super rich and satisfying but not altogether very unique in flavor.  I think we also had the cauliflower salad but it was pretty forgettable.. we def had a forgettable cauliflower something, maybe from the cart. The guinea hen dumplings were whatever too, from the cart. Pork riblets were pretty good. The garlic bread with burrata, amazing. Oysters were nice.  For dessert we had the coffee toffee ice cream and buckwheat coconut bao.. not a huge fan of either tbh, thought they were just okay. I wouldn't have ordered any of the desserts except we didn't think we'd come back to try it another time.  I really wanted to like this place more! Considering the hype.. and the wait.. and the like $300 bill. There are better spots int he city.",

They work very hard to get food out quickly and let as many people enjoy their art. This place is a foodies dream. Everything we tasted we truly loved. I recommend asking the wait staff for their recommendations and being adventurous. You won't regret it!  P.S. probably not the best place to take picky eaters.

    "review_text": "Ohh. Em. Gee.  I just had the most thrilling and exciting dinner experience of my life.  Because let's be real.  There aren't very many restaurants with an OMG-WOW factor, unless they're super fancy, sometimes pretentious, dreadfully long, and really expensive.  (I may or may not have been referring to some Michelin Star restaurants out there)  However, State Bird Provisions is a worthy outlier- and unlike any restaurant I've ever been to.  They have a cool imaginative concept that is very well executed, making them the talk of the town AND one of the hardest restaurants to secure a reservation.  So what's the concept?  Glad you asked.  YOU get to pick &amp; choose from an array of exotic and innovative small plates that come out on dim sum- style carts &amp; trays.  Pretty much, they're the prime example of what makes San Francisco's dining scene so exciting right now.  But wait. While half the menu is served dim sum style, the other half consists of \u00a0larger dishes where you order a la carte. \u00a0Included in this are things like their famous pancakes, the commendables (bigger entrees), and desserts.  So without boring you with every detail of every dish...  Here are my TOP 5 fav dishes of the night + dessert + other notable mentions.   BTW- I have a ton of pics in this post. Here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcyneats.com%2Fstate-bird-provisions%2F&amp;s=816afb1cb563c95e77720185f015b17e10d6273c6c2493f1f2fb920fa17c8daa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">cyneats.com/state-bird-p\u2026</a>  + Their pork belly (tapas $12) is to-die-for. It's my most absolutely, positively FAV thing here. The tender pork pieces are fat, juicy, crispy and slightly spicy. The vinaigrette is a fish sauce dressing topped with jalapenos and cilantro. Everything is so tasty and so perfectly well balanced with every ingredient in the dish.  (David Chang would approve. East coast has Momofuku, West Coast has State Bird Provisions)  + You can't come here and NOT order the State Bird with Provisions ($9 half order/ $18 full): The inside is moist, with a crispy and crunchy outer layer, which sits on top of a lemony, buttery, oniony confit. The quail is then topped off with shaved Parmesan cheese.   + The red trout ($11 half/ $22 full) is one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. \u00a0The crispy skin is lightly sauced with sweet mandarins and nutty hazelnuts. The entire dish was so perfectly balanced I was at a loss for words.  + This is the hamachi tartare constructable ($12 half/ $24 full). You can taste the freshness of the hamachi with every bite (most places use lower quality fish for tartares). Oh, and the seaweed chips are absolutely ridic. Every element of this dish is well thought out &amp; you can see the hard work that's put into every morsel.  + The Duck Liver Mousse ($6) is equally impressive and has been a staple dish ever since they opened. The mousse is smooth, light and flavorful, but what really impressed me was how well it complimented the sweet almond biscuit. Who woulda thought? This is also a MUST try.  Desserts  + The most intriguing dessert of the night is this rose-geranium ice cream sandwich ($4 half/ $8 full). It's made with pistachio and topped with a chocolate cardamom ganache. I especially enjoyed the unique texture of the \"cookie\" part of the sandwich. Honestly, it was the perfect ending to the meal.  And then THIS happened.  + It's a thai tea granita, coconut tapioca, with poached asian pear ($4 half/ $8 full). If you're absolutely stuffed by the end of your meal, then this is your go-to. It's light, delicious, and we were told it's a staff favorite!  To sum it all up:  I really enjoyed the ambiance of the open air kitchen, where you can watch all the magic happen! The cuisine here can be best classified as fusion. The flavors offer a melting pot of different cultures that demonstrate the chef's knowledge &amp; passion for local and international flavors.  The staff are super friendly and will go out of their way to explain what each dish is.You can place an order with pretty much anyone there (no matter what their role is in the kitchen).  Lastly, let's talk about reservations.   Because they're like... really.really.really hard to get.  Tables are released every night (12 am), 60 days in advance.  I can't wait 60 days.  So. The next best thing is to wait in line since they leave a certain number of tables open every night.  They open at 5:30 pm. If you get there 45min- 1hour before they open, you should be okay.  Tip: make sure you're standing in line before the Hat Store. If you are, then you should be golden! If not, try another day.  For more pics and deets, visit the blog! (link in profile)",

Agree with the other reviewers who said it's best to go as a group of 4 and try a bunch of different things. Some absolutely stand-outs: pork belly, dumplings, fried rice, salmon tartare, state bird (fried quail), sweetbreads, fried burrata. I also loved the bone marrow though it is a little peppery.

First off, getting a reservation (via the traditional sense) is near impossible. In other words, it's impossible. But if you have a credit card that has a concierge service, go that route as they will make it happen.   Don't get me wrong, I liked the food here. But it just didn't blow me away. I did like the fact that eating here is also a learning experience. Color me stupid, but I had no idea there was seafood in kimchee.   The service is 5 star and the staff right on top of things. My take, if you are just DYNG to go here, I'd say go for it. But if you are just looking for a nice meal out without having to think about what you're about to consume, then just head elsewhere.   I really would give SBP 3 1/2 stars, and I am in no mood for rounding up.",

Let's hope they get those stars.  The fiance and I decided to throw caution to the wind and our food destiny to the food deities above and went early to get on the wait list for the legendary State Bird Provisions. \u00a0Two hours later, we were rewarded.  To save everyone the tiresome, long winded review... the highlights were:  - Anchovy sesame pancake. \u00a0Get it. \u00a0Get two. \u00a0Just get it.  - State bird with provisions. \u00a0It's the namesake, so you have to. \u00a0It's like an unspoken rule and you will be judged if you do not follow.  - Salmon belly. OMG. \u00a0Fatty, tender, juicy, NOM.  - Everything in general. \u00a0If you can eye a few things first and make sure to save plenty of room to try all of the \"dim sum\" items.  Oh, and ask your server for help. \u00a0Daniel, who was our food ally of the night, came by and asked if we had already tried some small dishes and made sure we didn't miss any stellar hits. \u00a0Huuuuge thanks to him!  Recommended tips:  - If reservations are out of the question, go extra early for the wait list. \u00a0For us, going forty minutes before opening meant eating at 8pm. \u00a0If you're able to swing it, definitely try to get there as early as possible if you are swinging by town. \u00a0Head over to Japantown (or further north on Fillmore) if you need to burn some time. \u00a0It also gives you a great chance to talk more with your dining partners. \u00a0Oh, and if it's just the pair of you, ask for the counter!  - Pick a few from the menu...definitely wait on the \"dim sum\" items that are unlisted. \u00a0Even though the menu was tempting, the \"off menu\" items were definitely worth it. \u00a0If it's your first time, you must try the State Bird with provisions (that goes without saying) and, again, the anchovy pancake.  - Dessert isn't mandatory. \u00a0If you have to plot out your stomach space, as rare as it is for me to say, dessert isn't something you would feel too sad about missing out on. Even though the 'ice cream' sandwiches were tasty...it was okay. \u00a0The savory items outshone the sweets on this food trip.",

We ordered only two items from the menu - a yummy duck-ham maitake pancake and a delicious crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg dish. The rest we chose from the trays/carts of food brought around dim-sum style.   Dishes were very tasty, bright, creative, fun! Almost everything was outstanding except the pork belly which was crispy - I prefer falling apart pork belly. The duck liver mousse was decent but didn't compare to other dishes.   Some favorites include raw oyster, guinea hen dumpling, a wild mushroom dish, and hamachi-avocado on a nori cracker. For dessert, the \"ice cream sandwich,\" olive oil cake and granita were fabulous!

You know, since everyone is always raving about this place, I'd rather not be burned at the stake for giving a mediocre review of this place.  THE FOOD:  I tried the dozen quail eggs, and all I can say is - CAPERS!!! lots and lots of capers everywhere! Salty balls that make your eyes twinge and your tongue begging for water. What's up with that?  The quail however, was pleasant. But really expensive for just a tiny bite.  That french onion bread roll thing, tasted like straight grease. I was thinking it was gonna be all buttery and delicious, but it was not.  and everything else, well, either I don't remember or once again, contained too many capers.  And the service? I was really anticipating the American style dim sum, but for some reason, they just kept passing our table. 1 in 4 food people offerers or whatever you call them, (waiters/waitresses with food in their hands) would show us food, and the rest...zipped right past us. We were just there....wondering if we were invisible people. So we basically just started waiving our hands too and fro as if our lives depended on it. We gave up after a while. Only tried a few dishes and still managed to ring up ninety something dollars for what very little food we had.  Maybe it was just a weird night, I have no idea. I'm keeping an open mind, and may try it again, but only if someone wants to pay for me. :)",

And do I really need hen inside my dumpling or duck &amp; porcini mushrooms on my fried rice? Turns out, yes, YES I do. Everything we tried, from the oysters to the fried rice to the 'chip and dip' salmon tartare was sublime. No, it was F-ing delicious! The partly dim-sum style of service means the food comes fast with lots of chances to try stuff that may not appeal on a menu description. We had a tiny bit of room for dessert and the mini choco crepes perfectly closed the meal (even though we were still staring at what we didn't try on passing trays). And, for a place with so much hype and people making 5am reservations three months out, the bill was surprisingly decent -- around $90 including 2 glasses of sparkling wine.

With all these ingredients to dress up pork bellies, bone marrow, and other fine selection of meats, you have to be a nincompoop to mess it up.  I said it's a fun place to dine because you get to order their many samples and share them among your friends. Much like Chinese dim sum, each dish is different from the next, that keeps the conversation alive on the table. But unlike Chinese dim sum, all entries in SBP are new inventions and we customers are like Guinea pigs, that's how I feel. This place cost twice as much as fine Chinese dim sum, I guess the extra money goes to the service, the cleanliness of their kitchen and toilet, which are notoriously poor in any Chinese eatery.",

    "review_text": "I went to SBP with a party of five. \u00a0We all enjoyed the dim sum style of serving. \u00a0I always enjoy being able to see what I'm ordering, especially since I have some allergies. \u00a0We had a reservation at the old person eating time of 5:30 - fortunately the food all looked and smelled good enough to make us hungry at that hour. \u00a0Two members of our group tried twice. Booking at 12:01 am 60 days in advance, and finally get us a reservation for one table. \u00a0Yes, it's a pain. \u00a0The line was well down the block when we arrived. \u00a0 I may be a foodie but I am a little too cranky to wait in line forever for a table. \u00a0Damn kids on my lawn!  There were some clear stand outs in the food. \u00a0The egg custard with bacon and chili oil was the stand out of the night. \u00a0This was the dish people kept mentioning again and again during dinner. \u00a0The oysters were nicely prepared. \u00a0And the state bird was tasty, if a little greasy. \u00a0I personally really like the melted onions that accompanied this. \u00a0We also enjoyed the tomatoes with quinoa (much more interesting than it sounds), a melon dish and the beef tongue pastrami (don't knock it until you've tried it). \u00a0The duck liver mousse on almond cakes was a hit with our group too. Overall the food was very good. \u00a0  There were a few disappointing dishes. \u00a0The duck fried rice was very heavy and rich. \u00a0It was fine for a spoonful but not something I would want much more of. \u00a0The lamb and squid dish off of the menu was okay, but nothing special. \u00a0While I did not try the corn pudding (allergies!), those who did found it unpleasant both for texture and taste.   Service was very friendly and helpful. \u00a0 A few tips - ask for extra spoons if you are sharing with a group. \u00a0You can use them as serving spoons and avoid having someone put their dirty spoon in a shared dish. \u00a0Go with people who understand how to share; a.k.a. if there's a person in your group who's going to try to grab the lion's share of each small dish, put them in an inside seat. \u00a0(Does anyone get the sense there was a problem child in my group?) The restaurant can become very loud. \u00a0Be prepared to yell to be heard. \u00a0If you have an odd number of people in your group, they will try to accommodate - we each got a piece of quail and an ice cream sandwich - sweet!",

    "review_text": "What a great restaurant! The former Chef from Michelin starred Rubicon has opened his own place. \u00a0A small plates format at a great price point. \u00a0And for that price you get really, really wonderful food and service.   The format when I dined was akin to that of a Chinese dim sum restaurant. \u00a0Many smaller plates that didn't require warming were wheeled around the restaurant for patrons to pick and choose. \u00a0 A small group of larger but still modestly priced dishes that require the immediate attention of the patron are ordered ala carte and come directly to you from the kitchen. \u00a0 It worked surprisingly well, although I think they may have trouble getting people to leave. \u00a0I was tempted to stay to see what would come out on the cart next. \u00a0  I started with mushrooms that came with parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut. \u00a0A lovely way to start as the earthiness of the mushrooms was contrasted by the parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut.   Next, char-grilled chicories that came with yogurt, \u00a0and dates. \u00a0A great plate of food as the grilled chicories had taste and texture that paired perfectly with the contrasting yogurt and dates.   A larger plate of glazed pork ribs with spigarello and togarashi was sublime. \u00a0 The braised ribs had a bit of char. \u00a0The spigarello had a touch of acidity from some lemon that cut the fattiness of the heavenly ribs.   Next a half order of fried quail. \u00a0I don't particularly care for quail. \u00a0But this was different. \u00a0Great stuff and the signature plate of the place. \u00a0And for good reason.   I finished my meal with braised carrots that were wonderfully sweet. \u00a0Some slightly bitter winter greens were a perfect contrast to the carrots. \u00a0  It's places like State Bird Provisions that make San Francisco a great food city. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0Yum.",

We loved the the crispy skinned CA STATE BIRD with Provisions ($8) and the perfectly brown butter cooked Red Trout sprinkled with mandarins and hazelnuts ($11/$22). \u00a0  We also tried the Glazed Pork Ribs but due to the mushy texture and abundance of salt we preferred the swiss chard that came with it ($10).  8) \u00a0DO try a bunch of items off the trays. \u00a0  Our favorites were the Guinea Hen Dumpling in a flavorful and citrusy broth ($3) and the spicy, balanced Yubu Noodles with house made Kimchi and Smoked Egg 'Bottarga' ($7).  We also tried the more basic Golden Beet 'Caesar' (solid) ($4) and the Octopus in Tomato Salsa (rather chewy) ($7). \u00a0  9) \u00a0DO check out the seafood cart. \u00a0  I tried the Raw Oyster with Kimchi-like Kohlrabi and Sesame on top but the oyster was overpowered by the kimchi ($3).  10) \u00a0DON'T forget to save room for dessert!  I could eat the elegant Lemon Curd Ice Cream sandwiched between chewy poppy seed macarons all day long ($8). \u00a0The Black Sesame-Walnut Chocoyaki with roasted strawberries and whipped ricotta was warm and oozy with chocolate inside but next time I'm getting more ice cream sandwiches instead ($8). \u00a0  11) \u00a0DO be surprised you managed to rack up a $100 tab for 2 people (+tax and tip).  12) \u00a0DON'T regret it.  ***Too late!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finsidescoopsf.sfgate.com%2Fblog%2F2013%2F05%2F06%2Fstate-bird-provisions-christopher-kostow-danny-bowien-and-more-shine-in-2013-james-beard-awards&amp;s=7f8ba2616d1ccc3b56ef9f4112cd825a462a71f8a27f9f591adc1fbb9a60927f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">insidescoopsf.sfgate.com\u2026</a>",

The pancakes were OK, I liked the one with guacinale the most. The galic bread with burrata was pretty tasty too. Most of our dishes were lukewarm. Everything aside from the aforementioned was forgettable.  The ambiance of this place could use some work as well. I felt like with the hype &amp; prices they command, they could at least make their tables un-wobbly and make it feel less cafeteria-like on the inside. Part of eating out for me is the ambiance and intimacy of eating which there was very little of here.  We all left hungry after paying about $30 per person. My friend couldn't eat many of the dishes due to a shellfish allergy (they put it in almost everything). I probably will not return here.

The concept of having a smaller menu along with a rotating dim sum menu brought around by servers on trays is great for people with ADD and commitment issues. \u00a0We ordered a couple items off of the menu and mainly focused on what was bringing brought around. \u00a0We tried a large variety of different items and while many stood out as stellar, there were a couple that were duds. \u00a0We really enjoyed the halibut tartare with house made nori crackers. \u00a0I would seriously buy a bagful of these crackers if they were for sale. \u00a0Other standouts were the pork belly and plums, fried quail, anchovy toasts and the mushroom toasts. \u00a0The toasts were made on house made foccacia and was sublime! \u00a0Oh, the bone marrow was also fantastic!  Hmm... I would say this restaurant is worth the queuing up for. \u00a0It may feel overwhelming at first but the dishes are small enough for you to try many different things without causing palate fatigue. \u00a0Another huge boon is the very decent price point. \u00a0A must visit if you are ever in the bay area!",

The quail is coated in what I'm told is 20+ different spices the coolest of which is coarsely ground pumpkin seeds which adds great texture. Who would've thought our state bird was so damn good.  The guinea hen dumplings are based on a delicious hen confit and a broth that I found almost similar to Pho with hints of cinnamon, star anise, etc. Well done dish.  Kimchi-pork belly with tofu..mmm meltingly tender chunks of pork pair so well with the silkiness of the tofu. Nice twist on a traditional Korea hot pot.

Instead, they bring out small plates around, dim-sum style, and you can decide if you want to eat it or not. \u00a0This allows you to try out a variety of different dishes, as opposed to the 1-2 appetizers and an entree that you would normally get at regular restaurants.  It looks like the menu changes all the time, but some of the highlights from when I went were the grilled baby octopus, ricotta dumplings with shimeji mushrooms, duck liver mousse with honey cornbread, and some clam dish which had a very Japanese-style flavoring to it.

Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski both formerly of Rubicon, have really knocked one out of the park at State Bird. \u00a0Aptly they named their signature dish after it, which is a wonderfully coated delicious fried quail served over onion confit, and garnished with shaved Parmagiano-Reggiano. \u00a0Love starts here...  But the love does not end...  The onslaught of flavor comes forth with some wonderful little courses, there is so much to mention. \u00a0It just keeps coming. \u00a0You'll have to find out for yourself just how good it is, but trust me, rather than me listing out each course exhaustively, just go try it. \u00a0Though good luck with getting a reservation these days, its a little tight. \u00a0 \u00a0But trust me, if I say the best dish that I had was cured tongue with pickled veggies, then you know the rest is going to be unforgettable!  Let the lovefest begin!",

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions takes an unconventional, eat-by-the-seat-of-your pants approach to serving its Asian-inspired small plates, a sort of Western take on Chinese dim sum service. You get thrown out of your comfort zone of knowing what to expect from your meal, as there is no set menu to refer to. Instead, dinner becomes a game of chance, and a server comes around pushing the plates on a cart, asking you point blank whether you'd like to accept or reject the options. It's like a culinary version of Shark Tank. I would say overall the food here is solid, and nothing ever tasted bad. My only complaint was that something wasn't mind blowingly good, and that's only because I had huge expectations for a restaurant voted \"best new restaurant\" by the James Beard Foundation.   Amazingly good: hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini. They should call this seaweed crack. We ordered two plates of these, and we were so full.  Very good: charred Spanish octopus in tomato salsa, garlic bread burrata. The octopus was pan fried to perfection, with a nice char along the edges. The sauce was slightly sweet and spicy, similar to Korean gochujang sauce. The garlic bread burrata was deep-fried to a perfect golden form, resembling a soft, fresh and pliable cruller doughnut. The salty garlic seasoning was a perfect complement to the crispy, golden crust, and the burrata's creamy flavors and texture balanced everything out. I only wished that the bread were served a tad warmer.  Solid: smoked sturgeon pancake, tuna crudo &amp; confit with chickpeas and cumin. The smoked sturgeon tasted like a really good smoked fish and latke, nothing more and nothing less. \u00a0Same goes for the tuna crudo &amp; confit. Potato chips and chunky, creamy dips is a proven flavor pairing. The restaurant executed everything well, but not in a way that significantly elevated the dish above existing forms.  Ok: state bird with provisions, kimchi yuba noodles. I personally thought the buttermilk batter that was used to coat the quail meat was too thick and didn't allow for the delicate, gamey flavors to come through.The yuba noodles taste exactly like they sound--bland tofu skin noodles imparted with flavor from the intense pickled kimchi, but that was it. You were literally eating noodles and kimchi, and integrating the two didn't result in some powerful flavor combination.  I certainly enjoyed my dinner at State Bird Provisions. I wasn't the biggest fan of the Russian Roulette type ordering experience, but I can appreciate how this type of dinner service is more adventurous and unique than you would get a a traditional sit-down place. And the joy of stumbling upon the amazing seaweed crostini \u00a0was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had to date. I would gladly stand in line again for dinner if the opportunity ever presented itself. I'm not sure if this is THE best new restaurant in America, but it certainly is one of the best.",

Instead, I showed up at 5:30, got my name in by 6:00 (yes, we waited in line for a half hour just to get our names down), and then told we could be seated at 9:45, maybe 9:15 if people didn't show up for reservations. We decided to kill time and catch a movie at Kabuki, grabbed a few drinks at a nearby wine bar, and 4 hours later we were finally seated at 10pm. The food itself was great, albeit very rich. Lots of creamy, cheesy, meat heavy plates. There were a few let downs (steak tartare, oysters with kimchi, and duck liver mousse), but some highlights (pork belly salad, corn pancakes, salmon tartare, pork ribs). I'm most amazed by the staff, incredibly friendly, impeccable service. Even with a full house, they were attentive and made our dining experience really pleasant. After about an hour, we were finished with dinner, stuffed silly, in pain from overeating. As we left, I think 5 or 6 people thanked us for dining with them. Wonderful staff, really. I just can't forgive the insane wait time, I do hope their expansion will help avoid this.",

Voted as #1 American Restaurant of 2013 and winner of the James Beard Award; its hard to say that State Bird is anything less than extraordinary.   The food here is a fusion of all culinary cuisines ranging from American, French, Asian, etc. and prepared and served in a dim sum fashion. That's where the dishes are small plates (like tapas) and brought around on a tray or cart. You can opt to try what you see or pass it on. Each one that you choose to try, the server will mark on your table card and that card gets tallied up at the end of your meal. You can see how this could get dangerous fairly quickly.   But I must say, I think I tried everything there was to offer that day. I went with two of my friends and we shared about 10-15 different items. It's great going with friends since you get to taste a little bit of everything. The most memorable for me were the: - Chawanmushi: that one is not for sharing, you must eat it all!! So much umami that it'll make you crossed eyed - Pork Belly Plum Salad: \u00a0crispy pork belly on top of a salad with a hint of fish sauce vinaigrette?? OMG sooo good! -Salmon Collar: this dish isn't on their regular menu so if you ever see it being served, grab it quick! The meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavored by the gods.   Also, something they are known for is their World Peace Peanut Milk. It's a great way to end the meal. Expect to spend upwards of $70 each for an unforgettable meal - it's well worth it.   FRIENDLY TIP: Reservations are hard to come by so reserve early if you can. However, the other option is to come 1+ hour before State Bird opens and wait in line. They reserve a set amount of tables for walk-ins but those go fast!",

Hipster genius. Kudos to Michelin to give SBP a star.  Came here with 3 other friends. Started lining up at 5pm (30 minutes before opening) and barely got a table at 9:30pm. We went to get a drink at The Alembic and returned around 9:30pm to be seated. Excited!  Ordered a few dishes off the menu and more from the carts: - Pork belly: I have had many kinds of pork belly. This was nothing new but still quite good. It's slow cooked and fried again to have the soft-in, crisp-out contrast. A bit sweetness takes the fatty edge off.  - Salmon tartar with furikake: cured cucumber with tasty pink salmon tartar. Furikake seems to be home made too. The creamy salmon and crunchy furikake makes an awesome combination. Lightly cured cucumber is nice too.  - Smoked trout with avocado mousse: Oh smokiness + ocean + earthy avocado mousse. The highlight of the night for me.  - Black cod pancake: good filler. The fish did taste very fatty so I almost forgot it's cod.   - Bone marrow: I'm not a huge fan of bone marrow, but it was not bad. Very oily and filling though. The pepper corn and herbs gave the marrow a good kick.  - State bird: breaded and deep fried quail. The origin of SBP. Tender &amp; Juicy. Delish &amp; must have.  - SBP soda - Shiso yuzu: Out of all the fried and fatty dishes that we ordered, this soda was a life savor. Refreshing combination of shiso and yuzu is just perfect.  Will come back again to try more creations. I was very interested in the asparagus, too. Please keep up the awesome work SBP.",

    "review_text": "I've been to SBP twice now, had a great experience both times and will continue to return (even if that does mean booking reservations over a month in advance....the anticipation is well rewarded).   Given some of the poor (but uncommon) reviews I've seen on Yelp, it's apparent the concept of this restaurant isn't for everyone. But frankly, I'm OK with a few bad reviews because perhaps it will make it easier for me to get a table. :)   I personally like the dim sum concept for the food, though yes, it does mean that the food from the carts doesn't come out steaming hot. But here's the point everyone - most of it shouldn't be served hot anyway. In my experience, the dishes on the cart are supposed to be served cold or room temperature. The items that should be hot usually come out on hand carried trays immediately after coming out of the oven or off the grill. And the items you order from the menu come out immediately as well. I'm sure the staff may have off nights, but so far I've not had any complaints about the temperature of the food.  Concept aside, what I like most about SPB is the food. I feel like I'm being taught a lesson in flavor with nearly every bite. This place exemplifies the concept of eating the dish as the chef intended - everything on the plate has a purpose, just go with it and be prepared to smile (or sometime giggle, it's that good).   The place is super busy now with all the local and national hype (and I overheard one of the cooks say Monday was one of their busiest nights, fyi), so even with a reservation, we still had to wait about 20 minutes to get our table. But a glass of sparkling wine, a celebrity sighting, and plenty of food eye-candy helped passed the time easily. It also helped me keep tabs on what I wanted to try so I could pace myself through the selection.   Try it. If you don't love it, then my apologies, but thanks for making more room for me. :) I've already booked my next visit.",

If you really want to eat there- just hang out by hostess station and bug her for hour or so. \u00a0My friend got us in after an hour. We waited outside while my friend was sweet talking hostess? Or annoying her? Anyway once we got seated i was ready for my james beard meal- but honestly it was not what i expected. I felt like they took away from the beauty of the main ingredient by adding a whole buncha other ingredients and flavorings.",

Was able to get time and date after a few tries. Hit enter and server crapped out. Was never able to get in. Turns out , I was not the only one. Not many people get lucky on on line or by phone for reservations. Ended up going to Soft Opening on Oct. 19th. Was actually first in line. Got there at about 3 o'clock for 5:30 PM opening. The /12 hour wait to get in was worth it. Went in with a budget, but ended up blowing it up. Everything was delicious. Couldn't stop trying all the items being carted around. If it wasn't for myself and my wife getting full, we would of been there longer. Simply Stated. Amazing. We are going back. Probably standing in line again. The people we met in line prior all had the same feelings. we are all Fans. As of October 23, 2013, State Bird Provisions has received a Michelin Star, in addition to The James Beard Award for Best new Restaurant 2013.",

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions has been one of those unique restaurants that piqued my interest the moment it opened, but the rumors about reservations being snatched up by engineers writing clever bots quickly dispelled any hope that I would ever secure a seat at the insanely popular fusion eatery. \u00a0Luckily, my girlfriend's determination to take me there for my birthday dinner netted us a table, but only after an eventful hour-long wait on the mean sidewalks of the Western Addition.  Given the choice of a table or bar seat, I would recommend that everybody opt for the bar. \u00a0There are very compelling reasons to choose a seat overlooking the open kitchen.   1) Watching the skillful chef's preparing your dinner.  2) Getting the first (and freshest) shot at every dim sum-style dish.  3) Enjoying the personal, sushi bar experience of conversing with the chef.  As a foodie, the chef's table is the only way to go so always opt for the bar if you can!  As our first experience at State Bird, my girlfriend and I decided to sample every small dish that came out of the kitchen. \u00a0Some of our favorites included the duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, fried green tomatoes, okonomiyaki-style potato fritters, roasted persimmons on shrimp salad, the hog island oyster, the Japanese egg custard, garlic bread with burrata cheese, crispy fried pork belly with citrus salad, and the roasted butterball potatoes poached in dash served with a watermelon relish, shellfish salsa and furikake. \u00a0The eggnog ice cream sandwich and peanut muscovado milk were excellent desserts too, and I would definitely bottle the milk drink if I was State Bird's owners.  Despite these outstanding dishes, there were two that absolutely blew my mind, and would consider almost life-changing. \u00a0First, the beef tongue and horseradish-buckwheat pancake was absolutely heavenly. \u00a0The bite simply melts in your mouth and the flavors are all very rich, but balanced. \u00a0The cauliflower tabouli with seaweed aioli and local cartelized baked nori was by far my favorite dish and each bite mentally evoked images of my childhood and eating a dish similar in flavor that was prepared by my parents and grandparents. \u00a0In fact, if you've ever seen Pixar's Ratatouille, it completely reminded me of the scene when Anton Ego took his first bite of the ratatouille dish. \u00a0It was simply incredible.  Not all dishes were equally memorable. \u00a0The guinea hen dumpling in aromatic mushroom dashi was a little over-seasoned for my taste while the smoked trout gelatin with uni, celery, and green apple aioli was overly rich. \u00a0The seafood salad had too many components and while the shellfish was very fresh, I felt the flavors were too muddled. \u00a0The veggie plate was overpriced and a big boring as well, but served well as a palette cleaner. \u00a0I would probably skip these on a follow up visit.  Service was outstanding, especially at the bar. \u00a0Chefs were welcomingly and frequently inquiring about the food and our experience, sharing their techniques, and expressing their gratitude that we were enjoying their menu. \u00a0The entire staff was friendly and attentive, and showed that they really cared about (and passionate about) their craft, which went above and beyond what you'd expect from normal eateries with a professional wait staff.  We were tempted to order more dishes from the commandables menu which were generally much more significant than the dim sum dishes, but I had no room left. \u00a0Despite this, we were pleasantly full and are excited to revisit again to sample their namesake dish, the State Bird with Provisions. \u00a0Prices were surprisingly \"reasonable\" (for what it is) and the total bill came out to about $90 before tip. \u00a0It's plain to see why so many people consider this restaurant to be the best in the city. \u00a0I certainly can't disagree.  Food: 10/10  Service: 10/10  Price: $$$  Atmosphere: 9/10",

My highlights were the burrata garlic bread, the state bird, the scallion pancake with uni, and the rabbit. We had a lobster salsa that was disappointing, and a couple of porridge dishes that I probably wouldn't get again. The desserts were fantastic, especially the oolong ice cream sandwich!  I thought prices were reasonable and service was solid. It also lived up to its hype, which is often hard to do. However, to answer your question: No, I would not wait that long again.

    "review_text": "State Bird Provision pretty much had me at the name of the restaurant, I'm a sucker for interesting monickers. They totally had me at the concept. Moderately strange American tapas dishes served off dim sum carts. Why had no one ever thought of this before? It's almost genius. Being named Bon Appetit magazine's Best New Restaurant of the year made me determined to try it. One problem, they're booked solid for months these days.  We walked in on our first night in town blissfully unaware of this, four adults and one gregarious three year old. The hostess was exceptionally sweet and understanding that we'd made a long trip and though they couldn't accommodate us on that particular evening, she kindly booked one of the walk-in tables for us a week later.   By the time we returned, we had eaten in some of the Bay areas finest restaurants and I wondered how this trendy newcomer would compare. Not to worry: the food is fun, inventive, tasty and eclectic. It's also reasonably priced, so it's possible to try many dishes. We nibbled (ok, we don't ever nibble) our way through a large part of the menu, not sure there will be room to discuss them all and the offerings change quite often so it would be useless, but I'll hit the high points.  Most of the smaller plates come out on trays or carts, and you can choose which ones you'd like to sample. While the plating isn't always the most artful, it doesn't diminish from the illustrious flavors at all. If the kitchen doesn't have quite the craft of the Michelin star restaurants, it makes up for a lot with ingenuity. There wasn't a bummer in the bunch, except for two too bland desserts at the tail end. Not to worry, the two good desserts were so good I still can't stop thinking about them Especially the ridiculously addictive ice cream sandwiches.   The wonderful:  Oysters on the Half shell Haas avocado with Seafood salsa Albacore crudo and quinoa Huckleberry marinated beets with goat yogurt Sweet corn pancake Double chocolate pudding and spiced pear Plum jam ice cream sandwich   The very good:  Steak tartare with shishitos King salmon deviled egg salad Fried green tomatoes with tartar sauce CA state bird with provisions Red trout in brown butter  The disappointing:  Cheesecake japonaise Strawberry granita and tapioca   The restaurant is alive and full of happy, joyful people. That's always a good sign. Even on a rain drenched night like ours, it felt like a warm inviting house party. Service was sweet and attentive, top to bottom.  I wish I lived near State Bird, it would be a regular stop. It feels as though there will always be new and interesting tastes to explore here. It's also easy to tell the kitchen loves what they're doing, that they're having fun twisting expectations. Anytime you bend convention, you'll have some missteps along the way. It comes with the adventure, and while there weren't any on our visit I'm sure they do arise on occasion. As with all forward thinking experiences, it won't satisfy everyone but then what does?  I'm really enamored of State Bird, it was everything I hoped for and quite a bit more. A superb way to end a marvelously delectable vacation.  Best Plates: Oysters, Seafood Salsa, Albacore Crudo, Huckleberry Beets, Sweet Corn Pancakes, Steak Tartare, Salmon Deviled Egg Salad, CA State Bird, Red Trout, Double Chocolate Pudding, Plum Jam Ice Cream Sandwich   Palate: eclectic  Food - A Ambience - A Service - A Value - A",

    "review_text": "I first heard of State Bird Provisions through friends raving about it on Facebook. Months later I heard of how difficult it is to get in, nevertheless it's on my list but let's be honest after the horrors of Ramen Fest SF, I no longer can justify waiting in long lines for food. I would prefer to make eating more utilitarian by not having to wait, despite loving deliciousness.   Nevertheless this past Friday I found myself dining here after talking to an old coworker about it. For some miraculous reason he was eating here and posting about it every month. When I asked him about he he said he would give me one of the reservations he had if I was 1) about to find 2 more people to go with us 2) he could come along as well.   No problem. Totally doable. Within 2 minutes of the offer I had a table set. Hype is a funny thing, but now that I've dined here I can't say it's hype. State Bird Provisions is the real deal. Farm fresh food that is served to the table dim sum style, with a menu of delicious staples. Every bite was deliciously fresh and all in all well cooked. You won't find weird and interesting flavor profiles, but really well cooked dishes with savory and sweet pairings and the perfect seasoning.  We skipped on getting the actual State Bird did as we heard it was just so so, but everything else we had was amazing.   - started with the oysters in spicy kohlrabi kraut - shrimp toast, they don't always have it but it was my fav dish of the night - sourdough, sauerkraut pancake - maitake and duck fried rice - bacon curry - pork belly salad - ice cream sandwich.",

    "review_text": "Seems like second time is the charm. I came to SBP a few weeks ago for dinner, without a reservation, but willing to wait. A lot. No luck, all the tables were booked for the rest of the night! Boo hoo.  Second and Third times were a lot easier...we waited outside in line for about 30 minutes before they opened their doors, and voila, we got the best seats in the house!  SBP offers a completely new style of eating, where all the dishes are presented to you, dim sum style, but with much better explanations. Each person coming around has a sense of pride for the dish they are showing. Dishes range from $2 - $16, and trust me it will add up! I've eaten here twice, and both times have spent more than I'd like, but not regretting anything.  Must-haves: Garlic bread with burrata and oregano - a flaky bun of garlic bread with a huge serving of burrata melting on top from the heat of the bread. It's topped with oregano and pepper. It's like crack.  Mashed potatoes - a small iron casserole dish containing creamy mashed potatoes topped with matsutake mushrooms and shredded nori. An original combination of flavors that work so well together.  CA State Birth with Provisions - buttermilk battered quail, in a sauteed onion sauce. 1/2 order for 2 people (which is what's recommended) will not be enough.  Pancakes - their options change regularly so they may not have the same combination of flavors. My favorite was the uni pancake with ginger and a soy lime dressing, topped with micro greens.  The kitchen is definitely fast-paced, and you may feel rushed. It's ok to turn down dishes if you're the slow-eater type. They're not rushing you on purpose, I think they lose sight of the fact that we're there to enjoy a meal and not always on the go.",

    "review_text": "It took about a month to get a reservation, which was a bit annoying. I hadn't heard about the Bon Apetit article yet, so I was baffled. While my meal was tasty, I do think that most of the charm was found in the method of delivery and innovative pairings, but in many ways I can't help but feel like there was something left to be desired in the preparation and seasoning.   We got around 10-12 dishes and a couple of glasses of wine each, which I felt was more than a fair sampling of dishes for 2 people. The vegetable preparations were generally a blur, which unfortunately tells me that they weren't quite the standouts that I had hoped for. The corn pancakes with Mt. Tam were delicious, but one must pose the question: can you really lose with Mt. Tam? Nope, never. The ribs with swiss chard alone however, might have been worth the month long wait. Smoky, sweet, delicious they were so beautifully meaty. Also noteworthy was the shrimp and avocado served with nori chips. Sadly, dessert was largely a disappointment. The cheesecake was oddly savory (and not in a good way) and the toasted tapioca was nothing out of the ordinary.   The small dishes added up, but when the bill came, I was actually surprised by how reasonable it was, especially since you expect to pay a ton to dine at a place considered to be the \"best in the US\"...you know, whatever that means these days. I'm not entirely sure I'd jump through hoops to come back here, but hey, I'm glad that I was able to come here at least once and see what all the hoopla was about and form my own opinion outside of it.",

    "review_text": "Cloistered in a narrow restaurant space lining Fillmore Street, State Bird Provisions flies high above the San Francisco restaurant scene. They attack your palate with small offerings provided dim sum style as carts and trays pass by your table allowing you to see what they're cooking up that night before committing to it. A couple dishes are offered a la carte including a rotating selection of seasonal pancakes (sweet corn &amp; garlic chive shortstack with Mt. Tam cheese, yes please!) and larger \"commandables.\" I took a cautious approach with my dinner at State Bird Provisions as I wanted to make sure I didn't miss out on anything fantastic. The first thing I pulled off a tray was the warm burrata and garlic bread as the creamy burrata was softly melting over a warm, fluffy cloud of garlic bread. This dish remained to be one of my favorites through the night. Everything else I had was really good and several times I thought about pulling another serving of something off of the tray the next time it came by only to be intrigued by another offering. The wait staff was also very attentive even given the style to make sure we were seeing enough things, to ask us about our preferences, and to make sure we didn't want anything else sent out. We closed out with a dessert of a pumpkin seed cake and a peanut muscovado milk shot. If you like peanut butter desserts get the milk shot, it's delicious and a perfect pairing with something else that only sets you back another $2. The creative experience and superb culinary execution makes State Bird Provisions a definite star and worthy of multiple trips especially given the rotating menu and options.",

I dined here recently as a party of 4 hungry + adventurous eaters. Reservations were made 2 months in advance via the OpenTable system on their website. Even though I jumped on it right at the dot of midnight, I was only able to snag a 9PM reservation time. Not too late... but late enough that we were all starving upon arrival + that street parking wasn't too difficult to find in the surrounding neighborhood. At the host podium we overheard that the walk-in wait was over an hour... yikes! No wonder there wasn't a line out the door. \u00a0  Once we were seated, the servers were quick to give us a small menu of their commandable dishes (Menu part 1 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco#bEMMoOR8G5Rjd1ICjxhJRg+\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a> Menu part 2 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/state-bird-provisions-san-francisco#8aUhgGxnkMPzs3wALLcp1g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/stat\u2026</a>) then explain the system of ordering from the passing carts + trays. We then proceeded to gobble down nearly everything that came our way... with the exception of some vegetable dishes bc we're carnivores. 14 different dishes in total plus a couple drinks!

The people working there including the head chef were extremely friendly and create a very homely atmosphere. It doesn't feel like a upper class restaurant, but the food is better than any in my opinion.   My wife was coming into the city and we decided that lets see if we can get in State Bird, abide it was Monday night, the host, extremely friendly and helpful, let us know that they will have a table for us in an hour and half, we went around 6:00. so we walk around Japan Town for a while and then went back and were seated at the Chef's table, Best seats in the house, promptly at 7:30.  Best things about the Chef's table is everything comes out right in front of you, and you can decide if you want it by the time they come around to you.   Now about the Food, every bite consists of awesomeness, We order Cumin Lamb(a must have), Kimchi Yuba(good, not great), corn Shortstack pancake(good) for entree, had the the herbal tisane tea (highly recommend), and got Beehive Mousse (Good), and Granita(just Ok, won't order it again)  Dimsum: dumpling in the broth, the best broth i have ever had, we got 2 first and then wanted like a dozen more, you have to get this dim sum. Duck liver mousse - i don't even like duck liver and this was great, Halibut - Great taste and perfectly cooked.   This has become my #1 restaurant right now, will be coming back if i can ever get a reservation or will try my luck at walking in early on weekdays. .

For desserts, we had the ice cream sandwich and buckwheat bao, both were underwhelming, considering that everything else was so tasty.

Then, after a couple of days, we received an email from them saying that it was all a mistake, the didn't really mean to give us a reservation. But they have this new reservation system they \"are thrilled about as it incorporates many new features that will improve our guests' experiences.\" Well it sure didn't improve our experience. These people are clueless and way too full of themselves. I wish I could give them zero stars.",

Since we didn't have a reservation we lined up at 5pm (by this time the line for 40+ people deep!) and quoted a 10:45pm sitting. Not the most ideal, but there was obviously a ton of demand. The guys at the front desk were helpful and gracious despite some people giving them a hard time about the wait. We came back just before 10pm and were able to seat us at a table right away. It was very easy to get caught up in all the great looking plates coming by, but in the end we ordered a bunch of plates dim sum style and a few from the menu. We had: dried beef with chili, corn, tomato &amp; basil, salmon tartar, the cheese pancake, the state bird and wrapped up with the icre-cream cookie. The flavors and textures of the tartar was a nice surprise and I loved the build-your-own style of the cheese pancakes. They came out so warm and gooey. The service was fantastic - everyone we interacted with was really friendly and approachable. Towards the end of the night I scored a high five for guessing some of the ingredients in the dessert :-) On the way out, the guy at the front desk shared details about the recent renovations and helped me get my jacket on. I will definitely be back to experience State Bird again. Fingers crossed we can snag a reservation, but if not I'll definitely be lining up earlier than 5pm!",

Humble shades from the owners and a distinct ethic of allowing the food to thrive leaves guests of this establishment leaving with a sense of wonder.   Imaginative, thoughtful, and integrative - the full circle experience at State Bird is one of a kind.  We arrived at the early onset of dinner, around 6, mid week and found stools at the bar. The absolute best seats in the house. Front row to the 10 digit wizards.  State Bird Provisions is a modern take on dim sum. Small dishes pirouette through the down to earth interior leaving you with a constant strain in your neck. Arriving hungry will leave your first few minutes loading your table like a carb to a diet.  Highlights:  The fried garlic bread with warm burrata is decadent. Every piece of warm dough clings to the healthy portion of burrata which nests in the middle of the dish as the diva.  The duck liver mousse with almond biscuits were a perfect in between. Rich and eloquent, the mousse has a back of the mind saltiness that allows you to truly appreciate the miniature biscuits.  We couldn't miss the namesake of the establishment, so a half order of the State Bird was easily ordered. Crisp, well portioned, and a finger fighting plate.  Came in with very little expectations, but left knowing that one of the best meals in San Francisco can still be affordable, organic, and up to par with the heavy hitters within the walls of our 7x7 city.  By far one of the best restaurants in San Francisco.   Go. Eat. Enjoy.",

Since we had a late reservation, we were given the heads up that dim sum service would be slowing down, but were shown the menu and invited to order from it. \u00a0There was so much stuff on the menu that sounded amazing (more amazing than some of our earlier picks), but we were just too full to try them.",

Make sure you don't miss - the burrata on garlic bread - the state bird of course - the almond biscuits with duck liver mousse  Most of the menu keeps changing, but the pork belly and the grilled lamb are really good too (but not always offered) I am not the biggest fan of the pancakes or the quail eggs and to be honest, haven't given any of the veggies much of a chance.  Definitely a must-try place, just be prepared to wait, but hey, you can watch a movie at Kabuki right around the corner.",

We didn't turn away a single person who offered us food. Highlights of the night for me: 1. State Bird with Provisions (duh the namesake) 2. Pork belly! (drooling as I type) 3. Crispy Quinoa (don't know what they actually called it but that's what it was to me) 4. bone marrow (OMG) 5. ice cream sandwiches!  I'm glad I went with 3 other people instead of just 1 cause that meant we had more room to taste a variety of plates. Total came out to about $60 each which I thought wasn't bad.

Our favorites:  Homemade potato chips with roe and creme fraiche: only complaint is it only comes with around 6 chips!  Hamachi on a crispy nori chip: We ordered two of these... so good. \u00a0Tastes like hamachi poke.  Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: so rich and tasty. \u00a0Be sure to ask for extra biscuits at no charge. \u00a0You'll need them for the extra mousse.  Mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime sauce: a little like a Korean seafood pancake with a fresh urchin on top.  Tofu custard with bacon: better as a dessert  Quinoa porridge with wild mushrooms and ginger: like Chinese rice porridge, but with tons more flavor.   Guinea hen dumpling: Steamed dumpling with lots of flavor. \u00a0Love the mushroomy broth.  Braised Pork Belly: excellent sauce, perfectly cooked skin  Good, but just above average:  CA state bird with provisions: their specialty. \u00a0It's a fried quail with a lemony, leeky sauce on the bottom. \u00a0Pricey and less meat than two chicken wings.  Garlic Bread with Burrata: like a Chinese fried donut at the dim sum restaurants, but with a glop of cheese.  Grilled beef &amp; broccoli with umeboshi and bonito  Guava tres leches: tres leches with a side of guava jelly and whipped cream.  Oysters with chili oil, sesame seeds: $2 each. \u00a0It was good, but I might be spoiled with the Hog Wash at Hog Islabd Oyster Depot.  Skip:  Grilled beef broccoli with umeboshi and bonito: Good, but a little tough and pricey for 8 cuts of steak. \u00a0 Might want to order the bone marrow instead.  Pork spare ribs: a little burnt, average flavor  Corkage is $25 for a 750ml bottle, $50 for a 1.5L bottle.",

Of course it was Thanksgiving Eve, so I had less competition! \u00a0And then the 60 day wait began....  The restaurant exterior does not have a number or a sign. \u00a0You just have to know which one it is. \u00a0There was no line in front but I suspect many people were waiting next door over cocktails at the proprietor's new restaurant. We arrived 5 minutes early and pushed past the few walk-ins who eagerly waited for an opening. \u00a0At first I wasn't sure if the online reservation was worth it, but as I saw people getting frustrated and anxious, I knew it was. \u00a0  The restaurant is not an elegant one but is definitely upscale, modern and casual. Wear nice jeans if you'd like. It was very befitting of a chic foodie kitchen restaurant. \u00a0 Clientele is definitely young lovers of food experiences. \u00a0No kids in sight. \u00a0I would have loved to have some mom try to give her kid Quinoa-Cauliflower.  Many people describe this as a dim sum style restaurant. \u00a0Other than that the food comes out on trays and they stamp your menu for each plate, the comparison stops right there.. In fact the servers are fabulously informative about the dishes which need lots of explanations and often require you to repeat the name. \u00a0Our server, Luke, was very helpful with our wine choices and helpful in recommending dishes that we should NOT pass on that evening. \u00a0In fact I highly recommend studying up beforehand on the menu and remind yourself what you must have. \u00a0The \"provisions\" of the evening rotate, but the main classics \u00a0as well as the toasts and pancakes are pretty standard and you order them with your server. \u00a0We only passed on one dish all evening, a persimmon dish. We passed mostly because we were stuffed.  In the end, we had 8 provisions and 3 ordered dishes along with the dessert milk: I am putting them in my order of preference: 1.Duck Mousse with Almond biscuits 2.Pork Belly Citrus Salad 3.Shrimp &amp; Potato 'okonomiyaki' 4.Steak Tartare on sunchoke toast 5.State Bird and Provisions 6.Guinea Hen Dumpling 7.Quinoa - Cauliflower Tabouleh 8.Trout 9.Hog Island Oyster 10.Egg Custard 11.Snacking Pork with Apple Mostardo  The only thing I would say is that the oysters were just not a wow dish to me, but very tasty! \u00a0The egg custard with the pork belly crisp was very good and surprised me. \u00a0Lastly my dining partner and I thought the Snacking Pork was slightly dry. \u00a0Other than that, I can't be too critical.  Service was informative and attentive, and actually funny and entertaining. \u00a0We were not rushed, but I loved the fact that the dinner moved along fairly at a nice pace and did not leave long lulls.  There were several dishes we didn't get to, so we'll definitely be back for more.",

So when my friend asked if I wanted to join a last minute reso, I jumped and said YES!  I've been waiting to try State Bird for months, and it did not disappoint. I love the idea of New American/ fusion style dim sum. It lets you try a variety of small plates.   They have a set menu that you can order from, and a few rotating carts that go from table to table with a variety of small plates. For a table of four, they recommended starting with 3 or 4 dishes from the menu and grabbing whatever looks good from the carts.  DELICIOUS: * CA State Bird - which is a fried quail, in case you didn't know what the state bird of California was. Very juicy and tender. The cheese and onions on top elevated the dish to another level. * Pork Chawanmushi - must get this! I could eat a couple of these by myself. * Guinea Hen Dumpling - I didn't think I would like this, but the broth was very light and refreshing. * Spicy Dungeness Yuba with Kimchi - I honestly don't like crab that much, but this dish was delicious. Spicy yuba noodles with a nice kimchi kick. * Duck Liver Mousse - I love duck liver and this mousse was amazing. I only wish there were more biscuits to eat it with. * Roasted Bone Marrow - this is a must here. The bone marrow simply melts in your mouth and the chanterelle mushrooms on top were great.  JUST OKAY: * Brussel Sprouts - These were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. * Salmon Tartare - Just okay. I didn't really enjoy the texture - tasted too mushy for me. * Sea Urchin Pancake - The uni was fresh, but overall the dish felt too rich and heavy. * Garlic Bread and Burrata - Two of my favorite things, but combined? Not so great. * Warm Apricot &amp; Plum Mochi - Sounds like it would taste delicious, but I wasn't a fan.  * Poppy-seed Ice Cream Sandwich - Light, creamy ice cream.   The service was excellent and overall I really enjoyed SBP. I can't wait to come back here - I just need to find friends who already have reservations!",

The oysters:  Straight up, oysters are not my thing. \u00a0This was my date's pick. \u00a0They were ok, but that's just me, &amp; not a reflection of the restaurant.  The duck liver mousse w almond biscuits:  The smooth as silk mousse juxtaposed w the almond biscuits; very nice &amp; different. \u00a0Just so good. \u00a0If you usually do a pate, order it.  The garlic bread (affectionately known as \"sex bread\") w burrata:  I anticipated to be blown the eff away w this, because if it's called \"sex bread,\" it better be mind blowing, right? \u00a0Well...if this is sex bread, then you're just not having good sex. \u00a0It was VERY good, yes. \u00a0Sexual? \u00a0No. \u00a0I love burrata, so it was a must order. \u00a0And the burrata was well done. \u00a0A staple dish for sure.  The State Bird:  I basically expected the heavens to part &amp; God to come down to my table &amp; shake my hand when I bit into this dish. Did that happen? \u00a0Of course not. \u00a0But, I love fried bird. \u00a0So it was a win with me. \u00a0Nicely seasoned, crispy on the outside, tender inside. \u00a0Didn't bowl me over, but it was tasty &amp; I will order it again. My date, on the other hand, was very dissatisfied w this dish.  The ice cream sandwich:  Ok, come on. \u00a0It's an ice cream sandwich, albeit deconstructed. \u00a0What's not to love? \u00a0Again, my date did not appreciate this at all. \u00a0But, in retrospect, I'm starting to wonder if he's not a little cray cray.  All in all, I feel I need to dine here a couple more times, to try more dishes, before I make any proclamations. \u00a0Like State Bird &amp; I are dating, &amp; this was only our first date. \u00a0I said yes to a second. \u00a0The ingenuity of the dishes, the dim sum style service, &amp; even the hype make it worth a visit for sure. \u00a0I'm looking forward to date #2.",

Most dishes that were passed around never made it to our table, so there were a lot of things we couldn't try. \u00a0Our server was so preoccupied that we barely got any attention to request any dishes. \u00a0All the other staff remarkably seemed to dodge any eye contact whatsoever.   The oysters were mediocre, the chips and dip were so-so, the quinoa salad tasted like it came from whole foods, the duck liver mousse was just okay this time (very, very gamey), the guinea hen dumpling was insanely salty and chewy, and there were probably a couple more that I'm forgetting.  The anchovy pancake was the best thing of the night, but it wasn't that great and it took a half hour to come out.  The sweetbreads were disgusting. \u00a0They tasted like fryer oil and breading, and were unpleasantly chewy rather than tender and creamy.  The hearts of palm salad was so salty it was inedible. \u00a0We had to send it back, but that took 10 minutes because we couldn't get anyone's attention. \u00a0  Really mediocre meal and bad service. \u00a0State Birds, I'm pretty disappointed, and I'm not sure I want to come back.",

Yesterday was the night I decided to try to get into the place and succeeded! I went at 6pm put my name down then went home and hung out until 8:30 when my table was ready, uh yeah crazy...But it was an amazing, fun experience cuss we got the best seats in the house! Right next to the chef all night and right in front of all the food being made and first to see what was leaving the kitchen. They serve their food dim sum style which was fun. You need to go in knowing you will be spending a crap load of money and just enjoy it. It's so hard to say no when it looks so good my eyes won over my full stomach. Ok best dishes for me, beef tar tar, the state bird of course, garlic bread with barata, we had two!, and the crunchy bird seeds chocolate cloud dessert, my friend's eyes closed while eating it. Everything was good but if I were to pass on something next time, the lobster is just ok, the fried green tomatoes itself was good but I just am not a fan of the peppers around it...Service was beyond what you will expect. I think I had five people attending to us, that included the chef, manager, and a cook, where would you get service like that?..I hope I will be lucky enough to sit at the kitchen counter next to Chef again, it was fun.",

Not to mention the kitchen is open to watch them work and they did not hold back on cost of this equipment or amount of staff they have on. Those rolling dollies of State birds (Quail) and delicious oyster, baby romaine, pork belly..... Yes Yes and Yes we did not say no to one item that passed us to the point we had no more space to put anything.   After everything was said and done I was expecting a 300 maybe 350 dollar bill..... Um not even close, 165 dollars.... Um ok no problem. Not sure if the extremly nice staff might have forgot to check a few items or it was just that inexpensive but holy hell when in SF this is a MUST!!!! \u00a0  Definitely worth the wait in line since reservations are not even a possibility, and while waiting there is a great local bar around the corner The Library awesome drinks!!!",

    "review_text": "For any of you Foodies you probably have already heard of State Bird (what I've heard it commonly referred to as) the James Beard Best New Restaurant WINNER for 2012.   It's a very small intimate restaurant (plan to call 60 days ahead to get a resi then when you're there make your next resi) and that's part of the charm. For a non adventurous eater be bold and try whatever is available. Save room for the cart vs. ordering too much off the menu prior to seeing the amazing cart options. I usually say save room for dessert however here I think the starters and entree's are so fabulous you may prefer to try everything vs. saving room for dessert. My second visit was my birthday dinner and we didn't hold back, trying everything on the menu and a few things more than once!   My favorite's include: State Bird (it's a must try), Curried Scallops, Tuna Tartar (I normally don't like this dish but loved it here), Guinea Hen Dumplings, Spare Ribs, &amp; Steak &amp; Tartar. \u00a0Coming from New York where hot new restaurant's come with attitude the team at SB couldn't be nicer. Forrest is the host who's beyond adorable, patient and helpful and the chefs (was able to meet and chat with Glen the Sous-Chef during our wait) were also super friendly and approachable. \u00a0State Bird is not only AMAZINGLY delicious, unique , fab food but also amazing people. What a fabulous spot, totally worth the 2 month wait!

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions - 7/18/2014  Wow, the hype and difficulty of securing a reservation here are well substantiated. We made our reservations 60 days out for an 8pm dinner on a Friday. We arrived about 10 to the hour and were told that they were still seating some of the 7:30 reservations, but we were handed a drink menu by the host. There isn't much room to stand and wait by the front door, but it never seemed to get too overcrowded. I was a bit shocked at the number of people that walked in without reservations and asked if they could be seated. \u00a0Who walks into the hardest restaurant to score a reso and asks if they are accepting walk-ins? \u00a0At least the host was polite.   Finally we were seated at around 8:15. Our server was great and he explained the menu and the ordering process. Basically you can order off the menu - pancakes and commandables, or you can pick and choose from the food carts and trays passed through the restaurant. He suggested we order a few items off the menu and a couple of the random dishes. Here's the rundown...  From Menu: -Stone-Ground Whole Grain Fiscalini Cheddar Pancake, Heirloom Tomato and Roasted Garlic -CA State Bird with Provisions (fried quail with pickled onions and fontina(?) cheese) -Maitake &amp; Duck Fried Rice -1/2 Dozen Cast Iron Quail Eggs, Salsa Cruda, Pimenton Aioli  From Food Cart: -Oysters -Udon Noodles -Garlic Bread with Burrata cheese (best garlic bread of my life) -Duck Liver Mousse with almond cakes  For Dessert: -Olive Oil \"Ice Cream\" Sandwich, Fraises des Bois, Oregano and Aged Pecorino  Amazing food with such interesting ingredients paired together. While everything exceeded my expectations, my favorite dishes of the night were the CA State Bird, Duck Fried Rice, Garlic Bread, and of course the Olive Oil Ice Cream Sandwiches.   We brought our own bottle of wine and the $25 corkage was very fair. To be able to eat this well for just over $100 (pre tip) for two people seems like an absolute bargain. Can't wait to come back here next time we are in town.",

I did like the very crunchy crutons that came with it.  tuna tartare &amp; quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli-very refreshing. I don't usually like quinoa, but went really well with the tuna to give it that crunch  duck liver mousse with almond biscuit-love, love, love. The biscuit was so moist and to add the liver mousee just made it even tastier  garlic bread with burrata-eat quick cuz the cheese gets hard, but this was good  haas avocado with seafood 'salsa' -gross. all you can taste is salsa from the jar.   kimchi-pork belly with tofu &amp; clams-very comforting. I wanted more.  Things we ordered off the menu:  sweet corn &amp; garlic chive \"shortstack\", with mt. tam-so good! What isn't good with corn and garlic, but wish it was a little more crispy  CA state bird with provisions-fried perfectly. The batter was so good and the bird was tender. Must try this!  cumin lamb with scallions, dates &amp; snap peas-I dont eat lamb, but my friends said flavor was good, but way too oily  cast iron mushrooms, eggplant, dahl &amp; cauliflower-colored pickle cauiflower with smoky mushrooms, which was really good, but the egg plant was blah and very soggy.

I wanted to see how this place matched up with Rich Table.  First wave: Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame (oh, so fresh), hamachi-avocado on a seaweed cracker (tasted really good), sourdough, saurkraut, pecorino and ricotta (maybe my favorite), steak tartare lettuce wraps (pass), duck &amp; sottocenere croquettes (very light for something fried), and duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (I've had better pate).   The first three were the best of the round.  The second wave included: garlic bread with burrata (nothing special), hearts of palm with avocado, pomelo and tahini-chili oil (forgettable), pork belly grape salad (very good pork belly), spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (definitely would get again!), and quail eggs on a cast iron skillet with apple, sunchokes and mt. tam [?] (this was uniquely awesome).  Next round was the famed CA state bird wit provisions (not as good as what it should be), grilled asparagus with walnuts and pecorino (skip), red trout with mandarins and hazelnut brown butter (I enjoyed this one a lot), and grilled beef and brussel sprouts with umeboshi and bonito (everyone loved it...I thought it was ok).  For dessert we had spiced cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwiches (decent), black pepper pecans wit plum fudge (earthy), and guava tres leches with chevre creme fraiche, rhubarb and pistachio (easily my favorite). We also added on a couple other dishes.  The meal was good and fun, but not as good as it's hyped up to be. The savior was the cute waitress, Penelope (majestic name), who was super knowledgeable about the menu and was super nice. She easily bumped my review up to 4 stars!",

    "review_text": "I wouldn't wait 3.5 hours again: 1.5 hours before doors opened at 5:30pm (thankfully waiting outside during December in California is not too painful- it also helps that they served us some deliciously thick hot chocolate) only to be offered a seat for 2 hours later (shocking, but we figured we'd come this far and couldn't turn back at that point). But if you can manage to get in without a crazy wait (i.e. make a reservation months in advance), State Bird is worth checking out for the experience. The dim sum style push cart tapas is novel in these circles- and functionally, pretty awesome- how can you say no after getting a whiff of the pork belly? What's even better is sitting at the counter and being able to watch the chefs work their magic and talk to them directly- what you making there? Can I get one of those too? Everyone was super attentive, informative and friendly.  As for the food itself- I found it a bit anticlimactic after that ridiculously long wait. The namesake- the fried quail- was over-fried. There wasn't much juice or tenderness inside. The roasted squash on gruyere pancake sounded amazing- but was underwhelming in flavor and unmemorable. The oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut &amp; sesame (too much kraut and sesame killed the oyster flavor) and guinea hen dumpling (tasty dashi but bland filling) were similarly simply unmemorable. My favorites were the duck fried rice (the only \"American\" sized dish-- very nice touch with the added egg drops and tender snow pea shoots) and the pork belly topped with a Vietnamese inspired citrusy sauce and cilantro (so tender, fatty and a great mix of flavors).   Come for the experience (not so much the food). And if you do find yourself waiting, grab some drinks at the Progress, the new sister spot next door.",

They have a sparkling Riesling by the Magnum bottle at around 100 usd which I think is a great deal, especially if you're with a big group.   The second time round, I went as a group of 4. I was devastated to find that my favorite Asian Chicken vegetarian salad was NO LONGER ON THE MENU!!!!! ---- this, along with Commonwealths salads, are the ONLY two salads I would dream about in the Bay Area. With that said, food was still good although service seemed a bit rushed.  The fried \"statebird\" was not bad, very well cooked, but the highlights of both meals were:  - Housemade chips, trout roe &amp; horse radish creme fraiche (YUM!) - \u00a0Hamachi on crispy Nori - Duck liver mousse with Almond biscuits (can have 100 of these!) - Rabbit and mushroom curry with Roti (I don't usually eat rabbit but the sauce for this was just BOMB.COM)  DO NOT forget the milk dessert that taste like a snicker bar in a small glass...

    "review_text": "Loves: -Interior of the restaurant; it's small, but they do a lot with the space and manage to make it feel comfortable and inviting.  -Service is very friendly. Sitting in front of the prep kitchen was pretty awesome. -The concept of dim sum with California cuisine. It's a great idea since it gives you the opportunity to try a bunch of different dishes, which allows you to perhaps try things you wouldn't have tried before. -Eggplant: This dish was great balancing game. There was a balance between the soft, mushy interior texture of eggplant and the crispy fried panko? (I'm guessing) bread crumbs on the exterior as well as a balance between sweet, acid, smoky, and savory flavors.  -CA state bird: Probably the best preparation of quail that I've had. Previous forays into quail have resulted in poor attempts to eat a stringy, tough to eat bird. This quail was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. -Corn pancake: I am a sucker for sweet corn. Pancakes were very yummy. I am a bit regretful that I didn't try more of them.  Dislikes: -Pork belly with kimchi and tofu: Pork belly was tough and overcooked :( . The tofu actually tasted better than the pork belly. I did like the kimchi'd strawberry they had though.  -Seafood salsa: Seafood was bland, salsa was nothing to write home about.  Okay: -Duck liver mousse: Mousse was smooth and pleasant tasting and wasn't too grainy or metallic tasting the way that liver can be. I really liked the little almond cakes they had with it. -Steak tartare: Good, but not great.  I had initially written this reviews as 3 stars, but after recalling every dish that I ate, I remembered that I actually enjoyed the majority of things and so I bumped up my review one star. I think my issue was that I left the restaurant feeling a little unsatisfied, a little underwhelmed. I think I might have been expecting too much in that I wanted every dish to blow me out of the water. I think I was also expecting a bigger variety of dishes to come out via the dim sum carts, but realistically, this is difficult to do considering the cuisine.",

I might even toss in the concept \"gastropub\", because the lack of pretension, as well as paired down but frenetic service, certainly simplifies expectation - just grab what excites you, and pass on anything, without guilt. \u00a0The nature of dim sum means this can get spendy in a short period of time, but it's important to romp through the typical menu, and try one or two things off the specials menu. \u00a0The quail, the beef, the lamb, oh my.... \u00a0I am fairly certain it's a worthwhile meal, and a proper way to spend hard earned money. \u00a0The only thing is that it may be addictive - you might want to save 2x as much, because you will want to go back. \u00a0For such a hip and in demand restaurant, it is nice they allow access by refraining from booking all their tables... It used to be 5p, but show up by 4.30p (or earlier) to hopefully guarantee a first seating when they open at 5.30p. \u00a0If you can get there earlier, or have one hold the spot for more, it's a wise idea. \u00a0It's truly worth the wait - just don't expect Michelin level china or tablecloths. \u00a0This is a room full of people truly excited to be there, proud of what they are producing, and just as excited as the people coming to wait in line.",

The inside of the restaurant was cheery and a bit kitschy, reminding us of an old school diner. It was fun having the option to order from the \"dim sum\" trays and/or from the menu. So many choices, and everything was made fresh from the open kitchen!  We tasted the following provisions: - kimchee yuba - glazed pork ribs - sweetbread meatball - red trout - cast iron quail eggs - ricotta dumplings - smoked sturgeon pancake - Seville orange granita, lime curds, and Asian pear  All the flavors popped for us. In fact, some dishes were too salty. To us, the stars of the night were the red trout (perfectly cooked) and ricotta dumplings (reminded us of burrata.) Both dishes included hazelnuts - the crunch contrasted nicely with the soft texture of the fish and dumplings. We appreciated the addition of fresh herbs to many of the dishes and the piping hot temperature of our main proteins.  We are glad State Bird Provisions takes reservations, but we wish they were on Open Table...   We'll be back!",

I was looking in december for reservations in jan, hoping to take the bf here for his bday, but as I refresh the page every second, the only things coming up were already for feb! darn! but lucky me, one day i stumbled upon a wed reservation for the 12th! whoohoo, the only night we have off and the week of vday! perfect!  so the two month wait began.   we arrived around 5 so we could run a quick errand and there was a line already formed! but bwahaha we have a reservation so we got to walk righttttt up at 5:30.  the restaurant was very new american/hipster, communal feel.  on to the food  ordered off the paper menu: fried quail- crispy light, but a little tooooo citrus-y bone marrow- i guess i've never tried bone marrow so i can't compare it but it was ok? salty, glutenous, buttery. eat it with toast and mushrooms.   the ones that came around duck liver mousse- bf really liked it, his favorite of the night. very very rich, too rich for me but it was good. salmon tartare- not special but it was good, with cucumbers and crunchy quinoa. i liked this one. chips with homemade sourcream- bf chose this, but i don't like sour cream, meh filler food, skip it pork ribs- it WAS fall off the bone...but the flavor was not there... pork belly in fish sauce broth- best part was the grapes...pork belly was something our parents could make...too tough, sour...skip hamachi avocado on crunchy nori- this one is good, creamy, light, crunchy. dumpling in broth- once again was okay? and once again too citrus-y? the dumpling was different, forgot what kind of stuffing was in there..unique butttt eh chocolate roll cake for dessert- super rich, interesting rice cracker bits but nothing special.   SO, unfortunately maybe I was overhyped about this place and it wasn't what we expected. The dishes all had very similar tastes and style. Citrus-y and a cream-like texture...love the concept, it was very fun to pick what we wanted to eat and to see the dishes coming around, but sadly the food didn't do it for us. Service was nice and friendly though. For two, we shared about 9 dishes, and a drink each. $150 with tip. not bad  oh parking is pretty easy at 5/530. oh and the place is pretty loud...kinda hard to hear anything without having to raise your voice..",

Unfortunately, when my fiancee and I finally visited a few weeks ago we were seriously disappointed by their most recent menu. I can't help but wonder if all the hype has gotten to them!  oysters: they were okay. I personally prefer my oysters less garnished. (skip) guinea hen dumpling: the broth was a little overly sour but otherwise I liked it (get) guanciale chawanmushi: flavor of the chawanmushi wasn't quite right... didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought I would (skip) garlic bread with burrata: I could barely taste the garlic and there was too much pepper on the bread. burrata was very chewy. (skip) duck liver mousse with almond biscuit: my fiancee absolutely hated this dish! I on the other hand did enjoy the duck liver, but the sad truth is that pungent pate does not pair well with sweet biscuits. Trust me on this one. (skip)  state bird: it was good, not great. WHAT CAN I SAY? my fried chicken standards (applies to quail too) are high! (get/skip) maitake and duck fried rice: when you put mushrooms and duck together, it's hard to go wrong, but I was surprised this dish wasn't an umami orgasm in my mouth, because it wasn't. I also personally thought the ratio of veggie to rice was off. (get/skip)  eggnog ice cream sandwich: Ice cream didn't taste like eggnog. It tasted more like mild custard. Also they put raisins or some kind of disgusting fruit in the ice cream. Overall a very unremarkable dessert. (skip)  State Bird seems more to me a study in attempted creativity than true cooking excellence. Execution was definitely not on point. Will not be returning.",

Service 4.5 Stars Service was great. \u00a0It seems we didn't have a specific waiter for our table. \u00a0Different members of staff just came around to check-in with us. \u00a0Everyone was really nice, professional, and NO attitude. \u00a0  Ambiance 4 stars Not too loud or quiet, they did a cool job of the remodeling.  Food 3.5 Stars There is a lot of hype regarding the food. \u00a0I thought the food was good, but not outstanding. \u00a0Everything was perfectly cooked... nothing too dry, overcooked, undercooked etc. \u00a0 The memorable dishes of our dinner were the Himachi with avocado on a Sesame cracker, the quail egg with halibut, and the grilled octopus (and I don't really like octopus). \u00a0All well cooked, great flavors. \u00a0I did think the sesame cracker was a bit too thick and crunchy for a delicate topping as Himachi. \u00a0I liked the State Bird Provisions (fried quail) as it was perfectly cooked... crisp breading and moist and juicy on inside. I didn't care for the cauliflower dish that much. \u00a0The pork spareribs were also perfectly cooked (tender), not that meaty of a cut though seasoned well. \u00a0Would not get this again, simply because there was nothing unique to them and I could cook this at home. For dessert, I had the green tea ice cream sandwiches half size. \u00a0The dough was a french style macaroon. \u00a0Good.  Concept 4 Stars Dim Sum style serving (they come around with carts and there is also a menu). Gives you a chance to try lots of different dished without spending $30-35/plate on a dish that you may or may not like. \u00a0Great concept.  Price 4 Stars I thought prices were reasonable for this type of dining experience. \u00a0It would be one of the main reasons I wouldn't mind going again for dinner. \u00a0Our bill was $100 for 2 people with 1 glass of wine, probably $120 if my guest was drinking that night. \u00a0Not bad. \u00a0We left full enough and not overly stuff with about 8-9 dishes.",

The food was really TASTEFUL. \u00a0I had lots of favorites that night and was amazed as to how much flavor those little dishes had. \u00a0My taste buds were awaken that night! \u00a0I wish I had room to try desserts, but my husband and I kept trying everything they brought us. \u00a0My favorite that night was the Guinea Hen Dumpling w/Aromatic Broth, it was so good! \u00a0My least favorite was the Duck Liver Mousse. \u00a0The biscuit was good, but the mousse, just not my thing. \u00a0Here is a list of what we had (missing a few since I have more pictures than what I have listed, lol).  My Favorites!  -CA State Bird w/ Provisions (Fried Quail) this was perfect!  -Guinea Hen Dumpling w/Aromatic Broth (savor and taste every bite, it's so good, my mouth watered every time they walked passed our table)  -Spicy Steak Tartare (this was spicy but really good!) -Smoked Trout-Avocado 'Chip &amp; Dip' (yummy!) -Pork Belly Plum Salad (OMG so good!! all I needed was rice) -Raw Oyster w/Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut &amp; Sesame -Garlic Bread w/Burrata  We also had these dishes, which was okay, but my husband loved. -Duck &amp; Fontina Croquettes -Guanciale Chawanmushi -Duck Liver Mousse w/Almond Biscuit",

    "review_text": "The best dining experiences I've ever had in San Francisco.   My fiance and I decided we wanted to go to state bird provisions early enough that we didn't need a reservation. We got there on a Saturday night about 20 minutes before opening and there was already a 20 person line waiting ahead of us. 15 minutes later we felt pretty good about ourselves because there were another 20 people behind us in line. 5 minutes later a chef from the restaurant came out and asked if anyone had reservations. He asked that anyone with reservations please line up in another line. Of course, the 20 people behind us all had the forethought to make a reservation and immediately moved to another line.  Eventually, the doors of the restaurant opened and we were in the last group of people who didn't get seated. The restaurant isn't tiny but the 30 people with reservations filled up a large portion of the restaurant. When we finally got to the front of the line we were told our table would be ready in 3 hours (8:30pm). We decided to just hang out in the area and grab a cocktail before our table was ready. Around 7:30pm they called us and we immediately ran down the street to the restaurant.   I expected we'd end up sitting in the dining area but it was basically full and we had to sit at the bar instead. I assumed sitting at the bar would be a kind of crappy experience but I couldn't be more wrong. You only get the PRIVILEGE to sit at the bar if you DON'T have a reservation. The huge advantage of sitting at the bar is you're 5 feet away from the chefs having a great time making amazing food.  Unlike your typical kitchen, these chefs are basically working autonomously. They're prepping a handful of dishes on their own and they're not waiting for anyone else on the line to hand them the next thing they need. You'd think this would be inefficient but it just works. They're making small dim sum plates for a small restaurant. The best part of this is they have time to stop, hangout, talk to everyone sitting at the bar and the rest of the staff because no one is waiting on them to finish prepping a some part of a dish.   We ended up meeting everyone who was working there. It was an extremely relaxing and delicious experience. We'd randomly see a chef cooking something and we'd say \"Hey! watcha making?\", \"Oh this? this is a something something something something, want me to make you one too?\", \"hell yeah!\". This pattern of randomly asking about/receiving food continued for about an hour and we were absolutely stuffed. In addition to asking about what they were making, we also asked about how they had prepped things. My fiance and I are huge foodies and love to know how the sturgeon fish was brined/smoked and what the chefs love to cook when they're not working. We got all sorts of advice on topics ranging from cooking technique to favorite dives in the city (the chefs literally found a piece of paper and wrote everything down).  Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing staff, what more could I asked for? Well, the bill was a hell of a lot less than I thought. I'm used to paying too much for great food. I'm happy to pay for good food cause I love it that much. My bill at State Bird Provisions, $90 for two people including drinks. I thought something must be wrong, they must have missed the beer or something. Nope, fancy fusion dim sum is just a little more expensive than regular dim sum and just as filling.  Totally worth the 2 hour wait, 5 stars without a doubt.",

Plenty of ooh's &amp; aah's will be said.  Your eyes will be making dirty love to each platter. Stupid pervert eyes with expensive taste.  Temptation at every corner.  You're in big trouble, mister. Temptation doesn't come cheap, but they deliver on the promise to make it worth it.  What can I say, this is possibly the most engaging, interesting, diversely tasty and most FUN dinner I've had all year.  Elevated dim-sum in a non-pretentious atmosphere with a personable staff getting down with some creatively delicious provisions that you can't get enough of.   I stay in the know in LA, but I can thank my chef lover for knowing about this new gem in SF that I had no clue about. We came to the walk-in line that was probably a good 20 deep by the time we got there. Our estimated wait time was about 3 hours from when they opened, so we meandered around town until then.   We were seated at the bars that surround the open kitchen and it made for interesting banter and fun sights.  Some of my favorite + most memorable provisions:  Tombo tuna-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker: YUM! And so pretty too.  For the love of KING TRITON, people, if this dish is till on the menu when you go, please note that the seaweed cracker \"plate\" is not a plate. It's part of the dish that is meant to be eaten. You are MISSING OUT if you don't eat this as intended. We saw people around us picking the tuna and leaving the seaweed..which was lightly fried and crispy..one of the most delicious elements.  Curried scallop &amp; avocado with crunchy quinoa: A delightfully fresh, textural treat.  Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth: I love how they pour the broth when you nod \"yes\" furiously upon seeing the tray holding these. This was delicious &amp; so flavorful and just right.  Balsamic roasted figs with fondue  Pork belly peach salad: I love how the peaches cut through the heaviness of the pork belly, making this dish feel surprisingly light.  Ricotta dumplings with spring onion &amp; sunflower seeds: I think this was the dish I was thinking of...the little yellow guys on a plate. Loved it.  I found the pancakes on the regular menu to be overly loaded with butter for my taste, especially at their petite proportions. But, you might like it.   Overall, I recommend coming here when you find yourself in SF. for a true San Francisco treat.",

    "review_text": "It took us weeks to get in - but mostly because we had to keep changing our dinner reservation for scheduling issues. \u00a0So, when we finally went on a Wednesday night - it was with some pent up expectations.  Happily, we were NOT disappointed.  When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the owner Stuart and his staff and were seated within just a couple of minutes. \u00a0The place is small, but hustling and with just the right amount of chatter (energetic but not so loud you have to shout to be heard).  We didn't order anything off the fixed menu (not deliberately), just because we were tempted by too many of the dim sum-style, tapas sized dishes that were being shuttled down the aisle by the wait staff.  Though all the dishes passed the good threshold - not all of them were standouts or dishes I would order again (as I will definitely be heading back). \u00a0  The top dishes were the almond biscuits with duck liver mousse (heavenly and so rich), the mouth-watering guinea hen dumplings in an incredibly aromatic broth (this was my favorite dish), the homemade potato chips and truffle aioli, and the \u00a0glazed pork ribs with spigarello &amp; togarashi - this last item we didn't actually order - as it's on the menu - but our server had a gut feeling we would like it, and did we! \u00a0The meat was super tender, juicy and the seasoning was delectable and reminiscent of cardamon.  The other dishes we had were the garlic puff bread and burrata (loved the cheese, but was not impressed with the bread), a scallop, salsa dish and a saute of mushrooms, eggplant, dahl &amp; cauliflower.  Oh, and before I forget - don't share dessert - we ordered the double chocolate pudding with pecan crunch and were fighting over the portion. \u00a0It was fabulous! Sweet, luscious and perfectly chocolate.  Go, sample and enjoy!",

    "review_text": "Ok seriously, how unique, creative, fun, amazing and awesome is this restaurant? I'd say it's worth the hype, especially when you spot Hilary Clinton eating in on the same night. \u00a0Pretty awesome.  So first thing's first- how to even get a seat without a reservation: wait in line before the restaurant opens to either get seated right away or get a reservation for a later time. This was our case on a Sunday night-- walked in 10 min before opening and there were about 20 ppl in line. We were not able to get seated right away but we got a 9:30 pm reservation. Whatever, we'll take it! They said if something opens up earlier, they'll call us. Never happened. I assume this restaurant never has cancelations. \u00a0Plan B- drink at a local bar, AKA social study around the corner.  Now that the logistics are out of the way, at least have 3-4 ppl to your party. I think that's the magic number. There are 2 ways to order food: \u00a0(1) holler at your waiter for certain items that are not offered by waiters walking around with trays and (2) get offered food by waiters walking around with trays.   Short version: if you like the ingredients, just order it. Everything here is good. Yes, everything.   They say the menu changes all the time so here's what we had:  ORDERED off the menu: - Anchovy toast- SO GOOD. Small size - Ahi tuna toast- also good. Small size - Fried pigeon- one of statebird's key dishes. Amazingly crisp and flavorful. - Ice cream sandwiches- came in 4 bite size portions, garnished with a thin slice of cheese (manchego?). Talk about mixing sweet and salty and making it totally work! Addicting and oh so good.  - Chocolate caramel pudding with some kind of crisp- again, very good - Warm apple cake with cream and fennel seeds(?). Smaller portion than the other desserts. Not as sweet, but also good.  BROUGHT TO US (AKA CART STYLE): - Oysters- nice little unique sauce; not your typical sherry vinegar or simple lemon - Fried bread with goat cheese- we got the last of a batch so it was a bit lukewarm but all the flavors were there. \u00a0I imagine a freshly fried one would have been better. - Chicken and shrimp ravioli in a dashi broth? Not creamy. Delicious. - Dry aged beef- could have done without this dish; it's kinda like beef jerky but the flavor and broth/ sauce accompanying it were great.  Think we got most of the circulating items except the beets and some other veggie concoction (go figure, I was with 2 boys!)  Great service, experience and food. No wonder all the hype!",

Luckily, my friend had extra seats to her mom's birthday party and I was able to go! The great part about this was no waiting and we had a set menu since it was such a large party. The bad part about this was not experiencing the dim sum dining, but I wasn't bummed.   The dishes were interesting and I enjoyed the different flavor components, though I wasn't blown away like I expected to be given that this is a Michelin star restaurant. The highlights for me were the chanterelle toast (though a bit oily); sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancake; 1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, farro, green olive salsa verde &amp; apple; CA state bird with provisions; red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum vinaigrette. Out of this list the pancake was my favorite! I was surprised by how crispy, yet creamy, yet savory this little gem was.   The service was excellent and overall I was very happily satisfied.

    "review_text": "Ok, State Bird doesn't need another five star review that talks about how innovative the food is, how nice the people, how electric the atmosphere yada yada. So I will focus on my experience as a single diner, not by choice, but with only one possible date and time to eat here during my current trip to SF.  I arrived at 430 and was about the 8th person in line. That's actually the perfect position because you are standing outside the kitchen window and can watch your food being prepped. The doors opened at 530 and only 15 or so folks had reservations, so many of us outside were seated right away.  I wanted to have a seat at the counter where I could watch the food being cooked, and that's what I got. There is less desirable counter seating right inside the door and beyond the waiter's station, so be sure to make a beeline for that kitchen seating for the best seat in the house.   I immediately made the mistake a solo diner must not make if you're going to try lots of things: I ordered two carbohydrate laden dishes, duck pate with little honey muffins (I'd seen it being prepped through the window and couldn't resist) and the \"must try\" garlic monkey bread with burrata. Poof, I was full, fifteen minutes in.  Of the other three dishes I ordered, the nori cracker with some kind of mollusk was a must-have as was the state bird (the small is a generous portion for one). And there were easily half a dozen items that sailed by which I desperately wanted to try. So I will be back, hopefully with a dining companion.  P.S. I am not shy about sharing food with strangers, but my seatmate was a guy who eats there twice a week and had very specific interests, so didn't work this time.",

Just about all of the off menu items were amazing: the guacamole with trout, pork belly, salmon tartar. The toasts were also very good.  What was not good: the state bird with provisions. In my opinion, their signature dish was the worst thing we had. I'd go so far as to say it was just bad. Luckily the other items made up for it.  The wine was also great; I liked their selection and we had a delicious bottle to compliment our food.  Besides the state bird, the other reason I cannot give this place, which holds such critical acclaim, 4 or 5 stars is because one of the waiters bringing around a tray had to be the worst salesperson of all time. His demeanor was bland at best and very unwelcoming.  For a restaurant in such high regard, it just fell short.",

The service was impeccable from threshold to farewell, the charming chef and his crew crafted a seamlessly delicious dim-sum style culinary experience. The genuine warmth and friendly expertise of the staff was impressive and heartfelt--for this alone I would return.   The menu is constantly shifting, but the staples we indulged in (The State Bird Provision--aka the crispy quail, the trout, the fried green tomatos, and the sweet corn pancakes) were flawless. For dessert, we had the most incredible caramelized coconut cake with a dark chocolate drizzle as well as a berry-infused peach rice pudding--both were some of the most wonderful sweets I've ever had the luxury to taste. This outing is well worth the several month reservation wait. State Bird doesn't miss a beat, and the unique opportunity to try so many exquisite plates in one sitting is a rare, exciting treat. Book it--giggling in elation with my friends over how many different amazing bites we tasted is a memory I won't soon forget.",

Eating and chatting with the chefs made this experience even more memorable. They were really fun and made it a really fun dinner experience.  The food you'll ask? Fantastic.

I liked everything, but can't stop thinking about the salmon mousse, the pork belly, and the burrata. The desserts were straight sexual (and I don't even like dessert). Further, I'd gone in expecting to hate the atmosphere. I thought I'd be surrounded by stodgy folks actively involved in taking their food too seriously, but I wasn't.

They sat us promptly and the restaurant was already packed. Theres a little counter to your right as you walk in which people can stand and eat.Seriously. And they do. We tried ordering a bunch of things but our waitress cautioned us saying that we were ordering a lot of food and there were going to be trays coming around with food not on the menu(She was right). So we ended up with all three of their savory pancakes (uni, sweet corn, and sourdough sauerkraut). The sweet corn had melted brie on the top and it made my toes curl.OHHHHHHHHH it was so good. Jovanie loved his uni pancakes as well. We tried some faro which was good. The state bird,which is fried quail, was very moist , and tasted good but I'm not a fan of fried things so it wasn't my favorite thing.However,if you like fried foods, then you will LOVE it. They don't have hard alcohol so we stuck with a drakes beer ,which is always good and then some kind of ale from a outfit called Pretty Things.It was good, but i'd stick with drakes if i had a chance to order a third round. We also got to try the garlic bread with burrata which everyone raves about but though it looks like heaven, i wasn't a big fan.I think mostly, because i was so looking forward to it.It was alright but as other Yelpers have pointed out,it is greazzzzzzy. The waitstaff has got to be one of the hardest working staffs i have ever seen in my life. They are not only waiting on their tables, but they are also wandering the room with trays of other food not on the menu and they describe to each and EVERY table. Now thats commitment. For dessert , we had the pudding and the plum ice cream sandwich. The pudding is not sweet. WARNING. You will expect sweetness when you see it on the menu.You will expect sweetness when you see it placed in front of you. You will expect sweetness when you put it in your mouth. NO SWEETNESS. The off menu items were heavy on the seafood side. This place is not for the faint of heart. They really elevate all the ingredients and challenge the diners with the combinations. Even though I'm not that adventurous when it comes to dining,I really enjoyed the experience and will go back. Thank you, SBP! PS When we left there were people lined up all along the wall like a gulag of human bodies waiting for a table to open up.Be prepared.",

The restaurant has a number of tables set aside for walk-ins. If you would like to experience this gastronomic piece of heaven and do not have a reservation, show up around 4:30 PM. My friend and I showed up at about 4:45PM on a Thursday afternoon and were the last of the walk ins to be immediately seated. The rest of the line were either given later times or denied entry for the night.   Now to the good stuff, the restaurant has a menu that is provided, but they also walk around with dishes (the same way dim sum is served). All plates can be shared, but if you're a glutton, feel free to order your own. We had a number of great dishes ( garlic bread with burrata, sourdough/ricotta pancake**, roasted squash pancake, spicy fried cauliflower**, red trout) (** = must haves)  We had a number of good dishes as well (guinea hen dumpling, fried green tomato, sweetwater oyster, potato and shrimp okonomiyaki, state bird). In addition, we had some okay dishes ( duck liver mousse, quinoa-cauliflower).  For dessert, we had a lemon curd granita which was okay, an olive oil ice-cream sandwich which was phenomenal and the world peace peanut muscovado which was amazing.   Every person that served us were pleasantly helpful. They explained each dish they brought out. Ryan and Janis in particular were amazing.   Great experience, loved it!  Will visit again !!",

I loved the whole concept, casual atmosphere and dim sum like carts rolling around with tasty treats, in addition to the larger items on the menu. \u00a0I really like being able to share and brought 3 girlfriends with me. \u00a0This is the kind of place where you benefit from coming with more people. \u00a0The more people you have at your table, the more items you can order and try. \u00a0Although since the portions are small, you sometimes have to order two of something, in our case that was the PORK BELLY. \u00a0It was so delicious I almost ordered it a third time as dessert, but I thought my friends would kill me.  Some items that stood out in addition to the yummy yet not so meaty state bird (quail), were the dumplings in brother, the aforementioned pork belly, the beef tartare, the hamachi avocado seaweed cracker, the oysters, the egg on top of the trout and that chocolate crisp dessert, did I mention THE PORK BELLY?   It is such a production to get in, and yes, the service is friendly and upbeat, and the food does not disappoint but it certainly doesn't make you want to necessarily make you want to run back.  I am just happy I was able to experience it once. \u00a0When the coast clears up a little, I'll try coming in again.",

    "review_text": "It is sooo hard to go to a place with so much hype, especially given how hard it is to get a reservation and waiting the two months for it to arrive! \u00a0The food here is good, yes. \u00a0There's really interesting combinations of ingredients that provide a really fulfilling eating experience (the key is eat slowly). \u00a0I love tapas style places because I like to try so many different things, but it is a little disruptive since people come by all the time with different plates of things, and it's sooo hard to hear every ingredient they list. \u00a0All the waiters are super nice though and are willing to repeat what items are, etc. \u00a0BUT like I said, everything is small plates, but they're priced like entrees! \u00a0So while the food is good, it is pricey and hard to justify the price, especially when some dishes are a little mediocre.  What was the STANDOUTS that I would go back for? - Tuna avocado and seaweed cracker: my friend said it tasted like a sushi roll, but it's so much better! \u00a0crunchy, little salty, creamy, fishy goodness - Smoked trout with crunchy quinoa tabouleh: soooo good, really great flavors and just a great combination of textures too - Smoked sturgeon cream dip with chips: I'm really not sure exactly what was in this, but it was pretty tasty, and I liked that the chips were a harder texture  Things that were SOLID: - Guinea hen dumpling: one dumpling with a lemony broth; good taste and texture; understated, but definitely better than usual dumplings. - Garlic bread with burrata: very light garlic, interesting bread texture (it's almost like a cinnamon bun, but not sweet and harder on the outsides; flakey, so there's gotta be butter!), and the burrata looks so creamy, but is so cheesy! - state bird: it's basically fried chicken, tiny pieces with lots of bone, but the lemony/cheesy onions on the bottom really make the dish complete and special - grapefruit curd poppy seed ice cream sandwich macarone with fennel: very light in texture and flavor; definitely an interesting, understated ice cream sandwich that's a little chewy; you can get a half of this one in case you want to try something else!  Things I would definitely SKIP: - Pork belly grape salad: way too salty/vinegary, but the grapes taste really good as a comparison. \u00a0They gave us fatty pieces and the pork is just really fried and hard - Rabbit and fontina croquette: rabbit was gamey; I just had a tiny bit of one - Chocolate roll cake, sesame mousse, seville orange-clove caramel: a dark chocolate taste; just very sweet and nothing too remarkable for me  Overall, a really good dining experience, but I don't know if it's the best food i've ever had. \u00a0I don't think I'd go out of my way to go here again, but I'd go back and try new things if I had the chance.  Tip for everybody trying to get reservations online, go online at 4 am!! \u00a0That's when cancellations go through.",

    "review_text": "uhhh over hyped, overrated however you want to put it. don't get me wrong, it's good but not THAT good. Probably a 3.5 but I'm going to leave this at a 3 for someone's attitude.  First, it took me damn near over a year to get a reservation. Can we also talk about the whole reservation system fiasco when they were switching over to opentable and tons of people had rezzies but then SBP emailed saying that they actually didn't? Yea that sucked and the way they handled it was pretty shitty (not even an apology, just \"Hope you dine with us in the future\" kinda spiel). I guess when you're the latest, hottest \u00a0restaurant in SF it doesn't matter how half-assed you handle a PR fiasco. Secondly, I expected this place to blow me away since it was so damn hard to get a rezzie. It was easier for me to get a table at freakin' French Laundry.   Anyway. One night I finally got lucky and scored a rezzie. I had been trying to get a table to surprise my bf for his birthday. One Sunday evening we hopped on the motorcycle and I told him what cross streets to go to. When we arrived at opening, there was a long line. SBP has no sign. Just look for a dark storefront and a long line of hungry people. He realized where we were his face lit up and he thanked me. Then he frowned at the line and asked \"wait.. we have a reservation right???\"  DUH!!!  I don't do lines. And for those of you waiting hours before they open, it's really not worth waiting that long for, seriously.   We were explained that we would be helped by various servers throughout the duration of our meal, food is carried around on trays or carts dim sum style and we pick what we want, and if we want something on the menu we have to place an order for it. Simple enough right?   We placed an order for iced tea and roasted bone marrow with one server. The iced tea never arrived and it had been a substantial amount of time that passed. When we inquired with another server, he said he would go check up on it. We told him we no longer wanted the iced tea but a beer instead. He went off and came back with a beer immediately. So the drink was totally forgotten which is ok, it happens I get it. BUT the table next to us had ordered roasted bone marrow AFTER us and gotten it BEFORE us.. I wondered if our order was even placed since the drink wasn't. Happened to get the attention of a female server and when I asked, she seemed annoyed, gave an exasperated sigh, \u00a0rolled her eyes and told me that roasted bone marrow takes awhile. I was trying to explain to her that I just wanted to double check because the server we placed the order with forgot our drinks so.. yeah. Nevermind Miss 'tude! I assume she was having a bad night. She turned around and BAM! our roasted bone marrow was brought to our table by another server. She turned back around and said \"here it is\" THANKS! Sooooo sorry to have bothered you because someone else mistakenly forgot part of our order!   We had a myriad of dishes \u00a0but the best dish that night was the pork belly in fish sauce vinaigrette.   SBP is good, but not GREAT. An attitude adjustment might be an improvement in a certain person, and it's best to dine here with one or two other people to experience a better range of their menu. Probably wouldn't do large groups because you'd have to do multiple orders of things and it can stack up on the bill. I really wanted to love it but I ain't drinkin' the Kool Aid sorry folks.",

Also, REALLY good were: eggplant frites, garlic bread with burrata, charred octopus, anchovy pancake, and quail egg  The items that were just OK in comparison to the rest were: spare ribs (too salty), duck (too plain; i prefer regular peking duck from chinese restaurants), and the chocolate pistachio torte (too dark/rich for my taste).

The reservation process for this restaurant is really lame, 60 days prior or getting up at like 4 am to check if someone cancelled. Where is the customer service for people who want to give you the business. One thing I noticed is that there is a lot secret hand shaking going on there, how is possible for you to know people by when no one can ever get in?!?how or why were people who came after us leaving before we were even called. Completely turned off by this place from the start.  I thought this was american food, but they should really say Asian flavors in the menu. I like the dim sum concept. I just was not impressed by the food, I wanted explosions of flavors not a bunch of seeds and herbs mixed with quinoa an fish or in a pancake or with more fish. I think we had 2 dished that were the best out of the night not that I've ever eaten. The seared trout and the trout with potato pancake.  I would of given it 2 stars but the chef there Dave was just amazing, he has amazing customer service and great cooking knowledge he earn the the 3rd star.

I ended up with 7 item (hey, it's like a tasting menu. \u00a0Just better)  The quail was really good, as was the cornish hen dumplings. \u00a0The farro risotto with farm egg was good, but maybe had one too many ingredients to wow. \u00a0They had local sardines (from the day's salmon catch), that was perfect over the potato salad. \u00a0The Salmon, corn and heirloom tomato salad, seemed simple but was really tasty!  I was going to forego dessert but was told that I really should try the cheesecake japonaise with sherry fis and honey. \u00a0At first I figured this was another \"you're trying too hard\" dish, but then I had a bite. \u00a0This was perfect. \u00a0The cheesecake was light. \u00a0The figs weren't too sweet and there was a sprinkling of black sesame seeds over it to give it a hint \u00a0of savoriness. \u00a0  I aslo got the world peace peanut milk. \u00a0Okay, it's $2 and it tastes like peanut butter + milk. \u00a0If that's your thing, you'll love it.

You can check out some awesome photos we took of the various dishes we ordered on our food website at the link below. The menu changes all the time, so these same dishes will probably not be available when you go, but it will give you a sense of what you're in for.   Enjoy!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featsporkjew.com%2Frestaurants%2Fstate-bird-provisions%2F&amp;s=094fe0e3896a1d81de2675e6e9444650b6c9aa4c93c983d1f2339cea40777c06\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">eatsporkjew.com/restaura\u2026</a>",

Maybe it was the sourdough pancake topped with sauerkraut. Perhaps the quail eggs with apple and sunchokes.  Then again it might have been the bone marrow topped with chanterelles and peppercorn. Or duck liver mousse with tiny almond biscuits. Might be the trout quinoa.  Perhaps they went straight for dessert and the shot of peanut milk while saving room for a cocoa nib ice cream sandwich and plum fudge.  In fact the only dish of the night that was remotely disappointing was the signature fried quail. Lots of skin but minimal meat. More room for everything else.  Even with a bottle of wine the damage was less than $60 per person. Such a small price to pay for the delicious creative brilliance demonstrated in almost every dish.  Enthusiasm of our server could not have been faked. Now see why she seemed so happy to work here. Space is alive and bursting with energy. And amazing food.  Allow me to add five stars to their well earned lengthy list of awards.",

    "review_text": "Ugh....  I've really been dreading writing a review of my experience at State Bird Provisions because of how long it will probably be. While I must admit this restaurant offers a fresh taste on Californian cuisine and prepares a lot of dishes well, there are a few things that fall short and don't live up to the legendary elite status this restaurant now owns.   I loved how the restaurant comes around in a \"dim sum\" style and offers food at table side. I further appreciate how the price of everything was listed alongside the dishes so I was always aware what my running total was. My partner and I ordered only a couple things off the \u00a0paper menu and then sampled everything off the carts.   Disappointments: burrata garlic bread; there was not enough garlic and the burrata was cold. Can we also talk about the state bird aka the take out from KFC with a few onions reluctantly tossed on the quails back? The eggnog ice cream sandwich; please discontinue this item as it tasted like freezer burn.  Things I loved: shiitake, persimmon &amp; quinoa 'tabouleh' , oysters with spicy kraut, the chips served with the tartare (the tartare itself was average at best) and corn muffins and liver mousse,   The wine pours are incredibly prudish but at least the waitstaff are polite and friendly. I'm excited I got to try State Bird and maybe I'll come back at some point but for now I'm all set.",

Got a walk-in table, which they told us would be late. They ended up getting our number wrong, so we called in at 9:45 and they gave us a table. Our waiter was very cool when he was at the table, but I've never been so rushed in a meal in my life. It was just uncomfortable. Staff literally was mopping around the table at 10:45. And there was an audible cheer as we walked out the door.  Net net: if you're going to play in the big leagues, act like it. If you didn't want to stay late, don't seat a customer late. That's all there is. But when you do seat a customer, you should at least pretend like you're excited to make more money. Because you're charging an arm and a leg for what's basically fried chicken and a few novel sides.  I'd be shocked if they got a Michelin star. That requires service and class. This is more like a hipster flash-in-the-pan type place.",

Started off with a Drake's pale ale, I love me a smooth, crisp ale, while waiting for our table, which was miraculously made a few weeks ago. Rumor has it there is at least a month or two wait for a table.  The most memorable dishes were the pork belly with kimchi - the pork was soft and chewy, altho the kimchi could have had a bit more spicy bite, the cheese burratta, which was like a crispy, cheesy pastry with a hint of rosemary flavor, and the nori chips with avocado and shrimp. Surprisingly, though the plate sizes were small (think of ban chan bowls served at Korean restaurants) after 5-6 dishes everyone was sufficiently full. To top it off, we ordered the strawberry granata with quince and tapioca (not the tapioca in milk tea kind). WOW! The granata had a iced gelatto texture and paired well with the tapioca and quince.  The bill was not bad either. I told Megan I will be back for the cheesecake though, I had to hold back!!",

The only dish that I could have gone without was the steak tartar. \u00a0The anchovy was a little too overpowering for me but it was still nice to have a few bites of salad with the meal.  I would definitely recommen only ordering a few dishes off the actual menu and waiting for the carts to come around. \u00a0The element of surprise about what we could possibly have next was really fun. \u00a0  For dessert the candied almond and chocolate ice cream sandwich was my favorite. \u00a0The meringue almost made it taste like a sophisticated s'more. \u00a0  And yes on our way out we did make our reservation for our next dinner there.",

I'm going to try to keep this story short, for my sake, because I really don't wish to relive this horrid occurrence any more than I have to.   I know that State Bird just opened about a month ago, so I'm really trying to avoid sounding overly harsh, given that the staff is new, blah blah. I can forgive things like slower seating or minor mistakes like that. But what happened was not minor. Our easy-peasy short two-item order was somehow lost between our table and the kitchen (distance of 30 feet, no joke) Really? REALLY??? I can hardly think of anything worse than completely omitting an entire table's orders.  So there we sat, the boy and I, 45 minutes later still waiting for our plates, being bullied (by our own hunger, not by SBP staff) into ordering dish after unsatisfying overpriced dish of their so-called \"dim-sum-inspired-a-la-carte fare\". What a crock. I hate to admit it, but it was this exact (seemingly) fresh idea of trollying around small plates that lured me in the first place.  I finally watched in astonishment at the chef sitting down to eat his own dinner, and noticing that most of the kitchen was shut down. Oh my Gee Ohh Dee. Asked our server how much longer our plates would be. She comes back and tells me nonchalantly \"Your ticket was never put in, oops.\" No apology, not comps, nothing. WOW.  To boot, I actually ordered the quail- the \"State Bird with Provisions\". Cue Alanis Morrissette's \"Ironic\", if you please. Tell me, how can a restaurant overlook a ticket for a homonymous order? If that's not dropping the ball, I really don't know what is.",

I don't remember) that came with (I think) a braised cabbage and prune. \u00a0It was a tasty combination.

    "review_text": "(See pics)  Review #1095.  Inventive items without a menu boundary. State Bird, as the owners used to hike along the peninsula and saw the quails walking around, was the name.  A tribute to California and bay area especially with lighter taste that pleases the local healthier crowds, a focus on using ingredients that we are all familiar with but with an interesting twist.  Interesting concept-- tapas serving in dim sum tray style as they walk around with freshly made food on scene. The space has a fusion of post 1906 earthquake brick exposed walls on 1 side, sound proof look-alike wall on the other. A very high ceiling and deep space for an eatery.  The utmost important dish with the battered fried quail which was very delicious, juicy and delightful. All other dishes we tried, such as duck rillettes, steak bites with a fried egg and vegetables, full on fresh and lightly grilled vegetables with goat cheese, properly cooked pasta with crab meat and peas, duck confit on baked slightly sweetened dough, dumplings, etc etc. All were good with lots of tones in them.  For the desserts, the very fine powdered peanuts with milk pouring over it was my favorite as it was very light in liquid but silky in taste. The chopped nuts and raisins in Ganache chocolate sauce, an unplanned put-together dessert in the owner's kitchen in the past, has become a hit and was lovely delicious.  Also a simple but good list of wines (for food and dessert), tea and BB coffee are a good balance for the varied plates.  On a strip that is filled with mostly Asian eateries, a couple bars and a few music venues, here flies the State Bird Provisions. Owner Stuart enthusiastically described his childhood hiking and seeing quails along the way was a nice touch to this new place. This will be a place where you will find different dishes at every visit.",

    "review_text": "I first heard about State Bird Provisions more than a year ago from a gay couple at the community table at NOPA. Since then, it had been on my list of places to eat at. Since it has been getting a lot of hype lately, especially with that James Beard award, I finally made an effort to check the place out. Reservations are usually booked 2 months out so if you want to eat here, you're going to have to come before opening (5:30PM) and get in line. This is the idea I had, so I arrived at 5:00PM to get in line hoping to get in the first seating of the first-come-first-served countertop. We were served hot cocoa in line--awesome. We, however, didn't make the first seating. It looks like you have to come at like 4:00PM to be a part of the first seating if you didn't want to be on a wait list. They do the thing where they take down your name, phone number, and give you an approximate time to return so you can go do other things while you wait. I always appreciate that. We were given 7:15PM so we went to a couple bars to kill time.  I had no expectations and just wanted a quality meal. It was explained to us that food comes out dim sum style and they mark the paper menu they give you for things you accept (just like at a dim sum restaurant). My first thought was that it was ingenious to apply dim sum style of eating to quality American food. I don't know any other American place that does it.  I wish I could remember everything I had (8-9 dishes). Everything was amazingly amazing. After a few dishes in, I decided that it was the best meal I've ever had in my entire life and it reminded me that truly good food can put you into a genuinely happier mood. You must absolutely get the friend quail and the egg nog ice cream sandwich.  Should you come here? No doubt--the whole concept and the quality of the food here will blow your mind. I am extremely happy that I was able to experience SBP and they very much deserve that Michelin star. The price point is very fair. My friend and I paid about $60 each for ~12 dishes and a few of drinks. The service is impeccable.  This is the place to be for quality food and a novel experience. This the shiniest gem in San Francisco, CA right now. I rarely give 5 stars, but this place commands 5+ stars.",

Food was generally good with one or two misses. Absolutely fell head-over-heel with don watson's lamb with cumin, squid, padrons &amp; grapes; the guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth had the Umami! factor. Definitely try the various 'pancakes' as no word could do them justice when you taste a bite of them. I tried the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancake and stone-ground whole grain fiscalini cheddar pancake, heirloom tomato &amp; roasted garlic. totally love the later  IMHO, the garlic butter wt fresh garden root vegetables was meh while the duck ham was nothing to Oh-Ah about. The much raved about garlic bread with burrata was a total let down. It was kind of oily &amp; chewy, maybe it's just my tastebud???  Food portion was spot on &amp; prices reasonable. It's American tapas, people! I won't suggest getting the desserts as none of them gave me the 'yumz' feeling ($8 each which is higher than most places-$6 for desserts)  Would I go again? Yes, but only if there's reservation. Don't think it is worth a 2-3 hours wait standing in-line. Trust me, I am a gal who will wait if it is worth it, like the 4 hours wait in Austin F1 concession stand just to get my cap :D",

Food: Extraordinary. \u00a0The reinvented tapas style menu with carts is refreshing, the conceptual design of food assembly was clever and fresh, and the integration between education and social interaction was great. \u00a0The poached egg paired with smoked bonito flakes and beans was a fabulous play on textures and flavors: the mild soft egg integrated perfectly with the smokey bonito flakes, the crunchy cheese topping and the hearty texture of the beans. \u00a0The house made chips with creme fraiche and caviar was playful. \u00a0CA State Bird Provisions is a must have, as the delicate breading was fried to perfection and the texture of the bird itself is plump and juicy in a bed of sauerkraut. \u00a0And the trout was a knockout too: the kishus and hazelnut danced in my mouth with the smooth brown butter, but it did not overshadow the fresh taste of the trout. \u00a0We ordered a total of 8 tapas, but I am not listing everything because I will end up writing a novel.  Service: \u00a0 Top notch. \u00a0Sarah, our server, was on point at all times, and the nuances and attention to detail she had was amazing. \u00a0When she noticed we didn't have any plates of food on our table toward the end of the meal (we were waiting for more carts to come out), she expedited a few custom items for us. \u00a0Water in bottles were refilled without asking, she was consistently checking on our table without being overbearing, she was knowledgeable about the food preparation and ingredients in all items served that evening, \u00a0Candice was another food runner that noticed that she has come around twice to us with the raw bar and asked us was there anything else I haven't tried yet that she can grab for us. \u00a0Finally, a cute curly hair brunette with a neck scarf (don't know her name) who was also a runner remembered that I declined a dish that was with raw seafood (I'm allergic) and came back to me on several occasions with other non-raw fish items for me to try. \u00a0  In conclusion, for all adventurous foodies out there, this is the place to be. \u00a0You will be blown away by the experience in more ways than ten, I guarantee it!",

    "review_text": "There are many beautiful restaurants offering friendly, attentive service and serving creative, delicious food in San Francisco. State Bird Provisions is one such restaurant, but it offers one additional thing that sets it apart from its peers and places it in a unique, far more elite class of dining establishments: It is a restaurant that captures the true heart and soul of its city. To step into State Bird Provisions is to enter a microcosm of the spiritual fabric of San Francisco. Allow me to explain:  1) The Californian-Asian cuisine It is no secret that San Francisco has a rich and lively Asian community that spans multiple countries, nationalities and ethnicities. It is also no secret that the city has access to fresh produce year-round. State Bird Provisions reflects both of these aspects in its cuisine. Whether it is a \"stew\" of purple radish leaves mixed with poached egg and fish, or a salmon tartare combined with pumpkin seeds and quinoa, or stir-fried vegetables with almonds, crunchy rice, cheese and romesco sauce, the menu each day is a harmonious marriage of Asian-Western ingredients, culinary techniques and cooking styles, combined with the delicious, endlessly fresh bounty of the earth that characterizes the Golden State.  2) The dim sum-style service It should come as no surprise, following #1, that State Bird Provisions also offers a uniquely Asian style of serving food. Most dishes are tapas-sized, good for 2-4 people and presented by carts and trays by various serving staff. Simply choose which dish(es) you want and your order(s) is marked on a checklist--just like at dim sum restaurants.  3) The bustling, open kitchen I'm probably biased because this is where my friend and I were, but I would argue that the best place to be in the restaurant is at the standing \"chef's table\" at the front of the restaurant. Place your things on the hooks provided and stand back (literally) to enjoy the sight of State Bird Provisions' many line cooks carefully and meticulously preparing their dishes. San Franciscans love good food, but San Franciscans also embrace an open, casual, laid back attitude. This is reflected in the kitchen, where the cooks are a friendly, easy-going bunch dressed in whatever clothes are most comfortable for them (no matching suits and ties here) and chatting easily with diners while they slice, toss, saut\u00e9, roast and plate.   When I left State Bird Provisions, I felt as if I had just spent the last 2 hours consuming the very essence of what makes San Francisco great. For that reason alone, a visit to this restaurant should be on everyone's to-do list.",

    "review_text": "While there are many Michelin star restaurants to try in SF, Statebird is one of them. I guarantee this will probably be your cheapest Michelin experience too!   I stayed up until 12am to get an open spot 60 days from the time of reserving. Luckily, I got a 5:30pm spot open and all I had to do was wait two months..  Well that time finally came and we were ready to grub on every single dish! (well, maybe not all..) My boyfriend was stuck in traffic 40 minutes late and the servers were kind to still seat me despite not having my other guest there. Thank goodnesssss.  We ordered the following: 1. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits 2. Guinea hen dumpling with shiitake mushroom 3. Garlic bread with burrata cheese - Cheese was subtle and bread was soft. Melted with the cheese. 4. Seawater Oysters 5. Potato Chips with ahi TUNA - AMAZING! 6. Lamb Chinese sausage 7. Hamachi trout - TO DIE FOR!!!!!  8. Pork belly with viet vinaigrette - overcooked and a bit dry 9. Crispy snacking pork 10. CA statebird with provision - tasted like fried chicken. Skin was crispy.  11. Shrimp salad topped with okonomiyaki 12. Duck fried rice - NOMMMM  I highly recommend everything with the exception of the pork belly because it was a little dry. All in all, it was a fabulous experience. Servers were very punny. One offered us \"Beets By Dre\", which were actual Beets. Hahah",

    "review_text": "After my first visit to state bird provisions, I was floored by the various creative and delicious dishes that were offered \"American dim sum\"/tapas/shared plate style.  After the second visit, it was still just as good. And the service was also good, Ryan, the manager, was charismatic and very welcoming it made our dining experience even better.  My recommendation for first timers is say YES to everything (if you don't have dietary restrictions or there's only 2 not so hungry people in your party). But just try it! You'll be amazed and really get a feel of the place if you open your mind and palette and just enjoy the different shared plates!  It lived up to the hype and is truly deserving of their michelin star rating.  Tips for reservations: reserve early (in the early 12-5am is best to go online)--up to 60days in advance, they do have walk-ins but it's either a looong wait or slim chance of getting in, you have to be really lucky!",

    "review_text": "3.5 stars out of 5.  Came here on a Tuesday around 6:15 and they said that we would have a table at around 8. We headed to 1300 Fillmore for happy hour drinks (they would text us when a table was available).  There's a menu with direct orders from the kitchen as well as items not on the menu that they walk around with to lure you in (prices displayed).  Here's a list of what we ordered with ratings:  2/5 - Farm egg with bacon, chanterelles, and tomato sauce - Tomato sauce reminded us of pizza sauce. Bacon was flavorful but the overall dish didn't come together well.  2/5 - Kimchi tofu pork belly stew - had better kimchi stew homemade. Kimchi was a little too sour for us.  4/5 - Fried quail - batter was flavorful and quail was juicy.  3.5/5 - Ribs - good but nothing to write home about. Fall off the bone tender.  4/5 - Guinea hen dumplings - meat was nice and spiced and the broth was a great compliment.  3/5 - Seafood ceviche - Pretty bland. Could have been more citrusy or with some accompanying herbs. A little like bland tomato pur\u00e9e.  5/5 - Fig and Lavender ice cream sandwich. Delish! So many flavors going on in every bite. It was like a party in my mouth. My friend mentioned how the lavender notes hit different parts of your taste buds (I usually don't like lavender). The favors were harmonious and really stimulated my palette (sounds cheesy but that's how I really felt). We were glad we got this one because otherwise we would have been disappointed.  Overall, such a hyped up restaurant should have every item on the menu special (at least good and not mediocre) and I didn't feel that way. I would suggest waiting for hype to die down or make reservations if you really want to try it. Also everything is pricey and the items that pass by are tempting so if you care about how much you spend I would suggest doing some research on what dishes are good since I felt like it was a waste for some of the choices we tried. Maybe if we lucked out on trying every dish that was good I would give it a 4.",

It has been on my list of places to try and last week I finally got the opportunity.  Reservations a hard to come by. However if you line up before they open you can snag a table. The reserve the counter area for walk ins. It's actually quite nice to sit in this area. It's not as private as an actual table, but I actually enjoyed it because you get to watch the chefs as they prepare each dish.  The food is delicious. It's kinda of like dim sum style. The chefs prepare various dishes and take them by each table on trays. You just grab what you want and the mark it down on your sheet. Everything we tried was delicious! However my favorites were there Hamachi Nori Cracker (AMAZING!) and the Poppyseed Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich. Both are must haves!  Definitely worth it the wait. If you can score reservations that's better, but if not try to line up before they open. I think they open at 6PM, so I'd try to be there by 5:30 to get your name on the list. We ended up with seats by 7:30, but it's worth it. Just put your name down and grab drinks at Fat Angel around the corner!",

My favorites were the Kimchi with tofu skin and the crusted pork tenderloin. Other table faves were the dumplings and the pork belly. The only one that we did not finish was the mushrooms.   Second, the customer service was beyond amazing. Every server was busy but each time we stopped one to ask for something, they were super friendly and accommodating. Also, every one of them knew the gf items very well and were very spot-on with recommendations. Given the style of dim-sum-type service, we wondered how it would go but it was phenomenal.

    "review_text": "I really wanted to like this place, but I was pretty underwhelmed.  First off, the format is cool in theory - small plates come around a la your typical dim sum restaurant. i get it, you're trying your best at shifting some paradigms. that's fine. However, one big difference is that when the dim sum steam cart comes around, the food that is presented to you is actually hot because, well, it's coming out of a steam cart. At SBP, the \"hot\" dishes that come out are often times just room temperature, because they've been hanging out for a little bit before they get to your table. Sure there are dishes that don't need to be hot so those make it to your table at the temperature you'd expect.   I can get over the dining experience issues, but the food is where this place fell flat. With a few exceptions everything was pretty lackluster. Of all the dishes we had, the standouts were a fluke sashimi with blood orange vinaigrette and a dessert consisting of creamy polenta with huckleberries. Both were superbly executed.  beyond that, the flavor profile of many of the dishes seemed, in the words of my wife, \"rounded.\" I'd describe them as muddled, unfocused, and even downright bland at times (pseudo-casear salad - i'm looking at you). I know it isn't fine dining, but i expected a lot more from the kitchen, given the hype. For the record, duck pate does not work well with cornbread. Bone marrow in dressing on a beef cheek salad comes across as a ham-fisted. The texture of a hazelnut does not add the right kind of flair to a mushroom salad. Many of the kitchen's decisions just seemed clunky. A for effort but C for execution.  And If i'm paying $20 for FOUR pork ribs, i expect them to be the best ribs i've ever had. Sure, they were falling off the bone, but to me, they were rather dry and poorly seasoned. I'll head down to Texas and get a bucket of them for that price and be a much happier customer.   To their credit, the staff was awesome, service was great, as was the booze selection.   i know i fall in the small minority on my assessment of SBP. I can accept that. Maybe I just hit it on an off night. However, with all the other tasty options available in this city, i don't think State Bird Provisions will be getting another chance to send me home with $100 less in my pocket.",

We ordered without abandon, had 1-2 beers each, and ended up with a $50 bill + tip (so about $60).   Favorites - Lobster salad with lentils - Garlic break with burratta - Ricotta dumplings - State Bird w Provision - crispy deliciousness - Ice cream sandwich  We also had the oysters (yum), uni flatbread (i've had better ways to have uni but interesting), ribs (fatty and delicious), bacon wrapped fish belly (fatty and delicious), and the white chocolate mochi rice pudding (yumm).  Highly recommend getting two orders of the ice cream sandwich. They cut them up to four pieces, but it is SO worth getting two pieces each with the delicious citrus dollop and the marshmellow with the roasted crust (guessing torched). Gingery cookie. So good.",

The food that we ordered off the menu was delicious (the trout and the smoked duck pancakes - wow!) and came quickly. The ice cream dessert was out of this world, and was again my favorite dessert.   But my favorite dish remains the deconstructed seaweed cracker (formerly the nori seaweed cracker). We ordered a large ($22) amongst the three of us and I was in heaven with every single bite.

For the price, I thought it was quite good. \u00a0And if it was easier to get in, I'd definitely go back. \u00a0The prices are reasonable, but yes, they are tapa sized items. \u00a0If we hadn't ordered wine, it would have only been $40-50 per person. \u00a0For that level of food, that is about what I'd expect for a good value. \u00a0I WAS expecting more \"wow factor\" given the press and rep--only 1-2 dishes really did that for me--but the service was excellent/friendly and approachable. \u00a0  The citrus, avocado chili lime tapa was excellent. \u00a0Refreshing, but not so beguiling that I couldn't duplicate it at home (or so I think!). \u00a0I much appreciated the supremed citrus though. \u00a0The state bird was also pretty good (fried quail--just like you expect it to taste).  Ribs were solid but not anything exceptional--dark green accompanying the ribs were also not so remarkable to us. \u00a0I personally thought the uni pancake was nicer (a bit more fluffy, and many flavors/textures) than the the saurkraut pancakes with salt. \u00a0But my other dinner guests would say the opposite \u00a0We also had two seafood tapas which were unremarkable and two desserts which were ok. \u00a0Despite the fact that we all thought the desserts were just ok, it was all gone somehow before we left.  We were lucky to get a reservation for the same day we called (due to a cancellation). \u00a0If it were easier to get in (not such a labor) I would definitely come back because I thought the price for the level of what you get and what they're trying is great. \u00a0I don't think (personally) it's a michelin star level (does not delight and beguile). \u00a0But it's very smartly run, the kitchen has great intent, servers go out of their way for you, dim sum concept is fresh, and I hope they continue to be a great success. \u00a0  When we go again, one thing we'll do differently is skip the $80 bottle of oregon pinot noir. \u00a0 The wine was nice on its own, but once the food came... Let's just say that a lot of their dishes have enough fatty mouthfeel that any half decent glass of wine would go great. \u00a0Next time we'll just order a few individual glasses to have more fun sampling different wines. \u00a0That's probably a better philosophy given the variety of dishes State Bird offers.",

I was taking my visiting from out of state friends and they were all excited. We arrived on time. Once arrived, they told us we did not have a real reservation and that we would have to wait until someone left. I've never had anyone ever tell me this, and had I known we would be treated this way, I might have chosen another option. I don't know if it was a chaotic night or miscommunication but after nearly an hour of waiting we were seated with no apologies or remorse.

    "review_text": "To celebrate a semester well done, my teammates and I decided that we were going to splurge and spend an evening at State Bird Provisions. We emailed the restaurant in September asking for a reservation for 5 people in December, so you can see what kind of planning goes into securing a spot for a large-ish group.   We arrived for our reservation and were seated immediately. Waiting for us on our table was our fixed menu for the evening. I asked our server if we could order other items off the menu because I really love their peking duck and I saw that it wasn't one of the fixed items. She said it was possible, but cautioned us to wait and see how \u00a0much food was coming, which I really appreciated later when we were stuffed to the gills and could barely walk out on our own two feet.  We started our celebration off with a delicious bottle of Prosecco. As each item of food was delivered to our table the servers gave a description. We were happy to find that each of the dishes had enough food for each person to have one serving. The restaurant has its portioning down to a science!  We brought two bottles of wine with us, but I regret that we didn't really think very closely on the type wine we should have brought. The food at State Bird is very light and delicate. I would recommend bringing a really delicious pinot noir. We brought an oaky cab and zin and neither was a great match for the food.  The best part about coming and having a prefixed menu was that we didn't have to make any decisions all night. We spent our time talking and laughing and enjoying the food that we were experiencing together. Our reservation clearly stated that we would only have the table for two hours, but we were having so much fun the time flew by and before we knew it we have been there for 2.5 hours! The staff was super friendly the whole time and never mentioned that we needed to leave or made us feel rushed.   Here is our menu with some short notes about each item...  FIRST COURSE - raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi krant &amp; sesame (delicious and fresh) - hamachi-avocado &amp; seaweed cracker (super tasty and left us wanting more) - smoked trout 'creamed' beets (so good we were literally licking the serving dish clean) - duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (I don't usually like duck liver mousse, but this was excellent!) - sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino &amp; ricotta pancakes (yum! especially with the dipping salt) rabbit &amp; fontina croquettes (very savory and tasty)  SECOND COURSE - garlic bread with burrata (delicious and the bread is very fluffy) - shiitake, persimmon &amp; quinoa 'tabouleh' (we loved all the different textures in this one!) - pork belly grape salad (I thought that the sauce was a bit heavy on the fish sauce) - spicy fried cauliflower salad, bayley hazen blue cheese &amp; fermented green tomatoes (super tasty and flavorful!) - 1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, apple, sunchokes &amp; mt. tam (I thought that this one was a little bland for me)  THIRD COURSE - CA state bird with provisions (perfectly crispy and tasty) - wild mushroom farro spezzato (it was good, but didn't stand out) - red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum brown butter (good, but not as good as other dishes) - spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (very flavorful and tasty)  DESSERT - 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk (tasted like drinking a snickers in a good way) - eggnog icecream sandwich, almond macaroon (so delicious!!) - bittersweet chocolate ganache tart, brown sugar-oat crust, olive oil (great if you love chocolate)",

The oxtail, Bone Bread (pretzel-roll) with marrow sauce, and the beet salad are my favorite, and most of the rest of the things we tried (and I think we tried everything except the sardines on toast - we were full, not uninterested) was solidly good and interesting. A few dishes were pedestrian in design, although executed well, and only one seemed to be showing off its outr\u00e9 ingredients.  Deserts were similarly inventive and rather good, especially the fig arugula.  We were there on the second night of operation, and we hope it does well.

And these provisions are good! I actually stood at the kitchen counter, which is an excellent way to enjoy your meal, so long as there isn't a long line of folks standing right behind you. At the counter, you get time to watch your chefs make your food, admire their craft and craftiness, and even get to throw in a word or two in between plates running in and out of the broiler. It's a real experience and not just a meal; a sort of Disneyland for the culinary senses.   When it came down to food, I had the crudite with goat cheese and toasted sesame that was quite fresh and refreshing, although not particularly accented one way or another. This I followed with the duck rillette with almond biscuit. Now, this is where you need to pause for a moment. Reading this dish's description you might find yourself very underwhelmed. I mean, what's the big deal about duck rillette and almond in particular? It's not like ducks and almonds grow on the same tree or feed from the same terroir after all. Well, think again. This combination of rillettes with a financier like \"biscuit\" is absolute genus. Whether accredited to Stuart (the chef) or not, I give him full credit for making them and making them oh so well. This is quite possibly the best preparation of duck rilletes that I've ever had. The secret, I'm told, is in the use of duck fat instead of butter to plump up those financier biscuits. And, it tells. These things are so rich and so perfectly matched to enliven the otherwise lean rillettes. The one-two flavor punch is just to die for. I applauded them -- with my hands, as did another patron as she was leaving for the night. Truly, there were accomplishments worth an ovation at this place.  This stellar dish was followed by two dishes which did not particularly overwhelm my culinary sensibilities. They were good, but somehow they did not move the needle for me far above just nice. These were the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus, which are a kind of gyoza/pierogi inside a small soup made of sauerkraut juice, and the cauliflower, lentils and sunchokes, which was a curried dish that seemed to neither scream lentils, nor cauliflower, nor sunchokes and yet still managed to stay mildly nice. But no worries, this was just a short plateau in what picked up again into a nice crescendo: the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancakes and the green garlic bread with burrata. Ok, the pancakes I am just partial too. They're fried cheese pancakes. What can possibly go wrong with that? Nothing. And although I don't recall a strong taste of sauerness, I did like the seasoning quite a lot and especially the ground coriander that appeared all over the plate (idiot alert: i may be wrong about it being coriander, but that's how I remember it now). This dish was fine enough on its own, but then I saw one of the chefs roll out a fresh roll of green garlic bread, where the green and the garlic are mixed into the fresh dough which is then -- gasp -- deep fried. Oh boy, now I was getting short breathed with excitement. Fried dough with fried cheese?! oh, dear lord. And, the lord did provide. What a wonderfully fun dish. Served freshly fried, the burrata cheese is nestled inside of its bread roll like a puppy in its crib, and you \"just wanted to eat it,\" as my sister is ought to say of puppies in cribs. And eat it I did. Nomnomnom good.  But that wasn't all. Oh, no. To top off my savory dish extravaganza, I took the half CA state bird: a deep fried quail with pepitas on top of a lemon-onion concoction that all put together is like a mad twist on chicken piccata meets the deep fryer minus the waffle. Deep brown in color and tender and juicy this dish was just pure success, and I am honored to have shared in it. What a great recommendation from the chef, who had been guiding my selection throughout the night. Another great perk of standing at the counter and not being a lazy bum at a table (I'm venting a bit for not having wanted to wait 30 mins for a table to open; it's acceptable. Look it up in the Yelp rule book). And so, my meal ended, but not the fun. Dessert. It has to come. I mean, it has to, right?  And come it did. Twice. A truly multi-orgasmic finish to an already stimulating meal is what I got when I ordered the \"world peace\" peanut muscavado milk and the warm cornmeal custard, walnuts and huckleberries desserts. Yelp is limiting how much I can write about it, so you'll have to go try these on your own. And, if I was living in San Francisco, I'd be telling all my friends about this place, because without doubt the bird is the word.   Word.",

They serve the food in a \"dim sum style\" as they will walk around with a cart or plate of tapas and you can choose which one you would like to take. But, I found it easier to order from the menu as I was ordering from the walking plates at the same time. It was hard to tell when the next cart/plate will come around.   My favorite dishes are the avocado and shirp with nori chip and buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato'. A waiter told me that the Garlic Bread with Buratta is their most popular dish but it was a little too \"cheesy\" and too heavy for me. Also, I wasn't too fond of the dumplings, they were bland and stiff.  Another tip for ordering food: do not order anything with the host. We could not locate our waitress for a while so we asked the hostess if she could find our waitress for us. The host took our order and ended up chatting with the gentlemen sat behind us for half an hour and our waitress never received our order.  Overall, I love their decor and atmosphere. Service was great, and I enjoyed most of the dishes we got!",

    "review_text": "I fought long and hard with the rest of the Bay Area's diners to secure a reservation at State Bird, a task that became immeasurably more difficult after Bon Appetit and countless other magazines, blogs, and newspapers dubbed it the hottest thing in SF aside from the ban on public nudity. Finally, though, I got a reservation, albeit at a super early (5:30) time.  No other restaurant has been this hyped in the Bay since maybe Mission Chinese, but I can say that it mostly met my expectations. The food, concept, service, and decor all range from good to excellent, but there were still a few moments that just barely kept this from being a 5 star restaurant for me.  Here's the rundown:  - Sweet corn pancakes with garlic chives and Mt. Tam triple cream cheese: this was the first thing we tasted, and it was one of the most spectacular dishes of the night. It was so good, in fact, it set an impossible standard for the rest of the dishes that followed. But the sweetness of that corn, the light touch of the cheese...oh my. - Quail: I had to try the namesake dish of the restaurant. I think this was battered with panko, and there was a nice citrus sauce that went with it (yuzu, I'm pretty sure) - cooked really well. I love quail (it's one of my favorite things to eat when done correctly) and this was spot-on. - Cauliflower viennoise, beets, horseradish-ale cream: Easily the single best dish of the night, aside from the corn pancakes. My wife is the pickiest eater on the planet and she loved this dish. The complexity of flavors on display here was impressive, with the earthy cauliflower, sweet beets, acidic and creamy horseradish, bitter arugula. Well done. - Farro with pickled vegetables, topped with a mixture of seeds and nuts and a yogurt sauce: also really good, and a very complex flavor profile. I love pickled anything (comes from the Korean and Polish heritage), so this dish was a winner for me.  - Pork belly, kimchi, tofu: Because State Bird's dim-sum style approach to smaller plates, it's hard to get everything you want - this dish kept running out before it got to us, so we had to ask our server for one. It didn't disappoint, though the belly was a bit too dry on some pieces and the dish could've used more kimchi liquid. I'm sure this was inspired by the buta kimuchee dishes you find at izakayas and was a good representation of that dish. - Oyster with kohlrabi and chili: Not as great as I wanted it to be, though the contrast in texture between the kohlrabi and the oyster flesh was fun. - Huckleberry beets with yogurt: A great dish - almost could've been a dessert. - Pork pate with rosemary chips: The pate was really, really good and flavorful, though the chips were too flaky to support the thick pate. - Burrata on garlic fry bread: one of those dishes that's awesome for the first few bites and gets less appealing as it sits. The fry bread got too hard after a few minutes, but the burrata was sublime. - Guinea hen dumpling: I loves me some guinea hen, but the flavor of it was a bit lost due to the intensity of the mushroom and yuzu broth. Skin was a bit too thick for my tastes, too. - Tuna crudo with quinoa: A fun dish - like the oyster dish, there was a texture balance here that was really fun, and the sauce was great, too.  The biggest letdown for us was the dessert, which was the cheesecake japonaise with huckleberries. I must confess my palate was letting me down in this case. My wife is Japanese and we normally love Japanese style cheesecakes, but there was something off about this one - I tasted curry powder, though I'm sure that wasn't in there. The texture also just didn't agree with us - it was too dense compared to how fluffy and light Japanese style cheesecake usually tastes. The other dessert choices looked really good, and we regret not choosing something else.",

    "review_text": "This was flat-out one of my best dining experiences!!  I knew going in that getting a seating would be a challenge. I decided with a friend to go in on a Monday as close to opening time as possible. They open at 5:30 pm and I heard that people sometimes line up at 4:30 pm. Well, we both had work on Monday, so we got there at 5:55pm (I remember because we had to put in 5 minutes worth of coins at the meter). There was a line to put your name on the list. When we got to the front about 10 minutes later, the dude was super nice and let us know that unfortunately all the seats were taken for the night. Wow!! But, they had standing room available at 8:45pm. Cancellations could potentially change things, but otherwise the only option was to have us stand at the counter right by the door. It didn't seem ideal, but we agreed. They took our # and would call us when ready. The whole experience would normally have been frustrating anywhere else, but here the dude was so polite and nice, that we were impressed. We ended up going to Fat Angel for a drink and then Pride of the Mediterranean for Hookah and had an awesome evening waiting for our table.    Okay...so now to the actual dining experience. We were hoping to get bar seating, but ended up at the standing are as originally planned. Turns out that this is the best \"seat\" in the house. Yes, we were right by the door, but we were facing the kitchen and right by the action. Every chef came over and talked to us while doing their thing throughout the night. Everyone was so friendly. They were absolutely slammed with a packed house, but they always took time to talk with us. No one was rushing around, the service never felt hurried, people joked with us when bringing around the food...it was great. The best part was that everyone in the kitchen was having fun! The standing area almost made you feel like you were part of that fun...and that makes the overall experience so ridiculously awesome.   Now, the food...  Have you ever read one of those \"Choose your own adventure\" books? You flip to a certain page if you want the character to do this or that. Keep that in mind. Now think about a fancy sit down tasting menu with carefully composed dishes at a place like Coi, Ame, Michael Minna, etc. \u00a0Now...combine the two, and you have SBP. Yes...that's right...AMAZING. Seriously...each dish could hold it's own against individual tasting menu dishes at a fancy Michelin rated restaurant. But the advantage to SBP is that you can choose your own dining adventure. You can pick whatever suits your mood. From Artichoke Bread Salad to Curried Scallops to Pork Belly to Garlic Bread &amp; Burratta, each dish is unique and composed with various tastes to culinary perfection. It's a completely out of this world experience in the perfect dining environment. Desserts are just as phenomenal. I'm not going to describe each dish...you should just go there and try them out. They have something like 16 dishes that get passed around, plus over 10 more that are listed on the menu that you can order. There are several vegetarian dishes...in fact more than half our dishes were veggie, and they were delicious!  I know there are some low Yelp Ratings in other reviews...that's fine. But trust me...make the effort to get a seat...or better yet...STAND. Try it yourself, and make your own decision. Good thing is that you don't have much to lose. If you don't like the food, you can leave after the first dish. But I'm pretty sure you're going to keep ordering more and have a ridiculously amazing dining experience similar to ours.   SBP - you guys rock. From the very first taste of the first dish, through the 13 other dishes, all the way down to the last drop of the peanut butter milk shot, we absolutely loved every bit of it. Adding to that was the amazing fun attitude of every person in the kitchen, the wait staff...everyone. Make the entire experience over the top. Thanks, and we'll be back very very soon!",

The visual feast would've satisfied me. Well, not really, but seriously tastespotting worthy.

I tried things I've never had before, sweetbreads and guinea hen, and they were fantastic!  Food aside, the service was outstanding. Even though our group had a reservation at 8pm, they were running behind and sat us at 8:30. No prob, we went across the street to the boba place and waited, and any other restaurant would've apologized and left it at that, but here, they comped us each a glass of champagne! And then our server was the nicest and friendliest with the best sense of humor! The entire staff was very attentive.  Really great first experience.

    "review_text": "\"Some people deserve to have their faith rewarded.\"  I was a bit nervous going into State Bird Provisions for a friend's birthday. I knew it would be a long wait, if we got in at all. The recent Michelin star gave this place a certain amount of cache with the foodie crowd in town, and they had come out in droves. I showed up at 6:15pm on Tuesday to put my name in, and we were told they had an opening at 8:30pm. Given the fact that their reservation list was packed for over a month when I inquired, that was better news than I expected. We grabbed wine at Dosa before eventually getting in.   SBP is split into two zones, tables for the larger groups, and counter seating for the pairs. We had the counter, right at the entrance to the kitchen. From the counter, you can drool all over everything being made, but we had one distinct advantage. Every dish that was brought out was presented to us first. Yes, this made our bill skyrocket, but it was all so amazingly good. We had the state bird (quail), pork belly, the ahi/wasabi, oysters, and a whole a lot more. Between that and their excellent wine selections, we rolled ourselves out stuffed after a great evenings.  Two shout-outs to the team. 1) Katherine from their reservations desk was incredibly responsive, even though I'm sure she's being deluged with last-minute requests from jerks like me to get a table. I'm sure her job involves having to say 'no' a lot, but she was great about encouraging me to come down on a weeknight and try my luck. 2) Melody was hosting that evening, which meant running defense from the 'Do you know who I am?' crowd that kept trying to muscle their way in, and she handled herself with far more grace than I would have. No matter how frantic the greeting area was, she was a constant ball of sunshine.  We had an excellent evening at State Bird Provisions, and I hope you do too!",

Review from a vegetarian dining at this restaurant: - The hearts of palm, avocado, and nectarine salad was a party of flavors in a single bowl. There was crunchy, creamy, sweet, salty, and tangy, and yet it all worked beautifully together. Definitely my favorite dish of the evening. - The sweet corn and tomato salad was simple, light, and refreshing. Loved by both carnivores and herbivores alike. - If you're looking for something a little heavier, the corn pancakes are a good option. I thought they were tasty, but not spectacular. - The garlic bread + burrata is a must-have here. It's a tad salty, so you need a good glass of water with it, but the creamy burrata complements the crunchy garlic bread very well. - DESSERTS! Definitely save room for these. Those ice cream sandwiches are so perfect for the end of the meal, and we also got to try their new menu item which was a butter cake with tomatoes and peaches. Very unique flavors. Worth a taste.  Note for the non-vegetarians: Although I didn't try it, it was generally agreed upon at my table that the pork belly and plum salad was amazing.",

    "review_text": "4.5 stars  This was one of the restaurants I really wanted to try while I was in San Francisco (probably #1 on my list). Not surprisingly, reservations are still very difficult to come by, probably one of the most difficult in the city. I checked their website multiple times per day for a couple of weeks, and the best I could do was a party of 2 at 5:30 (looking for any availability over a week span). The day before, some cancellations yielded a 10:30 table for 4; very late, but it allowed our whole family to dine together.  duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - The rich mousse was pretty tasty on its own, but the warm biscuits (scented with almond) were a great pairing.  porcini dip with rosemary buttermilk cracker - Another spreadable dish, it showcased clean porcini-cheesy flavor with crispy rosemary crackers. This was pretty nice too.  garlic bread with burrata - If I saw this on the menu, I probably wouldn't have ordered it (it sounded kind of plain). But seeing this come out of the kitchen, it was clear that my assumption was wrong. The hot, fried bread was light and airy and just oozing burrata and olive oil. The garlic flavor was fairly subtle but present.  fuyu persimmon with caraway cream - This was one of the lesser memorable dishes of the evening, showing off predictable sweet and tart flavors.  seafood 'salsa' - Scallops, mussels and clams were bathed in a jalapeno salsa; a little heat complemented the seafood but this one wasn't particularly noteworthy either.  shrimp, avocado, nori - A strong seaweed flavor and texture came from the fried nori, complementing the tender avocado chunks and grilled shrimp. Black garlic provided a mellow garlicky flavor throughout.  guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - A nicely-chewy ravioli was stuffed with rich and flavorful guinea hen, sitting in a comforting, savory chicken broth. Quite tasty.  CA state bird with provisions - The restaurant's namesake dish did not disappoint. Fried quail (the state bird of California) was both juicy and crispy, while sweet onions and pecorino provided additional depth of flavor. I just wanted more of this addicting bird.  vinegar glazed smoked potato with tonnato - The potatoes exuded a strong smokiness that paired pretty well with the albacore tonnado. Crunchy onion rings added the crunch in each bite.  steak tartare salad with anchovy &amp; castelfranco - We didn't care for this one. Too much salad, not enough steak.  glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi - Luscious, tender ribs were delicious, especially with a slight heat from the togarashi spice. Swiss chard helped to balance everything out with its earthiness.  hamachi spring roll with fuyu persimmon - Cool hamachi and sweet persimmon were a good duo, but the spicy dip overpowered the subtle flavors a bit.  buttery lobster with farro \"spezzato\" - The lobster was cooked well, leaving it spongy and succulent. A very buttery-rich farro base added a creamy starch presence.  sweetbread meatball with quince &amp; pickled veg - There was something kind of chewy inside the meatball, but I liked the flavor. Pickled quince added a sweet acidity to balance the richness of the meat.  red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum brown butter - The trout was well-seasoned and cooked to a nice crispy skin and moist flesh. Hazelnuts and citrus provided some nice complementary flavors to go along with the fish.  'world peace' peanut muscovado milk - moving on to the sweet part of the menu, we began with 'shots' of this milk that really resembled Reese's peanut butter cups.  cocoa pudding, huckleberries, white chocolate buddah's hand crunch - Next we had a rich chocolatey pudding with a lot of fresh huckleberry flavor. The white chocolate brittle added crunch to each bite.  eggnog 'ice cream' sandwich, sherry chocolate coulis - This was my favorite of the desserts, which I thought was executed very well. Eggnog ice cream was delicious, particularly with the soft cookie, chocolate and almonds. A touch of salt was a difference-maker.  This was my favorite meal during my holiday stay in San Francisco. I felt like we tried a ton of flavors throughout this meal and most everything seemed thoughtful in concept and execution was pretty strong. Sure, there were some plates that I found more successful than others, but that happens over 18 different dishes. The spreads/dips, guinea hen dumpling, fried quail, pork ribs, trout and ice cream sandwich were excellent. State Bird truly lived up to its high expectations.",

    "review_text": "Why, oh why, did I consume a $3 slice of pizza before coming here? \u00a0I wish I had come on an empty stomach, but the drunk me after several Friday night drinksies forced me to buy a slice before I passed out on the street somewhere.   My reservation was a late one, 10:30pm, and I had friends in town from Australia and it was her birthday, so it was perfect (especially before closing down for rennovations!)   We were immediately awed and overwhelmed by the process of ordering here. Besides the menu of pancakes, commandables, and desserts, the staff come around with carts and trays of their prepared foods ala dimsum style.  My co-worker told me to get the state bird off the menu, but we were quickly lured to sourdough/sauerkraut/pecorino/ricotta pancakes and the pork spare ribs. I thought the pork spare ribs were more delicious than the state bird (quail). Deliciously tender and the meat fell off the bones. The state bird came with some cheese and tasted like fried chicken. I only had a small piece because I was full. The pancakes could be used to dip in extra sauce, like what my friend's bf did with the leftover avocado dip.  If my appetite would have allowed for more food, I would have definitely tried more plates. Lots more. I mean there was seafood, veggies, and so many other varietals I can't remember. \u00a0  Some of the smaller plates ordered: --This slow cooked egg with trout (flavors were delicate yet decadent) --This avocado thing with spicy flavors that came with chips (YUM) --A dumpling in yummy broth. (should have ordered more than one!)  Next time, I will do it properly by 1) coming earlier 2) coming on an empty stomach.  Can't wait to come back! You can just tell the quality of the food is amazing, the staff really care about their food they prepare for you (cooked with love), and a great atmosphere for hanging out.  P.S. They don't do anything special for birthdays here. We mentioned it once or twice but nothing happened. Sad, we didn't even get to order dessert!",

    "review_text": "Restaurants of the moment are like farts in the wind: one must be at the right place at the right time to experience their essence. I found it auspicious that Bon Appetite magazine declared State Bird Provisions their restaurant of the year for 2012 and that I happened to be binging my way through the San Francisco restaurant scene.  I was not at all daunted by my lack of reservations and you shouldn't be either, unless of course you insist on dining with your coven of foodie friends - Provisions is a tiny restaurant and due to the present buzz getting a seat here will necessitate a lot of planning or a lot of waiting. \u00a0I chose to wait, not in the cramped space along the wall, but at Yoshi's down the street enjoying some smooth jazz and bubbly. \u00a0The text from the courteous host came much sooner than promised and when I arrived back at Provisions I was promptly seated at the counter.  This seating arrangement, which overlooks the open kitchen and the energy and \u00e9lan of the chefs engaging in their mesmerizing saut\u00e9ing, grilling, and assembling, can best be described as cozy. \u00a0One has no choice but to engage with your neighbors since there is literally no elbow room between diners; hopefully you will be seated next to someone that is equally as engaging as you are. \u00a0The small dining room is quite spare and rather boring, the furniture modish and predictable, and the tables nearly as closely spaced as the uncomfortable steel stools which ring the kitchen, and upon one of which my large ass was installed.  So why put up with all this nonsense? \u00a0The food of course - the impressive, outstanding, brilliant food! OMFG! Yes I am too old for that type of tweeny lingo, but it encapsulates my reaction for what was one of the best meals I've indulged in this year. \u00a0  The food is sophisticated without being at all pretentious; don't expect engineering marvels which try to emulate leaning towers of food sculpture or Pollock like squiggles of sauce dribbled across plates meant to suggest cleverness and elegance. \u00a0Rather the elegance and refinement come from the taste sensations in each bite. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, the visual appeal is all there too, but the flavors and the aromas are what distinguish and elevate the food.  The way Provisions works is also intriguing. \u00a0One can order from the menu but even more exciting is the constantly changing little dishes which are enticingly paraded in front of you by roaming servers on trays or carts where you get to pick and choose which dish most appeals; the only anxiety you will have is that they all will. \u00a0These little bites are packed with flavor sensations that will please and challenge your taste buds and blow away any assumptions you may have previously had of what it means to dine at a temple of haute gastronomy. \u00a0This style of eating is fun, casual and allows one to sample a wide variety of dishes.  I loved the quail, which is described on the menu as the CA state bird with provisions. Yes it is fried, which of course means that I would automatically love it, but it had such a wonderful crunchy bread crumb coating that remained crisp and it was topped with shaved parm; wow this little birdy of a dish really does sing. \u00a0  Next up, the Guinea Hen dumplings with aromatic broth; wow, just wow! Two little raviolis stuffed with the meat of another bird and then at the last second the server pours over the most astonishing broth of preserved Meyer lemon and over 30 other aromatic herbs and spices. \u00a0I can't even describe it; you just have to get it. \u00a0I dropped my spoon and lifted my bowl to slurp up the last remaining drop of this heavenly elixir. \u00a0To me, the most revelatory dish of the evening.  \u00a0 Then the cumin lamb with scallions, grapes and zucchini. The arrangement was of shaved lamb, like a gyro, but with the juiciness still intact and the flavors of the Mediterranean out front for my enjoyment. \u00a0The lamb was saut\u00e9ed with delicate zucchini, which was still in its fledgling state with several buds of the flowers just about to bloom. \u00a0Delicious.  I couldn't stop, so I ordered one of the pancakes. Again the description defies what is delivered. \u00a0The menu reads as follows: local boquerones, yeasted-sesame pancake, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. \u00a0What you get is the freshest of anchovies on top of a curiously, light and fluffy sesame covered bready round shaped disc. \u00a0Oh yeah, there are slivered radishes atop as well - this is not an afterthought but a textural foil for the rest of the composition.   I did have dessert too; I ordered the double chocolate pudding with plums and birdseed crunch. \u00a0The plums were served atop the pudding and were a tart counterpoint to the sweet pudding underneath. \u00a0Off to the side was the crunch - a chocolate treat reminiscent of a thin rice crispy treat with a nice crunch to it and a lot of chocolate flavor and a textural contrast to the smoothness of the pudding.  Stuffed and happy. Thank you State Bird Provisions. I look forward to your next restaurant.",

    "review_text": "I got a reservation super randomly (too many people know about the 4am secret. I just randomly clicked once and got a reservation for the next day for 8pm). \u00a0Due to the lack of effort in securing a reservation and the ease of finding parking, my experience started off on the right foot.  Prices were very fair, Dim-sum style makes it interactive and interesting. I'd say 70% of the food, I would order or eat again. Short ribs, uni ginger scallion pancake, roti with Rabbit, and oysters were our faves and are worth 5 stars. The rest, were not:  - State Bird: fried quail. Not as good as just getting fried chicken. Not as juicy or crunchy as well seasoned as the Foreign Cinema chicken. It's also just not a lot of meat on a quail wing.  - some sort of cheese balls with dipping sauce. the taste literally reminded me of the last time I threw up after my birthday party (for the record, I'm in my 20s. throwing up after a birthday celebration should not warrant more than an eye roll. Keep your \"tsk tsks\" and \"SMHs\" to yourself)  -salmon tartare (it was on a dim sum cart). I can't even remember the ingredients but it was underwhelming in taste and texture)  - dungness crab with kimchi. My bf loves crab and korean food, so this was a no-brainer. I don't really have recommendations on how to make this dish better since the pairing doesn't make sense to me, but it was very \"eh\" in his words. Actually, those were exactly his words  We'd definitely come back but would probably stick to the things we already know we'd like. \u00a0But the barrier to trial here is super low as the price point on the dimsum carts rarely stray above $10. \u00a0Great experience, can't wait to return, assuming I can score an easy reservation.",

    "review_text": "Feel like a debbie downer for slamming another place with such glowing reviews but I just can't perpetuate the hype, especially when some of the dishes were so sloppy. Let me start with the memorable dishes: the fried quail was perfectly cooked (and surprisingly) one of the more restrained dishes there. The onions, parmesan, and lemon all complemented each other with the right amount of acidity and salt. The clams and scallops with kimchee, on the other, hand was a hot mess. Between the kimchee and pickled green beans you were left with an overwhelming amount of sourness that nothing else came through. Seemed like every dish had three too many ingredients that never came together harmoniously. To top it off? We were seated for at least an hour and half and still never saw several of the dishes that were being passed around.   You have to give the place credit for it's creativity. That said, I feel like people give creative concepts too much of a pass. If you're going to have an incredibly hard time to get a reservation and win numerous accolades, you should deliver delicious, memorable food. Nothing there struck me in a way that would make me ever crave it again (like Delfina's simple, yet stunning, spaghetti, or Ichi Sushi's unique nigiri combinations). That's why I don't think I'll ever be back again.",

I loved the concept of this restaurant (maybe because I'm a huge fan of dim sum and I get more excited when I can physically see the food I'm about to order in front of my face). My recommended dish would be the braised ox tail flat bread that came around on a tray (not on the menu). The pork ribs were also a favorite at our table. It can be on the pricier side (I think we spent about $100 including tip for just the two of us - but we kind of splurged since it was somewhat close to Valentine's Day) but if you pay attention to how many dishes you're consuming you can stay way below what we spent. I recommend trying the desserts too. A lot of the time desserts can be an afterthought but we went in knowing we wanted to try at least a couple and thank god we did. My favorite dessert was the pear ice cream sandwich.   Seriously. Try this place if you're in Pacific Heights.  God I want to go back to San Francisco.",

    "review_text": "State Bird Provisions is a shining example of why I love the food culture in San Francisco. The entire restaurant experience here is top-notch; definitely one of the best dinners I've had in the city. State Bird Provisions introduces a dim sum-style ordering process to unique, fresh, and flavorful concoctions, all of which were absolutely delicious.  The large open kitchen in the front of the restaurant is definitely a nice welcome. You see a dedicated league of chefs preparing a countless number of intricate and interesting dishes.   There are a few shared plates on the menu, and plenty more that they bring around the room on trays and carts. I love this process because you can see the food before you decide to take it, and you can ask questions with the dish right in front of you. I've never seen anything like this before at an American restaurant, and it really is genius. Be aware though: you will probably end up spending way more than you expected to, because it's pretty difficult (at least for me) to reject any of the dishes they bring around. They all looked phenomenal, and the vast majority of them were.  ---------------------------- A group of 3 of us had the following:  Serrano Ham w/ Persimmon: Fresh &amp; tasty. I could eat these all day.  Pan-seared Trout = Excellently-cooked trout.  Beef Cheek w/ Bone Marrow Vinaigrette = Delicious. The Bone Marrow vinaigrette is incredible and the Beef Cheek was nice and tender.  Flatbread with Oxtail and Curried Lentils = Warm &amp; flavorful. Loved it.  CA State Bird w/ Provisions (Fried Quail) = This was my favorite dish of the night. The fried quail was PERFECTLY fried and the meat was unbelievably moist. This is how poultry should be fried.  Cavatelli w/ Dungeness Crab = Interesting flavor that really grew on me with each bite.  Kimchi Pork Belly w/ Yuba Noodles = Very good take on the Korean flavors. The kimchi flavor is faint, but works very well in the broth. Pork Belly was nicely crisped.  Duck Confit w/ Cornbread = The cornbread is phenomenal. The duck confit was good, but I wish they utilized something different with cornbread (ideally something like foie gras).  Duck Neck Dumplings = Little dumplings that had a distinct duck neck flavor, but the dumpling skin was a little too doughy. Still good, though.  Clam Sliders = The bun for the sliders were great, although I wish the clams were hot instead of cold.  Goat Cheese w/ Vegetable Crudite = The goat cheese was great -- not too overpowering but still had a strong flavor. Goes well with the vegetables.  Grand Total: $61.00 per person, including an ice-cold IPA (and tax &amp; tip). ----------------------------  For a brand-new restaurant, State Bird Provisions blows many SF establishments out of the water. It serves up incredibly fresh, unique, and tasty dishes at decent prices. Make a reservation now and be prepared for an amazing night out.",

    "review_text": "This is one of the restaurants I've kept an eye on, and it's gotten a lot of good press, but so many times places don't live up to the hype so I'm thrilled to report that this place does. 1. Food - Consistently delicious -burrata and garlic bread - generous portion, really good -quinoa and tuna tartar - awesome -some sort of seafood cerviche -state bird chicken - small portion, great chicken, didn't love the 'provisions' -green onion and corn shortstack - highly recommend -farro with egg - this is the only one I didn't love I may be leaving something off, but almost everything was absolutely delicious. Such unique flavors, combinations I hadn't had before, great sauces, etc. I would have liked to see a salad or two as we felt it was it was starch heavy.  2. Service - excellent, surprisingly laid back. I feel like often there are snooty hipster types working at places like that, but everyone was great and down to earth, checked in with us the right amount of time. Even when they called to confirm our reservation, it was nice that they reminded us about Filmore Jazz fest as Filmore street was closed that night.  3. Price - our bill came to $76 before tip. My husband had several beers, i didn't drink, and while we had enough to eat, we weren't stuffed. This is one of the cheapest dinners I've had in SF in a while and while I'm sure we could've ordered more, I was still impressed with how reasonable the prices were for very high quality ingredients.  4. I would return. So often, even if I have a good meal somewhere, I'm still like 'crossed that off the list', always wanting to try somewhere new. This place I would go back to b/c everything was good but their menu is constantly changing. Also, it's not a big to-do. We were in and out of there in less than an hour for less than $100 for amazing food. Interesting concept for SF.",

Other than the food: \u00a0 Service was mostly friendly. \u00a0We arrived at 6pm as walk-ins and got seated around 7. \u00a0They will text you when your table is ready so you can go wait somewhere else.

    "review_text": "For such an interesting food place a proper review should start with the food: \u00a0wow. \u00a0Three dishes were amongst the best this hedonist has ever tried: fabulous crusted lemony quail, brilliantly vibrant (I think tuna) tartar, and a non-earthy, redolently citrus-tasting mushroom dish, an unexpected elegant winner. \u00a0The sturgeon caviar with potato chips, if not totally new (at least if you've been to Swanson Winery's Napa Valley Salon) was at least completely DE-lish!, underscoring I think this restaurant's sense of humor and self-confidence. \u00a0Hey, I even loved the seared calf tongue served in room temp blood red (beet, as I recall) sauce. \u00a0Sense of humor, for certain, and roundly beautiful.  Dwelling on that a tad more, I liked the food presentation. \u00a0Tiny plates are offered on a tray, reminiscent of a dim sum style. \u00a0So cool to be able to look over everything. \u00a0Kind of a fun ice-breaker for dates too, actually. \u00a0I came away feeling the chef really knew how to incorporate a sense of art--textures and colors as well as flavor-- into the meal.  A plus or a minus, I can't tell, but an important detail: \u00a0from the outside you would never know this is a restaurant. \u00a0In fact, I walked by twice even though I knew the address. \u00a0I scratched my head, and took a shot, still thinking \"this can't be it...\" \u00a0 The entrance looks like it's a catering operation from the outside. \u00a0Diners essentially walk past the kitchen to a small secluded dining room, a spartan SF-chic-space composted of unassuming peg board, cement and stone tones. \u00a0The tables are unadorned. \u00a0The food and friendly nature of the place make the experience as a result. \u00a0As a really huge bonus for foodies: \u00a0the wines by the glass are well-considered by the owners, inexpensive ($7-11) and lovely. \u00a0We enjoyed several as the night progressed, using them as wonderful compliments to a round-robin of sophisticated flavors.",

The concept is like tapas + dim sum, though with big groups it's only the prix fixe menu. We had the oysters, heirloom tomatoes, guanciale chawanmush, melon &amp; goat cheese, garlic bread with burrata, pickled local anchovy-tomato toast, \u00a0state bird provisions, and that's all I can remember. I believe it was a total of 17 dishes.   The prix fixe menu is $65 pp. We also brought some wine and got some wine, so after everything it ended up being $125 pp. Even though it was good, it was still a bit expensive for what it was.",

    "review_text": "Ladies and gentlemen, the hype is real. I was less impressed my first time here (about 4 months ago in Oct 2013), but now, the wow factor is everywhere.   Though my most recent experience was marred with a rude and lackadaisical waiter and the fact that some dishes took a longer time than expected to arrive, a few truly outstanding dishes made up for those imperfections.   State Bird Provisions is special because of its dim sum style way of serving food to its customers. Waiters entice you with beautifully crafted dishes while enchanting you with each dish's long list of ingredients. It's tapas style taken to new heights, and I love it. It's an absolute must-try.   Here are the dishes to get (or not to get):  Bacon mushroom and chili oil (+++)  Hamachi with avocado on a seaweed cracker (+++)  Salmon belly with miso glaze (+++)  Glazed pork ribs with tobarashi and scallions (+++)   Rabbit and fontina croquette (++) Duck liver mousse (++) - get it if you really like liver   Garlic bread with burratta (+)  Smoked trout Cold porridge with potato and seaweed (+)  State Bird with Provisions \u00a0(+) - worth the try, but not exceptional  Roti of curry rabbit and hedgehog mushrooms (+)  Guinea hen dumpling (+)   +++ - Must try regardless!  ++ - Really good + - Meh, could be better",

At the same time, the hostess was an absolute sweetheart, and our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and exceptional with respect to, the finer points. \u00a0The real disappointment was the food... The Bird... It sucked, tasteless, boney..lame. \u00a0Major let down! \u00a0The pate, any-bar USA, the oysters...blah, and ice cream sandwich, (how could it suck?) it did! Gonna go back for kicks, way down the road, I'm sure.",

I have always asked for a restaurant like this. \u00a0You know, where EVERYTHING on the menu looks amazingly delicious...making you salivate, but you know your stomach can only handle so much. \u00a0Effing lightweight! \u00a0Man up. \u00a0State Bird is the ultimate small plate restaurant served dim sum style. \u00a0That's right...they walk around with trays of pure amazingness that will send your taste buds in overdrive.  Don't even bother pacing yourself. \u00a0Just take what they bring by...it's well worth the food coma afterwards.  The highlight of the evening was the duck fried rice. \u00a0OMG it was out. of. this. world. \u00a0The air dried beef was killer. \u00a0And don't forget to order the chips and smoked trout. \u00a0Truly one of the most innovative apps I have ever had.  Again, order everything. \u00a0It's not all that expensive for the menu you're getting. \u00a0Also, the staff is so so so attentive and great and the ambiance is fun with great music playing in the background.  A fantastic experience and well thought out, intelligent menu. \u00a05 stars all the way.",
