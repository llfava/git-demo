    "review_text": "Place Pigalle was my happy hour destination of choice for several years, since I worked at nearby City Hall, and toyed with being a smoker for a while. It's a good place to be a smoker. And those places are necessary and I'm glad they exist; I'm not really on board with the anti-smoking crusade thing. I mean if we're fighting a war on corporate carcinogens, I would love to see a major ad budget allocated to dry cleaning, but that's a separate rant.   Anyway, Place Pigalle. It's a chill ass place to run through a bottle of cheap red and a pack of Export-A's with a couple of good friends.   Good times, good times.  I also feel compelled to add that Place Pigalle has been unfairly persecuted, and thus I feel compelled to add a possibly-excessive fifth star.   FOR GOD'S SAKE PEOPLE STOP BITCHING ABOUT SOJU. Do you even understand why so many places have it!? It's not, contrary to popular opinion, because the nightlife mafia is in cahoots with the Koreans, or because they want you to think it's the trendy new thing, or that it's some bullshit copout cheap subsitute for vodka. It's not, like, a CHOICE bars make when they're opening up, like \"Should we serve just beer &amp; wine, or liquor too? What shall we do?\"  There are LICENSES required to sell alcohol. There are DIFFERENT TYPES of licenses within the broader license category; for example, a place that has a kitchen and serves food concurrent with booze has a different license type (a Type 47) than a bar with no food (a Type 48). Similarly, a microbrewery (Type 23), winery (Type 02), and corner liquor store (Type 21) all have different classifications based on what types of alcohol they sell, when, how, and to whom. This is all regulated at the STATE LEVEL.  It's an incredibly arduous, expensive, hard as fuck process to obtain the kind of license that allows a bar to serve hard alcohol without a restaurant component (48), and city neighborhoods often have tighter controls on such licenses. (For example, the Lower Haight has per-block restrictions on hard alcohol. Think about how many beer/wine bars there are on the Lower Haight. Now you know why.)   But because San Franciscans love our nightlife and there's a market to support multiple bars in every neighborhood, many bars do what they can to simply exist, and that often means a license permitting beer &amp; wine only. \u00a0Place Pigalle has a Type 42 (Beer &amp; Wine, On Sale, which means drinking ON the premises versus taking it off, like a liquor store.) And they do what they can within the confines of their license and the regulatory environment to offer you a variety of beverage options. And that's how you should think of soju: as a bonus third option beyond simply beer and wine. Because it's a clear spirit and mixes well but is technically (percentage-wise) a wine, Soju allows bars a workaround to provide you with a cocktail where there would have been none before. I appreciate that.  And just so you know, most of the RESTRICTIONS on hard alcohol licenses (Type 48 \"On Sale General, Public Premises\" no food required) grew out of NIMBYist fear and paranoia that booze = higher crime rate. And maybe it does. But if you think that's a bullshit generalization, as I do, and you would really like to sway our public policy in a more tolerant direction, get educated about the issues and get active!",

As well, I have a standing date every Thursday with this bar, Anye the bartender, one of my gal pals, and a couple of glasses of pinot noir.   I'm not big into cocktails unless I'm watching live music, so a no-spirit bar like this one suits me fine. Particularly when Anye keeps the wine a-comin'.  The unisex bathroom has dilapidated greatly over the past few years, but the graffiti is, at times, entertaining. I really wish it could be done-over, but it's not bad enough to keep me from coming back.   The music is random but entertaining. I don't agree with those who say it's too loud, but I only go on Thursdays, so I can't speak for the other nights. I'm sure Mr. or Miss Bartender wouldn't mind turning it down if they're asked nicely, though. Just an idea.  It sports interesting and changing artwork. The couches are comfortable and reminiscent of basement rec rooms, but I never find myself in the back unless I'm waiting to brave the bathroom.   The clientele runs the gamut from yuppies to dirty hippies to symphony/ballet goers to hipsters to dogs. It's a comfy place and I always meet interesting (or at least entertaining) people there.",

It has a comfortable, laid back feel. But it lacks the uber cheap prices of the common dive bar - forgive them, they are located in Hayes Valley after all.   What I like most are the variety of seating options. There are couches, from the front to back of the bar, which is rather large. There is a pull table in the middle of the back room. My friend and I sat in a booth in the back which felt very private.   The drink options aren't amaaazing. The wine I had was good, but rather pricey. They serve La Crema wine, which I think tastes just like grape juice. So all and all, you can easily purchase some of the wine they serve in a corner store in the mission paying the same price for the bottle as you do for a glass at Place Pigalle. This is in no way unique to PP. This is done virtually everywhere in the city. I just happened to know the wines at PP. Thus, I am not taking a star off for that. What you're paying for, in my opinion, is the atmosphere, and I like the atmosphere at PP a lot.   The other patrons are young for the area, which made me feel more at ease. Different age groups mix together though, so it's not like a young mission bar.   I look forward to coming back here.",

A cozy bar area in the front, pool table in the middle, and nice open airy plush couch seating in the back. It was a perfect place to meet up after the baseball game, they have tvs for those who don't make it to the ballpark and plenty of restos nearby if you wanna bring in a late night bite. Pssst... Don't get food from the Mediterranean places closest by, Hayes &amp; Kebab, it's no bueno! With only one pool table be prepared for the take turns :) however, with ample space in the back of the establishment, you will have no problem grabbing a seat, standing around a seating area, or making your way to the bar and back. There are also a great deal of boutiques nearby, so be sure to check out this area in the day time!",

It doesn't smell like old beer on the floor and the bartender shared his pizza break with a homeless guy. That's downright sweet.  Nice atmosphere in a nice little spot.

I asked if they took credit card and he just kinda looked at me and nodded in a pompous manner. \u00a03.)

The space is dimly lit, but cold. The walls are barren and reflect sound way too much. The music of often too loud and displays any lack of creativity whatsoever. The bar is too high for the stools! Even though its the only \"neighborhood bar\" in Hayes Valley (a neighborhood I love), it doesn't really feel like one. You can't have a decent conversation in there either.  The incessant smoking of people either inside, or right outside the door adds to the problem. Also, there is a decided, if unintentional feeling that nobody attractive goes to this bar. I don't know how that's been decided, it just seems to be the case. I feel like Jeremy Clarkson in Top Gear when he describes an Audi or other german car. It has all the elements of a pretty nice place, but it just feels soul-less and dull.  Place Pigalle is only good if you are meeting up with 2-3 good friends and want to have a beer in an unpretentious setting.

They tended to look a little run down but again, this is a dive bar. Cute little bartender. They need to give her a step stool though. It was really difficult for her to pass the pints over the beer taps. Management, do you think you could help a girl out?  Anyway, have to give them a star off for the tool that wouldn't leave me alone from the time I walked in. Group of about 5 or 6 dressed in what looked like Asian Army uniforms completely wasted at 5pm on a Sunday afternoon. Apparently their most suave seemed to think that I was dying to make conversation with him. The guy clearly had an alcohol induced speech impediment. It was funny in the beginning but started to make me anxious when he kept touching me. No one seemed terribly concerned but I also wasn't making a scene about it. I would not recommend this place for females going by themselves. Go with a girlfriend, go with a boyfriend but don't go alone.

They have an excellent draught beer selection, but that's about it. The pool table is typically broken and/or missing one of the balls. The bathroom is terrifying--sometimes flooded--albeit with excellent graffiti. The bartenders are nice and, depending on which one is working, have good taste in music--which is key because they're in control of the iPod in the back room.  If you're in Hayes, it's a nice place to get a beer, but not really destination-worthy.",

I have to take a star off for the listed prices. \u00a0Four bucks &amp; change for a Prohibition is high. \u00a0$6.25 for a Hoegaarten is silly. \u00a0And $4.25 for a bottle of Corona is highway robbery (however, with a beer selection like PP's, you deserve what you get for ordering Corona). \u00a0These are not dive prices. \u00a0However, when you buy three drinks, and one is on the house, this pretty much ceases to be a problem. \u00a0Four-and-a-half stars.

So, after giving them the table, we went to the pool table. \u00a0The guys followed saying \"oh, you think we're good at foosball, just watch us play pool!\" \u00a0Look buddy, I don't give a $hit about how you play. \u00a0I'm here to hang out with my friends, not be harassed by some loser who hangs out here as if it were home.  So, after patiently waiting for our turn on the pool table, some chick runs over and starts racking the balls. \u00a0My boyfriends said \"oh, that's my name as the next player on the chalkboard, actually.\" Instead gracefully apologizing and moving aside to wait her turn, she says - \"WELL MY NAME WAS ON THERE BEFORE AND NOW ITS NOT.\" \u00a0So, what in the hell does that mean??? Instead of getting in an argument, my boyfriend says - ok no problem, I'll just wait and go next (he's so sweet!) \u00a0He leaves for the restroom and she starts laughing with the guy who was playing the last game. \u00a0So I guess they were friends and lying so they could squeeze another game in? \u00a0WTH?! \u00a0It's not that big of a deal people! \u00a0If you wanted to play again, you could have just said so - we didn't care that much, \u00a0LOSERS!  At the same moment my bf is walking to the restroom, some drunk lady with her dogs starts pointing at him saying \"that's him, that's him!\" \u00a0I look at her and asked her if there was something wrong (in a very nice manner) and she says \"YEAH THAT GUY KICKED MY DOG AND LAUGHED!\" \u00a0With a bit of a laugh that I really couldn't hold, I said WHAT? \u00a0No he didn't - when did he do that? \u00a0She said, oh maybe it wasn't him. \u00a0I said um, ok and walked away. \u00a0No need for a useless argument. \u00a0My boyfriend steps out of the bathroom and she runs to him \"YOU KICKED MY DOG AND LAUGHED!! YOU KICKED MY DOG!!!\" My boyfriend half laughs and asks WHAT???? When did I do that? \u00a0She says \"LIKE AN HOUR AGO!\" I then walk up because I'm not having any of this and say \"LOOK LADY, WE JUST GOT HERE LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AGO AND HAVE BEEN IN THE BACK PLAYING FOOSBALL!\" \u00a0Eventually she calmed the hell down and went back to her seat - but kept staring at us and talking about us with her friend.  Seriously, why are you even bringing your big ass dogs (YES MORE THAN ONE) to a bar anyway? \u00a0We are actually VERY pet friendly people but this was too much. \u00a0  We finished our ONE beer and proceeded to the next bar without all the drama. \u00a0This place was WHACK! \u00a0Too bad for the bartender as well - we all work or have worked in the bar business and are great tippers. \u00a0Sorry your bar groupies sucks!",

(my resolution this year is to visit 50 new bars in SF. \u00a0read about it at: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffiftybars.thisisvlad.com&amp;s=90470ef2a294ec5a8b83db337f40edb798ccaa93834eb5d3cc4e655df9ffd07a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">fiftybars.thisisvlad.com</a> )",

Honestly we went back last night because of her service (nothing against the other bartenders who are good)...and are happy with her addition.

But it's key selling point, which not enough people have mentioned: DOGS. The night I came to this place, there were not one, not two, but THREE dogs running around and hanging out. They were the cutest.  If you're dog-deprived living in your tiny city apartment, it's great to get to go hang out with other people's dogs in a situation where you don't have to ask \"do you mind if I pet your dog?\" as you awkwardly lurch towards a dog on a leash.

I slugged through my allagash white and the boyfriend liked his west coast IPA and our trooper of a third wheel Colbert T. said his anchor steam was just fine. My beer was kinda tepid--I enjoy a good frosty glass or at least the beer cold and Place Pigalle doesn't offer that.   There's a bunch of couches that are great for sitting but also, in my opinion, kind of dirty. Not my cup of tea but not the worst place to be dragged on a slow Friday night. It was super packed which made for some good hipster watching. It took me a second to realize I had been there before but for a very dead happy hour.",

They also have wine on tap (When asked how that works--Is it pressurized? Can't be, right?--the bartender replied \"I don't know the SCIENCE behind it, I know it just works.) The wine it limited, just red and white blends, but I get it embarrassingly often, considering all the awesome beers here.  They don't keeps tabs and they don't take credit cards for orders less than $12.

Now being that I worked for a Medical Device Company I thought of Place Pigalle as some stuffy high-end bar, the likes of which my four-inch heels would never see the inside of.   I was wrong on both accounts.   I have been to Place Pigalle several times - last night being the most recent. It is dark, a little dirty, and the music was way to loud. However, they have a pool table and a decent selection of beer, wine, and even sake, which is a nice offering. I don't think they serve anything 'harder'.  The place seems to attract a very local crowd, so it gets 'stars' for that..especially since I feel like all of my standard places in the Mission have been invaded by the under 25 crowd. Plus, the bartender was really cute (if you are reading this I was the girl in yellow and the guy I was with is NOT my boyfriend). An extra star for the eye candy.   Still, I can't imagine my former group of senior staffers visiting this place since it was full of greasy-haired tight jeans wearing boys who were bopping along to the Janet Jackson that was blaring out of the stereo. Come to think of it maybe that conference room was named after the 'red-light' district in Paris. Ewww, gross! Dirty bastards.  If I was in the area I would go back, but no special trips.",

This is the location of Moulin Rouge and countless sex shops. If a little TB, a few whips and dildos as well as some side alley prostitution don't scare you then this area represents sex, and I, personally, like sex (though as a disclaimer I must say I am not a huge fan of TB nor side alley prostitutes who, in times past, were proud carriers of the TB).  This area is said to carry some of the best musical instrument shops in the world. Now, this doesn't help me much since, aside from some brief success with the Violin that I wasn't motivated enough to pursue, I am a complete wreck at playing any instrument. However, I like music and admire greatly anyone who can master an instrument.   Place Pigalle was once also home to the studios of many of the Modern Art Masters; Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, Van Gogh all painted here to name just a few, and if you know anything about me you know I would cut my left ear off to own something by any of these artists.   So, Place Pigalle, the little bar in Hayes Valley, has a lot to live up to.   Yes, they have music, but it has never struck me as mindblowingly good, its just there drowning out the chatter of a mellow crowd of beer and wine drinkers (No hard alcohol here).   They have artwork, which is constantly rotating, but I have yet to see any pieces that have inspired me to even trim a fingernail for, let alone cut off an appendage.   They have sex. Oh, wait, not they don't. In fact the only logical place for a quickie in any bar would be the restroom, and since the entire damn bar has to share one single bathroom sex is most definitely out.   Sorry Place Pigalle, I know you try hard and you are okay to pop into for a beer, but the name is all wrong. I think you ought to leave this one to the French.",

I remember the good old days when I lived at Eddy and Laguna, gun shots popping off daily, living with the female version of The Dude with an unfortunate and uncontrollable rage disorder...

It was always the favorite go-to spot on the way home if I wasn't quite trashed enough and needed a few more beers to finish off the night.  But of course, some lurker had to creep into the picture and crap all over my sweet spot.   The place has just the right mix of toothless daytime drunks and hipster kids chaffing their balls with their tight tight pants so you always have tomething fun to look at, and laid back neighborhood types to offer some palatable happy hour company. But unfortunately \u00a0it turned into dank and musty cavern harboring would-be date rapists and leg humpers.  Ugh. Tell me why a girl cannot go into a dive bar in the middle of the afternoon by herself without being chatted up by the most desperate and socially awkward guy in the place.   I mean admittedly one night I was that girl with a long trail of toilet paper flying freely off my shoe after breaking the seal in the unisex pisshole placed unfortunately in pool cue range, and maybe I did take a quick second to nibble at a hang nail that was bothering me all day, but that does not give your pit-stained and greasy self permission to get all up in my personal space, make a drunken yet failed attempt at eye contact, and try to whisper in my ear that you really like nail biters. Especially when I happen to be on a date at the time. Gross.  And tell me why said awkarkd guy has to be there each and every time I went back in hoping to make equally intrusive and unenjoyable conversation with me regardless of whether or not I was there with someone else.

And these creepers just can't get enough of me when I'm two beers deep and grinning uncontrollably with that post-work warm belly fulla beer feeling.   No I'm not flirting with you, I'm trying to get drunk... Lay off chester.  So until that dude finds a new place to socially infect I'm staying away.

    "review_text": "It took me years to really enjoy a good beer. I always liked my mixed drinks, and was a snob for a good martini, but a beer, that takes a palate in my opinion like wine. You have to weed out all of the piss water and really get to the good stuff. Leffe blonde, Chimay red label (or blue as well), Newcastle brown, and a good Hefe. Place Pigalle offers a variety on tap, minus the Newcastle, but tonight they were out of my three top picks, which left me with nothing too exciting to choose from. This didn't help me, for the fact that I was going to be enjoying my marginal fourth choice beer on a couch with a rip in the middle, where I couldn't even seen my feet it was so dark. I was lost in a midst of hipsters in hoodies, dirty cons and bad thick rimmed glasses. Instead of being trapped in a Gap ad, I felt like I was standing next to one of the most recent covers of Adbusters, where a hipster, classically dressed in the garb described above graced the cover. Offering their recycled clothing options as fresh and new instead of the regurgitated used clothing fronting as \"underground\" that it really is. Nothing beats American Apparel, Parliaments, and PBR, right guys!!!!  Don't get me wrong now, I do like myself a good dirty dive bar here and there. My bartender was great, and my bro I was kickin' it with made me laugh my ass of, of course, otherwise I wouldn't have two stars up in those boxes above. For a local night, pool and a few beers wouldn't be too bad, but the back space where it's located along with some foose ball isn't really personal at all. It's almost like the back of my high school gym where we hung at theatre class in between production set changes.   The major bonus of the evening was when I got hungry at an unmentionable hour, I was able to walk right out the door and go down the street to Absinthe, where Brad, my wonderfully helpful manager, was there smiling to greet me, and feed my sorry ass. All dressed up and no where to go.",
