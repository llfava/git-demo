Brass Tacks is what I feel fits the area currently. \u00a0There are friendly and informative bartenders, a list of cocktails with interesting names (The Spanish Prisoner, for instance) and a relatively lively crowd. \u00a0Signage is subtle on the exterior and interior, the decor is not elaborate.  Awesome place to stop for a drink, although, it can be relatively pricey.",

The bottom line, the bartenders are unique and friendly, the drinks have character and the ambiance and decor are fun. The location is great, well it's in Hayes, so of course it is.   Just a tip, It can get a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings and seating can be hard to come by.",

Drinks are priced right, thus placing Brass Tacks in the same competing neighborhood bar category as Place Pigalle down the block. Although Pigalle boasts a better craft beer selection, Brass Tacks has all the liquor options &amp; cocktail concoctions. But I'm all for having more libation options in Hayes, every bar has their purpose!  Get the window seats if you come by daytime, you get a direct view of Patricia's Green to people watch while the sun is shining in. You can plan your next move from here, whether to get some ice cream from Smitten, or perhaps a healthy juice from Juice Shop, or onwards to Biergarten for some more day drinking!

That said, meeting colleagues after work in the Hayes was fun, in particular, this bar, was a great find. Drinks were good. Space was open. And staff was friendly. It's a bit of a young crowd, but I have no problem pretending that I was still in my 20s. While drinking a cocktail, my colleague, the engineer was showing me the new app his team was building. Then, my other colleague and I chatted about France. Two young marketing gals showed up for more drinks. Yep, it's a quintessential San Francisco tech heavy scene. We are in the middle of a gold rush. I remembered the last boom like it was yesterday. I told my colleagues \"Back in the day, I'd come here on dates, buy one of kind clothing, and feeling hip. Then we'd all hang out in North Beach for late night (drinking) activities and for the morning after, Bloody Mary served in any number of restaurants in the Marina. That, of course was before those areas went on to become full on touristy and stuffy.\" They looked at me like I was some eight-headed *ancient* creature. Hayes Valley was hip once, yes, like it was the Mission. Now Hayes Valley has become fully yuppified, overrun by French tourists.  Youth is the most valuable currency of all, and yet youth is wasted on the young.

The 'bouncer' on the night of August 2, 2014. I walked into the bar while he was out on the curb puffing on his e-cigarette. Yells \"Hey KID\" and demands my ID. In shock I fumble with my wallet and accidentally drop it. Keep in mind I had no drinks at this point and had just come from smitten across the street and was in a pretty good mood. He then proceeds to tell me to take a big breath (in front of all of my friends) and completely humiliates me. Calling me kid, assuming I'm intoxicated, and generally just giving bad vibes.  Despite the location and selection, as long as this faux-hipster bearded vaping loser is bouncing here, I won't be back.   Note to management: don't hire douchebags as bouncers. Sorry not sorry.",

    "review_text": "I'm very happy about a new bar in Hayes Valley, owned by someone who is also responsible for Churchill. There's a lot of similarities between the two, starting with the hip/trendy/industrial/wood/metal/leather lounge look. You know, like the place where you'd go sporting a smart mustache and raw denim jeans that's cuffed. Another similarity are the serious cocktails. The drinks are pretty strong and dressed up with fancy ingredients. I found it to be a learning experience. I had Her Majesty's Secret Service, which was strong and woody. It was similar to an Old Fashioned, but with more to it. I also tried the To Wong Foo and also learned the reference. It was sweet and strong. Any drink with grapefruit flavor is good in my book. I tried the Valley Club with gin and it tasted summery and sweet as well. There was also something called Knife in the Water, which was no cocktail I've ever seen. I forget what was in it, probably an apertif, but it was served in a tiny stemmed glass and looked like a solid amethyst crystal. The Hella Berry Rum Punch was okay. It had a generous amount of berries in it, but it didn't seem all that well mixed. Some berries were added in the end for garnish rather than flavor. The beers on tap were nothing new to me, except the Bockor Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge. It was a Belgian sour beer served in a very small glass. It tasted like liquid dried cherries. The draft Racer 15 and canned Oskar Blues Pale Ale was a favorite among my group. Bartenders were nice and friendly, but also very serious about their craft. They can definitely use more people behind the bar though. This place gets crowded very fast because it's not that big. I liked that their background music is played with vinyl. There are 2 restrooms and a digital jukebox that is placed way too high :(  This place is also DOG-FRIENDLY!",

What I think is really the seller for me and why I dub this place as \"classy\" is that their \"well\" liquor is actually decent. I know this fact because when we ordered tequila shots, the bartender picked up the tequila bottle from the well. I was about to stop him, but the bottle read \"100% blue agave\" and then when we had it, it was actually pretty smooth. In all likelihood, most people probably don't even care, but as a bartender, I am definitely sold on this aspect of this place. Personally, when my friends want to go to Biergarten, I would rather just go down the block and come here... but I am usually overruled :( . However, we always come by here afterwards :) . It's also a great place to hang out if you have just put your name down at Patxi's on the other side of the street and are expecting a 45 minute wait. However, even if you are just looking for a place to come and hang out with some friends, I would definitely recommend Brass Tacks. As I said in the beginning: a CLASSY dive bar.",

The music was good, but incredibly loud, so after awhile we moved venues--it was just too piercing. You have to scream to hear each other. The crowd was very homogeneous, but no wonder given the ubiquity of the design. This place needs to find an identity and integrate itself into the community if I'm going to come back. There's no trace of Marlena or the old place anywhere, which is sad and disrespectful. San Francisco is painting over itself. The service was very good though and the drinks fairly priced.",

The Secret Service was a bit more toned down and I really liked it. But all the rest of the drinks I tasted - overly sweet, or tangy or just something that would be hard after a couple sips.  ENVIRONEMNT: On a Saturday night, packed and loud. Shouting to be heard loud over the other patrons and music. There's some seating in the back. Overall decor-wise, it was pretty yuppie standard. Drinks get mixed in lab beakers (which I dislike as it gives a weird feeling of your bartenders not being able to measure correctly).  SERVICE: I'd say the bartenders seemed on top of their game.

Back when I lived in the hood (before it became the posh Hayes Valley 2.0 that it is today), my girlfriend and I would grab a night-cap there and chat with all the regulars (everyone from hipsters to drag queens). Plus, they had a smoking section adjacent to the bar (this was back when I occasionally smoked). And, of course, Marlena's was famous for their over-the-top Christmas decor during the holiday season.  But alas, all good things must come to an end, and Marlena's was sold to new owners last year and transformed in to Brass Tacks. Needless to say, I was skeptical of the new tenants and their new cocktail lounge-y concept. Fortunately, I'm pleased to report that Brass Tacks is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. The interior is a complete 180 from the old Marlena's. They have a shiny new bar; plenty of black leather couches; lots of modern light fixtures; and open window seating. The place is definitely a nice mix of sexy and comfortable.  Brass Tacks boasts a solid mixology program. All the featured cocktails incorporate a gourmet medley of spirits and flavors. I ordered the Salem's Lot (bourbon, punte e mes, lemon, apple spice). My friends ordered some sort of fancy rum cocktail.  Now I won't lie to ya - the drinks here aren't cheap ($10 a pop). And they each take 5 minutes to prepare. But if you don't mind the wait and the price, I think you'll be rewarded with a tasty beverage. Who ever created their cocktail program certainly knows what they're doing.  Although I miss Marlena's and its colorful characters, I think that Brass Tacks is going to do just fine in this neighborhood. And judging by all the young hipsters and yuppies who showed up for happy hour, I think this bar is off to a great start and can expect to be around for a long time to come.",

The bartenders are knowledgeable and fun and Matty even went so far as tracking down a hard to find gin at a store downtown so my wife and I could impress friends back in Germany.  Short of getting rid of the tv's I can't think of a single thing you'd want to change. As near to perfect you could get in the real world. Bravo Brass Tacks!",

    "review_text": "Maybe I'm jaded... I haven't written a review in ages, and at the end of the day, my excitement about Brass Tacks, is based on the question \"Where can I get a drink after work, without a schtick?\"  Working near Hayes Valley there are plenty of places to get an afterwork but there's always a schtick.   Only beer or wine... Mostly food... Incredibly pricey... It's outdoors and too cold to hang out... Theme bar with only 20ish seats... Whatever the heck is going on at Sugar.   Remembering Brass Tacks had just opened after a new teammate completed their first full week on the job was incredibly helpful as we could certainly not all fit in the space left at a certain pirate bar was a huge win.   I know that a lot of reviews have remarked how underwhelming the decor is, but who cares when all you want after work is a stiff drink and somewhere to enjoy it?! Joking aside- inside the bar is certainly nice, and I have no complaints- then again that was not a concern on my first visit. Bartenders are incredibly nice and make sure everyone gets taken care of with stiff delicious libations. What more do you really need?  Excited to go back and try more of the specialty cocktails.",

    "review_text": "A group of us met up here on a Wednesday night at about 9pm. It was not too crowded (plenty of room for 6 of us to hang out at the bar), but still lively.  The bartender was really nice. They'd run out of their pretzel so he gave us a free jar of spiced almonds.  * Blood on the Sun ($10) - 4.5 stars Bright red/orange color, and delicious. A great mix of sweet and tart, well balanced.  * Salem's Lot ($10) - 3.5 stars A lot of well mixed flavors, but on the strong side for me.

Hardwood floors and blown glass lighting give the place a more modern vibe. And they're still dog friendly. Pretty awesome. The bar tenders were nice enough to make us a couple of mimosas and chat while some old school hip hop played in the background. Can't wait to hang out here more.",
