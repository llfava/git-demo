The pluses, which are minuses if you like everything nice and tidy, include:  * A large raised stage, amplification, bands wailing on trombones and trumpets straight into the face of the audience a few feet away * Not a whole lot of service, on slow nights you go to the bar and order * It's not fancy, but very dark, very red, and full of brick walls, paintings, atmosphere * Haphazard, sparse, random furniture... but this means you can show up with a group of ten and have a conversation between numbers * People applaud every song, the more the band wails the more they applaid  If you're used to East Coast jazz clubs, here is what San Francisco has in store for you:  * No cover, no pressure, \u00a0no drink minimum, no seating rules, no tip jar, just show up. \u00a0How do we do it? \u00a0We must be stoned, and we're not in it for the money. * A small but good selection of very good craft beers, real strong drinks, courteous bartenders who know what they're doing * Regular happy hour, and late night happy hour 12-2. \u00a0After 2 it's illegal, but it's 5 in New York so you can pretend. \u00a0A couple blocks away there are restaurants open until 4, this is the latest neighborhood in the city.",

Great music- there was a folk/bluegrass/tango(?) trio the night I went. Although there was no cover, the band did pass around a tip jar, which was strange.   There was a pretty good beer and wine selection- some items were bargains ($5 for an Allagash? Hell yes!) \u00a0while other items were somewhat overpriced ($10 for a mediocre glass of wine? Hell no!). Have yet to try the food, but it looked pretty tasty.   Overall, it was a solid first visit and I would go back to check out the other musical acts. The bartender mentioned that there is sometimes improv as well, so I think management is still trying to get a feel for who their clientele is.",

    "review_text": "I was practically raised with the love for singing. My parents had karaoke machines in our homes from when I was but a wee one all the way 'til I mved away for college, but I hadn't really done any \u00a0serious singing for public consumption since the end of high school. I still loved to sing but the idea of singing in public had over time become more and more daunting. This changed when my friend invited me to karaoke night a couple of weeks ago.  To start, the KJ (that's karaoke jockey for the uninitiated) Dana was super friendly and fun. She was engaging, fun, friendly, and a pretty good singer in her own right. She kept the crowd engaged and excited throughout the night. The crowd was full of different sorts of folks. Some were really good singers. Intimidatingly so! Some were...really enthusiastic, and some used the stage \u00a0for differnt types of performance art (like the two guys who did \"Chop Suey\" last night. Only one of them sang the whole time. The other guuy just stood there until the last two mins when he broke into interpretive dance). Overall, the people who go seem really friendly and justt really out to have a fun night. Sometimes the idea of singing in public ccan be really nerve racking. Such a light-hearted atmosphere really helps llighten up the mood.  The staff there are really friendly too. Everyone from the bartenders to he bouncer are really cool, yet still courteous and professional. As someone who doesn't drink and who can often be a bit shy, bars can often be a difficult place for me to socialize and have fun but I was able to at this placee.  If you're looking for a fun, light-hearted, maybe a teeny bity gutsy way to spend a weekend evening, this place is worth checking out!",

You have to get used to stuff like that. Besides, the inside is basically the opposite of the outside.  50 Mason is one of those rare nice bars that serves nice drinks and appetizers without seeming all uppity and pretentious about it. The decorations are beautiful but not ornately elitist, the seating is varied (booth-style for groups, small tables for singles and couples, far from the stage, close to the stage, etc) and it's big enough that you can actually get up and walk to the bathroom without tripping over anyone. In fact, it's less bar and more lounge. There's also a stage for live performances, well-located at the back of the establishment but sort of awkwardly shaped. In any case: A nice little gem in the TL.",

The service was quite friendly, the happy hour prices quite reasonable. \u00a0Note - it is only beer and wine. \u00a0The \"cocktails\" are made with those, not spirits.  Very good selection of beer, ok selection of wine - but they were out of several when we were there and only had 2 reds in stock. \u00a0That needs to be fixed oif only a beer &amp; wine place.  Interesting section of art work on the walls that rotates every 2 months. \u00a0Most (but not all) are for sale if interested.  Seats at tables are very comfortable. \u00a0At there bar there are backless stools and a few tall chairs with metal backs (with camel cutouts in them). \u00a0While cool looking, they are very wobbly and clearly in need of repair. \u00a0I can see someone wobbling on one of them and falling over after a few beers.  The place had a musty, dusty, mildewy smell to it. \u00a0Once or twice during our short time there I actually had to cough from what felt like a mouthful of dust. \u00a0They need a couple heavy duty air cleaners in there.  The area is pretty sketchy - so don't plan on driving and parking near. \u00a0But in these days of Uber/Flywheel/etc. why drive anyway. \u00a0Also note that it is a bar - so 21 and older only.

Inconvenient because I can burn 600 calories and perfect my form before consuming 700 calories in wine and Trumer...Convenient because after a day full of a total of 5 hours of working out and dance classes, I REALLY need a drink or 3.   Avoid Open Mic nights (Mondays) at all costs. Really- these are not mentally sound people for the most part, with the exception of the one girl who had a really sweet voice but impeded conversation with my companions nonetheless...  I really like the bartender, I really like the scene, and I really like the overall vibe and what they've done with the place as well as the location. This is a joint I can walk into in my dance gear and workout gear just as comfortably as I can in a minidress and heels. I like that in a place.   My only qualms are that the wine is a bit steep and the fact that they have an open mic night, although it did seem to draw a bigger crowd than usual. The people working the bar, however, and the sweet as pie yet intimidating-enough-to-make-me-feel-safe door man are super cool, though, and make it well worth the visit. Beer's reasonably priced and it's a great space for a big group. These guys need more visitors, you really ought to give it a try.",

There's not much of a food menu. This venue is also in the tenderloin, at the edge of it, so there are a lot of homeless on the street (so be careful!).

It was kinda cool, kinda creepy with lots of beds &amp; couches &amp; people doing strange things in the bathrooms. Now, there's a cool hangout spot upstairs with live music. A big improvement!   The first reason to knock off a star was that they advertise that they open at 5 &amp; have happy hour. Well, we tried to go in at around 5:15 last Thursday night &amp; they weren't open. We just wanted to get a few drinks before an event at the Warfield &amp; this seemed like the perfect spot, plus I love checking out new HH spots. Oh well. We vowed to return later that night.   So whatever time it was after the event ended (I'd had a few by then), we came back. There was a band playing &amp; a few people were seated on couches enjoying the music. We weren't really there for the music, nothing against the band or anything but we just wanted a drink &amp; a spot to hang out before heading home for the night. We sat near the front, away from the band &amp; chatted while we had our drinks. Maybe we were too loud? I dunno (as I said, I'd had a few) but I think the band was annoyed by us. So we finished our drinks &amp; left.   I would definitely come back since this seems like a chill spot to lounge around &amp; have some drinks. It's a welcoming place on a stretch of street that is less than desirable.",

    "review_text": "Stopped in here last night to see my friend's band play a gig. I remember being here with friends about two-or-so years ago, but that was under normal circumstances.  As a redesigned Tenderloin building, they have to work around the building's construction for their aesthetic. I bring this up because it's one of the many SF bar venues where you have to sit at the right angle, lest a pillar block your view of the stage.  The drinks, moderately-priced, are good. Everything comes in a glass specifically designed for it. I didn't have time to try the snacks this particular evening, but I enjoyed having my drinks in my incredibly comfortable seat. I'm not kidding - they spent good money on the cushioned seats and I could have sat in one of the leather ones forever. Hell, I thought of walking out of there with one. (Just kidding... they're too heavy for one person to move on his own).  Though you can only talk in raised voices most of the time (even when a band isn't playing), it's a relatively mellow place to stop in for a drink. They have a wide selection of international beers and wines; they welcome an eclectic roster of musicians; they cater to a diverse clientele. If you stop by, there's sure to be something there that you'll like.",

I found this gorgeous club bar while wandering the streets one evening, avoiding the shadiness and attempting to find somewhere I wouldn't get hassled by middle-aged men with nothing better to do.   I spotted the neon sign and the words happy hour written in glow marker from across the street and passed by to take a peak. Nice corner stage with live music that starts at 8pm, gorgeous leather lounge furniture and a huge bar to sit at. There were about 6 other young people, in couples or alone so I decided to go in. The cute bartender Jordan was super friendly right off the bat and announced I had two minutes to the end of happy hour so which would I like to drink? I chanced the Zin which was excellent for a house wine and had a wonderful conversation with him about living in the city. The other patrons where also very nice, everyone finally getting into conversation with eachother. I really recommend this place, and the prices are fair for being downtown. I wish them the best of luck! (the Tenderloin could really use some chicness once in a while to draw in young people) PS. Cash only but there's an ATM at the door",

The spot also has nightly happy hours and nightly live music which is a big plus when looking for places to hang out without breaking the bank.

We snatched it up and we had been sitting there a good 2.5 seconds before a homeless man approached from the other side of the glass and started touching himself. He knocked on the window and tried to get our attention. No wonder the table by the window was available. Every single homeless person who passed tried to get our attention.  Aside from the interesting view out the window, the ambiance INSIDE this place is awesome!! It is a pretty cool location that just serves wine and beer. The strange thing about this is that there are no sizes listed on the beer menu. Each one has a serving size, but you don't know until you get it and think \"omg 8oz of beer, what a rip off\" or \"omg 1 gallon of beer, how the hell am I going to finish that!\" I just think they should list the size.  I would recommended checking this place out though, it is pretty chill. they have happy hour 12am-2am if you are interested in being in the TL at that time.",

    "review_text": "Alright so I love the decor and openness of the place. Totally awesome! - 5 stars. Very comfy furniture, cool stage setup, and has great flow.  They had a band their last night and we stayed for a couple of songs and they were pretty good, some outfit from Denver.  I know it's located in Union Square/Tenderloin area so I understand high prices, but two drafts $13 is a lot. I know they have higher end beers on tap but that did seem a bit excessive.  Also, their happy hour is from 12am - 2am, great if you are a night owl and like the TL that late, but not so good if it's after work or early evening. If you change that (ownership, are you listening?) I'll probably come in around the 6pm time and enjoy the place more often.  Sum up - cool place, a bit expensive, and beer/wine/soju only which is fine with me.",

    "review_text": "50 Mason Social House is truly an amazing place. They havn't been around that long but I've already seen a couple really great shows here. \u00a0The ambience is really cool, hip, yet warm and inviting. Great selection of beer on tap &amp; wine. \u00a0I don't know if they plan to get a full liquor license or to start serving some food in the long run.   The acoustics in the room are really nice too very warm &amp; somewhat bright. The stage is size is excellent for a 3 piece band with a small kit although I've also seen some larger bands play there &amp; they just spill out onto the floor in front of the stage.   While it is true, they aren't in the best neighborhood in town the experience \u00a0of hanging around the area is on par with being by the Great American Music Hall or Slims. \u00a0Plus your a hundred feet from the Powel Bart station and all the muni lines. Despite what another reviewer mentioned I found the guys working the door did a really great job of keeping the crackheads from loitering around in front. While we were smoking out side one or two of em came out to ask for some spare change and before I could even respond the door man whisked them away. \u00a0  Especially for a brand new business it's incredible how many things this club does perfectly. I'd imagine that in the comming years this place could very well become one the City's go to spots for nightlife!!",
