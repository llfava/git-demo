We didn't really take a look at what we were walking into but I figured it was a strip club. My roommate didn't. Her reaction was the best.  The place is really big and has an old classic look to it. We weren't particularly interested in the strippers so we walked straight to the bar.  Check in and you'll get a free drink (but it's limited to beer, wine, non-alcoholic). I got a glass of their house chardonnay and my roommate got a White Russian ($8...meh). Bartenders are pretty chill. Drinks were whatever.  Strippers are everywhere (obviously). They're pretty cool. They're not aggressive unless you want them to be. We were just watching them.  Anyway, we were just there to kill time but the place wasn't bad. An experience!",

I was about to be let in free by the bouncer, but we told them we wanted the couples deal. It was a bit dead when we went around 9pm, but got crowded after an hour or so.   girls- alright looking, very friendly. Some will ask if you want lap dance. Only like 2 girls really could work the pole. The others just shake their booty, crawl, dance in front of the mirrors, hold the pole and dance around. I really liked this one girl who could really work the pole and did some sexy lap dance moves. She had a petite body and kinky when she performed on stage and private lap dances. She put the tips i put down on the stage and tucked the money in my bra (i dressed up for their lingerie event, but i was the only one who dressed up). She then took the money from my bra with her mouth. It was cool. She did other kinky stuff during our private lap dances in the back room, but those will remain unsaid. ;)  private lap dance for 2 people is $60 and $10 outside lap dance (stage area) They played pretty good music too! It was a 2 people for 3 songs special night for $60.  I noticed this couple in front of the stage. The woman looked drunk and kept cheering the strippers on and was like dancing.   overall, interesting experience. I had 1 lap dance from this tall blonde chick and 2 from the petite girl. Sadly, I don't remember my 3rd lap dance because I was wayy drunk.",

As with any club, the dancers vary significantly in body type, style, talent, and how engaged they are with their dancing and the audience. \u00a0While I was there, I saw three performers. \u00a0One was alright, doing the sway-and-pose. \u00a0The second seemed totally disinterested in being there, and I'm not sure that anyone tipped during her two songs because she seemed so bored! \u00a0The third performer was pretty spectacular - a woman with a curvy, all-natural body, very gymnastic and clearly having a good time on stage (or really good at faking it). \u00a0She was wonderful to watch, and I sort of wish I'd stuck around to watch her when she came up again.  I didn't pay a cover, but the weak gin and tonic I had was $6.50. \u00a0The waitress was friendly and pretty prompt. \u00a0The DJ was completely unintelligible, never could understand what he was saying about the dancers or specials.",

Every night is a great show, with a variety of dance styles and, my favorite, the super-tall pole that dancers will climb up and suddenly drop down.

It was like each girl had an image to portray. The belly dancer rocky was amazing, never seen anyone move like her. Kinder had amazing costumes and outfits. Astrid was absolutely alluring. Franky had this beautiful steam punk sort of look to her and was an amazing short haired beauty. They gave away prizes, they had funny skits in between. This club was an experience that I will never forget. On top of that, I'm in the navy and was hoping to show my other friends in town for fleet week the show. Even though he said it was in not a monthly thing, their general manager, mark, told us to give him a call and he would get as many of the girls together that he could to put on another show.

After chatting with Maylee, I found out that the dancers at the club were pulled in from other Deja vu clubs around the city (hustler club, showgirls, gold club, etc). \u00a0Which made sense, since most of them didn't seem too happy about being there. \u00a0But at least the girls weren't all about the hustle, like they were at some other clubs we were at (ahem SHOWGIRLS ahem). \u00a0These two twin blondes from vegas worked the pole really well, but when a couple in our group wanted a lapdance with both of them, they disappeared--what's up with that? \u00a0turning down money.... weird.  Anyway, the layout was unfortunate. \u00a0The bar in the middle looked really awkward. \u00a0And the stairs in the center (probably going to the dressing room for the girls) looked like it belonged in a bordello of old. \u00a0The poledancing stage was a little awkward too--not quite large enough to house the people, but at least it made the dancing a little more \"intimate\" haha.  The far end of the bar is where the lapdances took place, and it was mostly empty all night--probably because they had only been open 3 days. \u00a0They had curtained off booths which looked strange, cause there wasn't space for lapdances there. \u00a0weird. \u00a0anyway, it all seemed like it needed a little better planning.  not too bad overall though.",

The manager, Mark, is also extremely friendly and helpful. The staff is top-notch! If you want the ideal experience, be nice to the girls, and for God's sake, tip them! Those girls work hard and as it's been said previously...they don't get hourly. If they look disinterested, it's most likey because people are acting like it's a free show. My favorites are Luna, Michelle, Marisa, Stella, Milana &amp; Ryan. Lux is full of dry humor and moxie. Head in if you want to be entertained, not offended. :)",

My friend and I were drinking in Chinatown, decided to wander over to North Beach for some food and this place looked really cute inside.   The manager was super friendly, sat us in the bar area and even bought us drinks. We had nachos, which were exactly what you'd expect at a strip club. Delicious nasty cheese sauce. The food did take a bit longer than usual but it's all good, we were enjoying the view anyhow. The girls are really cute, and really sweet. Not your usual tore up looking strippers, these girls are young and attractive.   The decor is really nice, clean bathrooms, and I love love love the main stage area. It's very old school and classy, more like a burlesque old fashioned type of stage.   My friend ended up losing her keys that night and went back to the Condor the next day to see if she left them there, negative, but she said they had a live band playing that night. Sweet!",

Girls of different races and sizes, so there's someone for almost everybody. I get bored at clubs where all the girls look the same, but Condor isn't like that. The only thing I don't dig is the music. I think the DJs have to play stuff that represents the club's \"image\". Other than that I like the atmosphere. Neat vintage-y decor.  Just so you know, strippers don't get paid a wage. They actually have to PAY the club to be allowed to work. So don't be a douchebag- if you're not going to get a dance, at least tip the ladies. And contrary to popular belief, strippers ARE people. It's not necessary to be rude or talk shit if you don't like a particular dancer. And don't waste their time. They're at work. People seem to think it's easy money, but it's not. Even the most gorgeous girls have to WORK for it. So if you go in with a good attitude and are nice to the ladies, they'll show you a good time. :)",

I've walked by this place on many, many occasions in the evening and I have to say that it wasn't as skeevy as I thought it would be. The side entrance looks just like a regular bar (somewhat burlesque-y/saloony in d\u00e9cor). And the bigger room off the main entrance looked like a dark burlesque-y restaurant (actually, it kind of reminds me of Spaghetti Factory's decor - fancy brothel), complete with booths, a stage, and flat screens encased in gilded frames... classy.   If you're in the area, you should check it out. Too shy? Check it out in the daytime. But, It's not touted as the first topless and bottomless entertainment venue for nothing.

I was at an another innocent evening at Nick's Crispy Tacos (I explored the $2.00 quesadilla aka fried tortilla sans cheese). I was hanging out with a friend from out of town, when her dad pops up from out of no where and whisks us away on an \"Urban Safari\". What is an urban safari one would ask? Me, in the back of a zebra print-painted truck wearing a safari hat while being forced to sing \"In the jungle the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight\" while my friend's dad cracked jokes about his ex-wife. Personal. Hell.   Anyway, after visiting the giant red balls at 101 California (insert cheesy joke about \"giant red balls\") and walking around Union Square in a pith hat praying to god I didn't see anyone I knew, we ended up at the Condor Club. Strange, yes. Sober, completely.  Her dad proceeds to tell us one of the urban legends from the 80s surrounding this place. I like the way the bouncer told it to us, though:  \"So the manager was fucking one of the dancers on top of the piano. And this piano wasn't any normal piano, it was this super tricked out one that lifted and lowered from the ceiling for special shows and shit. Well he's doin' her right on that thing, and rumor has it that he embezzlled a shit ton of money or something. They think one of the other guys whoops and hits the switch and the piano goes up in the ceiling, crushing him. And he was really fat, so the chick was totally fine. It was murder for sure.\"  After laughing at this wonderful display of storytelling (oral tradition didn't die with the mesopotamians), he lets us all in to actually see the piano.   I walk in and see a very flat-chested stripper doing a pole dance on the main stage. I immediately wonder if my less than gratuitous rack could earn a buck or two. Damn those student loans! \u00a0We go to the main bar and get hollered at and welcomed by the bartenders--which was reassuring! Then we make our way to the piano.  Sparkley and white, it still hangs from the ceiling. Who knew such deep history could be found in such a hedonistic place? I gotta say, for this reason, I like the Condor Club. I really do. It's trashy, it's dark, it's got a story. It's not just your run-of-the-mill strip club. Hedonists enjoy!",

We got in and I asked for that draft beer. \u00a0Hostess said no that's only for Sunday. \u00a0I was like what the heck!? You have a sign outside that says so and your valet/bouncer said the same thing. \u00a0But I didn't want to be too much trouble so I just said I'll get a rum and coke and so did my friend. The music sucks to be honest. \u00a0I want some nice upbeat, almost club like music to get the girls all hyped up to dance. \u00a0But we got old school rock that almost put me to sleep. \u00a0At the back of my mind, I was expecting to get rick-rolled or something by the MC. So now on to the dancers. There was only 3 dancers when we came by so we all watched them perform twice. \u00a0 First dancer was ok, Kiki's her name I think, she did her thing and she got some tips from us. \u00a0She has excellent butt that looks like a peach and it was oh so good to look at. Third dancer, Michelle, was phenomenal!! All she did was took out her rag, doused it with rubbing alcohol and started wiping down the pole. \u00a0I was like, oh sweet, I like a hygienic stripper. \u00a0But she did it in a very sexy and seductive way and the tips started coming in before she even danced. \u00a0Then she started climbing that pole all the way up and came down all spinning and doing crazy pole gymnastics. \u00a0I was like daaaaaang, *throws dollahs* She was awesome and though she's a bit petite, I really like her. The second dancer . . . . ..well she's gonna be forever be unnamed by me. \u00a0I'll just forget her and just focus on the positives instead, ok?  Place is quite dated and stale for me. \u00a0The bar section is a lot better than the stage and all I only spent 3 minutes to compare the two. \u00a0I personally think Gold's Club is a lot better venue than this.",

That is until you put them in front of a pole, a girl, and a pair of platform heels.   The Condor, with its tops-off-bottoms-on policy, was perfect for my queerly oriented, morally conflicted entourage. I spent the next 2 hours immensely enjoying the almost-naked acrobatics and listening to two of my favorite comedic minds wrestle with the desire to be above objectifying the female figure vs. OMG boobies.   Before the end of the night, I had arranged for a joint lap dance for my buddies. When it was over, their favorite girl led them back to their seats, leaned down to me and said, \"They weren't awkward at all.\" \u00a0  Overall, it is a very comfortable bar and stage. The girls are fun, and the House Mom even came over to introduce herself and make sure we were having a good time. Great for the lady lovin ladies, and those who don't care to find out if the carpet matches the drapes.",

Time flies and soon the lights dim and the curtains get closed. \u00a0Buxom babes start entering the venue and being to swasted...we still do not understand until the show has begun. \u00a0Strippers come out to the bar to lure us into the showroom. \u00a0Giggling like little children, reliving our high school days when we used fake IDs to get into titty bars, we ran to a booth and fixed our eyes upon the stage. \u00a0The first chick worked the pole pretty well however, the second chick made the night. \u00a0Coaxing us guys to the front while the girlfriends were chortling behind, she allowed a couple friends to motorboat, instantly making their nights...shout out to lil hootsies. \u00a0  In this business, the girls pay the club so it's their job to swindle. \u00a0However, the majority of the girls were not that pushy and were pretty rad. \u00a0Realizing that we would not buy dances, they decided to accept drinks as payment for time. \u00a0While our girlfriends looked on in disbelief, round after round was tossed to the back of our tonsils, making me too scared to check my wellsfargo account. \u00a0  The Condor is an old fashioned titty bar. \u00a0It's fun to come with your friends and get blasted with Rick the bartender or observe the clientele with lowered brimmed hats. \u00a0Be careful if you come with a significant other...motorboating even in jest can lead to a debocle of Hiroshima proportions...bhaahahahah",

It's the oldest strip club in the city, so it's got a lot of history behind it, and that's pretty cool. It's got that classic old - fashioned strip club vibe, with the red velvet curtains, classic - looking bar, and artwork that you can tell has been there since back in the day, like the girl with the light - up nipples. It's also got a piano hanging from the ceiling by the bar. I'm not sure if it's the same one that crushed a manager and a dancer while there were having sex on it when the hydraulics kicked in and smashed them into the ceiling, but it's pretty cool.  But that's not why you go to The Condor! You go to get drunk! Just kidding. The drinks are alright, normal pricing for a strip club, which is not cheap, but they do have a lot of really good drink specials pretty much every day.  Well, none of this really matters if the girls aren't hot, right? Well....yeah, they have some pretty hot girls. As with many Broadway clubs, there is a very wide variety of talent. Some more...talented than others, but they've got tattooed girls, thicker girls, skinny girls, strippery - looking stripper girls with their fake tits and whatnot. Only saw a few pole tricks, but the funny thing about strip clubs (and probably the most important to remember) is that they are subject to change every night. The vibe, the energy, the dancers, the probability that the cops will show up....  Fucking Broadway. Gotta love it.",

Shortly before 6pm, all the curtains were pulled down and the place was getting ready for its core business. \u00a0Some men moved from the bar to the other side and grabbed a booth to settle. \u00a0A tall lanky blonde appeared in a swimsuit. \u00a0A brunette w/ 2 piece showed up 5 minutes after. \u00a0Shortly after 6pm, the show began. \u00a0The fog machine and color lights came on, the blonde went on stage and started pole dancing to \"I'm just a Giggolo\"...interesting.  The place is not what I had expected. \u00a0It's small. \u00a0Decor of the bygone era - red plush vinyl booths, red armchairs, red baroque wall paper and curtains, even the restroom is all red - bright red subway tiles, deeper red wallpaper with gold accents.  The old carol doda neon sign is now hung on the wall as you enter. \u00a0There is a b/w picture of the infamous wired piano lowering Carol Doda onto the stage hung at end corner booth next to dj. \u00a0There are VIP booths on the other side - these are the more initimate booths for 3-4 with long red baroque curtains that can be closed off for privacy - wink wink.",

It has a faded Victorian decor, like you wormholed into a saloon from the 1800's. The aging, fraying of upholstery parallels the wear and drudgery on the faces of dancers. Maybe it was because i got the day time crowd, but as terrible as it is to say, the fish, for the most part, was not sushi grade.   Regardless it is a fun time. The creepers are too busy distracted by tits so for the lushes, you can easily have a free for all with the reasonable alcohol. They do their $5 5-7pm jagerbomb specials so if you dig redbull and jager, go nuts. One of the bartenders, Rick, is quite the merry fellow but has a silvery tongue capable of jedi mind tricking you into going several rounds deep.  Bottom line, Condor is an excellent choice for occasions that demand social gatherings at adult venues. As we all know many gatherings require such places right?",

Anyways, the 3 of went to the club -- and considering we were all in our running clothing they surprisingly polite. \u00a0We went in through the side entrance -- a little flirting goes a long way (ok, at least it gets you in with no cover).  We sat down, ordered our drinks and enjoyed some boobies.  I should mention that we were all pretty drunk at this point -- we met another group of people enjoying themselves and became friends with them quickly. \u00a0One of them was a Librarian -- a sexy librarian. \u00a0No, she wasn't a stripper. \u00a0She decided that she wanted to treat us to a private dance. \u00a0Hells yea!  The 4 of us crammed into one of the booths and we were introduced to the stunningly graceful and gorgeous Serenity. \u00a0She was really sweet and talked to us -- we had a round of shots and she um, entertained us. \u00a0At some point someone decided that it was my friend's birthday -- so, let's just say she got a little more attention...  I think one of the best ways to judge a (female) strip club as a female is in the bathrooms. \u00a0Snobby places the girls tend to ignore you or even make you feel uncomfortable or intimidate you. \u00a0This is certainly not one of those places. \u00a0You can have a fun conversation in the bathroom with friendly strippers.  Anyways -- the patrons were also really nice. \u00a0We got several free drinks/shots -- and we weren't there to pick up men or take advantage. \u00a0People just seemed super chill. \u00a0Had some nice conversations with some of the other patrons and the bartenders were all really nice.  One of my friends ended up getting really trashed. \u00a0The guys were mostly nice when I asked them to leave her alone -- they actually just seemed concerned. \u00a0They helped me get her water -- which she mostly spat back on the ground (Sorry Condor club).  Anyways, our second visit there we were a lot more sober, but the bouncers recognized us and got us and 3 other guys in for free. \u00a0Serenity was there being her awesome self and took the time to chat with us. \u00a0In general the girls there don't seem to pressure people for dances -- that's how I think strip clubs should be, you should want to give them money and not feel pressured or obligated.   This place is awesome as far as I'm concerned!",

Stroll around China Town and North Beach and it's kinda dead. We stop by a random Columbus Street Italian resto for some wine and minestrone. Yawn, might be a good night to hit the hay a little early and rest up for a long Monday of seeing the sites. Ah, f' that! I suggest the old standby Saloon (thttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-saloon-san-\u00adfrancisco#hrid:tVaRtXo_NYpWZ12LqVPzzQ/src:self) that is always rowdy with a live band on Sunday afternoons/early eves. Dang, packed with no available seats and the band is on a break. Time to cash it in?  C'mon! It's North Beach! It does happen to be the Sunday night of Thanksgiving weekend, but if there is anyplace in California on this sleepy day of all sleepy days to rock this is the place.   Sure enough, we walk around the corner and there on the sidewalk are several dancing fools grooving to a psychedelic old school 60's \"Frisco\" kinda band. Heck yeah, lets grab a seat. We are warmly greeted and there is much commotion on the stage. It seems that a regular, \"Gabby\", has worn out her guest singer welcome and the bouncer is removing her sack-of-potato-style from the stage. Finally we have some life going on.   The band was drunkin and decent, the crowd friendly and also entertaining. Gabby was repeatedly extracted from the microphone, replete with expletives, but all in good humor from the lead singer. Faak I love this neighborhood. AND....I got my 1st free drink for doing a Yelp check-in. YAY.  And then,.....bouncer man starts drawing the heavy drapes shut.

Nope, next door happens to be an adjoining room with pole dancing nekkedness. OK, half nekkedness.

Bartender was very friendly, drinks are cheap (probably cause they want you to spend money on the ladies), and location is perfect. During the day (when it's a music venue and not an \"Adult entertainment venue\" the curtains are open and it's a nice spot to people watch (right on the corner of Columbus and Broadway). It's a very old-fashioned stripclub, with a nice feel to it.  At 6pm sharp the curtains closed and the ladies came down for their show. Pretty ladies, didn't stay for the show, but my friend did and he enjoyed it.",

I have to say...most of these girls were not hot at all. Some of them didn't really do any pole work or anything. I mean, I'm no strip club critic, but there definitely is a difference between a higher-end place and a crappy club. The Condor was kind of sad, really. The mirror behind the stage had hand prints all over it, the strippers didn't look too 'into it'--I don't know, it was just mediocre for me.",

    "review_text": "Wow. The Condor is a classic. Much like Mary's Club in Portland, the walls at Condor are decorated with framed photos of dancers from days gone by, newspaper articles and cartoons from the 1950's- and let's not forget the crazy white piano hanging from the ceiling, the same that allegedly killed a gangster in the 40's or something. You have to go back to the private dance area to see the piano, but they let my friend and I just look around. Maybe that's because we are fine ladies, I don't know. We went on a Monday and it was not crowded, but not totally dead either.   I don't care what other yelpers say- when I go to a strip club, I want more than just boobs. I want history, or a sense that something interesting and different is going on. Maybe I'm just jaded because I live in Portland, land of 100 strip clubs, but a bunch of super hot girls in a boring environment is not as fun for me.  Dancers here, at least on a Monday night, seem to be a bit older with curvy bods that Tyra Banks would call \"fiercely real.\" There was a range on the night we went: from a black-haired tattooed lady doing impressive pole work to Danzig, to a sexy Ecuadorian MILF with bedroom eyes who just sort of rolled around with a smirk. We liked her a LOT. Otherwise, the dancers did have an unfortunate tendency to look very bored, even unhappy. A little smiling could really lift the energy in the place.  I wondered what working there would be like, and asked the Danzig dancer for more info. She said you can make money, but the management charges different house fees for different girls \"depending on your standing with management.\" I wasn't sure what that meant- either you get a deal if you're super pretty, or you blow the boss to pay less. Regardless, these ladies are PAYING TO WORK HERE so make it rain when you sit at the rack!",

It was my boyfriends birthday and his sister ordered some food, it was impressive and better then I expected from a bar/topless bar. The owner was super friendly and gave birthday boy a giants pint glass he was dying to own, super cool...he loves that cup. We came back later that night and once again we had a great experience! The staff super friendly even the bouncer was polite.. The whole experience all around stellar!!",

Bought a pass to all four (Garden of Eden, Condor, Little Darlings and Roaring 20's which are all owned by same company) clubs for $50 which is a good deal.   Walked in and took a seat at the stage. The girls were a little above average, nothing awesome, but nothing terrible either. A few of them did some cool/fun pole tricks which got the crowd cheering and hooting. Some of the girls were very energetic and really made it fun, the others did their thing and walked off without much money....so be it.   Drinks were very reasonable. 6 top-shelf cocktails for $48 is not bad in a strip club! Waitress was nice, not pushy, and kept us filled up. Alot people in there, and a pretty cool vibe from the crowd.   We are not huge fans of just topless clubs, but they are a good way to get some cocktails, and then for us, we go back to the full nude spots...so the wrist band is perfect to be able to do both by just walking across the street.",

I had a great time talking with Nicole, and she also gave an amazing dance. will definitely visit again, hope that Nicole is still there. Dutch: Een hele leuke tent. we waren op zoek naar een club om wat te drinken (alcohol) en entertainment. vriendelijk ontvangst bij deur, niet van dat geschreeuw zoals bij andere clubs in de buurt. we hadden een mooie plek voor het podium. heb heel leuk met een meisje gepraat, Nicole, die ook nog fantastisch gedanst heeft. echt een aanrader, kom hier zeker terug, hoop dat Nicole er nog is.",

The girls are pretty cute, and I think all the ones we saw were natural, no fake boobs that we saw. Some of the girls seemed really out of it and very into the mirror and not the audience, but other girls were very energetic and friendly. There was one cute girl in particular who was super talkative and perky so we ended up getting a dance from her! Another girl we liked her look and were spending money during her dance, but when she got off the stage sat next to some guys who didn't end up buying her a dance though we would have if she came to us, we were obviously interested! Drinks were a bit pricey, but they didn't pressure us to drink a lot so that was good. Overall great experience!",

NO STAR FOR YOU!    The indian stripper chick was... well i don't know... it's like one of those times when you're not sure how to react, so you just knod your head and smile politely while applauding lightly for her effort. But in your mind you're like WTF is going on here!?!  The bar behind the stage, was cool. \u00a0The bartender broads were cool, but was surprised that she didn't know how to make a henn-drop. \u00a0Suppose to be a shot of henny and red-bull. \u00a0Instead I got a mix drink of henny and redbull with ice. 1-star for you bartender.  Now I know that hella people is giving this place 4-5 stars because of it's historical past and all, but F#@K HISTORIC VALUE. \u00a0I CAME HERE TO DRANK AND SEE SOME TIT-TAYS! CLAKITY-CLAK!

    "review_text": "The Condor Club is a Gentlemen's club on the corner of Broadway and Columbus in the heart of North Beach. \u00a0The club has quite a bit of history as it was originally the first topless burlesque in our fine country. \u00a0The original Condor closed decades ago, but the club was recently re-opened by Deja Vu as restaurants and bars came and went.  As you enter the club, the stage is directly in front of you with seating surrounding it and about five or six booths for groups. \u00a0A few flat panel TVs hang on the wall to air the game or music videos. \u00a0Furthermore, the club has the best bar of all the gentlemen club's on the strip. \u00a0The bar is on the opposite side of the stage, but is quite spacious and typically is the center of the action with another mini-stage behind you where another dancer can practice her moves.  The bar itself can get a little busy, packed, and crowded, especially on a Friday or Saturday night. \u00a0There's drink specials every night and beers run about $5 with mixed drinks along the same price, premium liquor running a little higher. If you don't want to wait for the bartender, seat yourself in the other room and have the cocktail waitress get your drinks. \u00a0The club also have a menu with surprisingly good food including fries, burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, enchiladas, quesadillas, and more. \u00a0The food is made at the Hustler Club and brought over since there's no kitchen at the Condor. \u00a0The food can take anywhere from fifteen to twenty minutes to be served, depending on the crowd.  The area behind the bar houses a very private and spacious VIP section, which I find to be much more nicer than other clubs in San Francisco. \u00a0VIP dances go from $40 and up, with specials throughout the night. \u00a0The strippers range as many come and go throughout the year. \u00a0Additionally, as some work at other clubs in the city, you might run into a familiar face from one of the other clubs. \u00a0Furthermore, the club has a broad range of girls including white, black, Hispanic, Asian, middle-eastern, etc. \u00a0  You can count on having a good time at The Condor Club as long as you have money. \u00a0If you don't have money or refuse to tip or get a lap dance, don't bother coming. \u00a0You waste the time of the girls and look like a cheap-ass. \u00a0However, if you come for the bar, stay at the bar and the girls will not bother you. \u00a0Don't be afraid to buy them a drink! They will remember you and won't talk smack about you to the next girl.",
