My boyfriend LOVES there Thursday night Lamb Shanks and I'm a straight shot for the cole slaw and chili. Each night they have a special and the food is priced extremely reasonable.

Table service, forget about it. The beer was good! After we finished we looked at each other and said at the same time, should have goon to Lefty O' Douls!",

The bar has dozens of beers from throughout the world--now that I'm living in the area, I guess I'll have to give 'em a try!  I got the BBQ Brisket dinner plate with salad and potatoes for $8.50. My beer, a bottle of Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour Red Ale, set me back $6 on top of that. The beer's a bit steep, but the food's absolutely worth it. 5 stars, will be back again--soon!",

I came here quite a few times with friends and coworkers as I work in Civic Center. It's a short walk north from City Hall. If you're lazy, take the 47/49 bus up Van Ness... You can't miss the building because you'll definitely notice its wildly-colorful exterior!  I've had meatloaf, turkey leg, lamb shank... You name it! The meats are all nice and juicy and flavorful. And since the portions are huge, I recommend sharing them with friends. Most entrees cost less than $10, but the only thing that I have griped about is that it's cash only (yes, I am THAT person...), so make sure to stop by at the nearest ATM or Walgreens to pick up some cash if you're like me.  It's also a great place to come and grab drinks in the evening. There are TVs to watch games on, so you won't get bored if you're by yourself.",

I just get out of AMC Van Ness and Yelp up a place to eat with my friend Phil. \"Tommy's Joynt looks good.\" I say. \"It has 4 stars, pretty good. Seems like they have sandwiches there. Hot Pastrami too.\" Phil agrees and we head over.  Upon entering, the place was packed. I can see why it's a joint--it has that joint feel to the place. TV, bar, tables, food, and people enjoying themselves. Phil and I stared at the menu for a good 7-8 minutes I think, trying to figure it out, because it's not really an organized menu and could be produced better, despite them wanting to keep a traditional feel to the menu. Fortunately for Tommy's, this place is so well established that it seems like most people coming in already know what they want once they get there, so the menu really isn't too much of a problem.  After listening to what 10 people ordered that Phil and I let cut in front of us since we were still looking at the menu, we finally decided to order. I asked the person behind the food counter what he recommends, and of course he recommends the special since it's the most expensive. Phil ordered a Hot Pastrami, and I got the Ox Tail Special and Hot Pastrami, since I figured the likelihood of me coming back was slim anyways since I'm rarely in this area.  Phil then whispered to me, \"the guy just wiped his sweat on his hand...\" and then I looked and saw for myself..he wiped his sweat with the top part of his hand. Now I'm not particularly picky in terms of cleanliness with food. As long as it's not spit on, poisoned, or tampered with, I'm okay if a little sweat gets on my food....okay now that I think about it, no it's totally not okay. I hope some of the sweat didn't drip into the food...  Anyways..after paying (my order was about $21..pretty expensive in my opinion..) we found a table and started eating.  The food was pretty good. Honestly for me they were good, but not mouth-blowing (mind blowing, but mouth blowing, get it?). The oxtail was delicious, and the sauce reminded me of a Filipino dish my mom makes at home. Some sort of tomato paste base with a lot of flavor. The hot pastrami was good, but the bread was mediocre. I really believe the bread helps make or break a sandwich. The sauce they provided to dip the sandwich in helped de-toughen the bread at least. The separate bread and butter that came with my ox tail however, was terrible. Rock solid, tasteless. It reminded me of the leftover bread that's given out at the St. Anthony's Foundation Dining Room that I volunteered in--and even the people there didn't eat it.  The table we chose was 'cleaned' but there was still rice and some sticky residue on my chair that I just put a napkin on before sitting down.  This place has a homely feel to it for many people I'm sure. It's like the MacLaren's Pub of How I Met Your Mother, or the Central Perk coffee shop of FRIENDS. But if you're in town and you're not a local, this place isn't a \"must-go-to\" spot in my book, but if you feel like checking the place out, you won't regret it (although your wallet might).  Overall, I give this establishment a solid 3.5, but I'll be nice on the Yelp scale and give it a 4.",

This place has a wide variety of meats. \u00a0Today's special was lamb shank with potatoes and carrots, there was a big turkey, and a big roast, which my friend had, it was not red like the girl said but, kind of over cooked for my taste, but it was some what late, I suppose.  If you're looking for reasonably priced home cooked meals that your parents might have served, this is the place.  Sometimes I drive pass Tommy's and there is a line out the door. Now I know that the buffet line is near the door, not just because it's busy inside.  It's just one of those place you have to try once in San Francisco.",

Didn't have to wait too long on a Friday night, and with the bar near, you can stand in line and enjoy the wait. Refreshing? A bartender who really makes a drink. No skimping here, and ultra reasonable prices. ($4 for a dirty martini or Makers Mark &amp; Coke?) Food? Delicious. Lasagna was cheesy and to die for. Mac &amp; Cheese - excellent. The biggest meatballs I've seen on the sandwich they serve. Several side items were sampled and all were delightful. Generous portions! \u00a0 The brisket was a little on the dry side. Sauce didn't do anything for it. \u00a0No big deal, just won't order it again. I am from the South, so I admit to being somewhat of a BBQ snob, however, the other guest was a CA native and shared the same opinion.   Tommy's Joint was a fun experience - and certainly worth trying out. The staff behind the counter were efficient and fast.

A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.\"  I have to thank the old man for bringing me and another friend here - my goodness, he's getting some more stars for that one...

Though this was my first visit, I was dissatisfied to the fact that my meal was served at a relatively cold temperature (not warm, as one would expect). I opted for the \"Daily Dinner Platter.\" At $8.50, I certainly would not complain of the price -- as it came with a choice of mashed potatoes or vegetables, beans or salad, and bread and butter. Moreover, you get your choice of meat (roast beef, bbq brisket, corned beef, pastrami, ham, and turkey). I opted for turkey.  For the exception of the mashed potatoes, everything else was near room temperature (bread and turkey). The food certainly would have tasted better had it been warmer! Thus, I would rate the food three stars.  However, the service was friendly, the food was cheap, and alcoholic beverages were exceedingly affordable (and strong). I'm rounding up to four stars.

You walk in a seemingly tiny door and as soon as your eye adjust, you see a full blown tavern of rustic Americana.   There are ropes directing a line to the carving counter, but it took us all of 2 minutes for the wait. They have a ton of daily specials and combo meals to choose from and when you finally decide what you want, you move on to the sides and desserts. The cashier checks you out and when you find yourself a seat (lots of additional seating upstairs), the beverage lady comes by to take drink orders. Be mindful though, she wont give you change if you were expecting any.   The prices are decent for the amount of food you're getting, the wait is short, and you wont have to worry about finding somewhere to sit. This is one of the best places to eat at lunch if you're down for a feast.   Be warned, this place isnt \"fine dining\" obviously from the picnic table clothes and such, but its a great place to be if you don't have somewhere to go in a hurry, or if you're catching up with old friends.

Known for serving up traditional American fare, on a very empty and grumbling stomach I ordered a corned beef sandwich and some buffalo stew. \u00a0The corned beef sandwich was pretty tasty, not the best I've had, but the meat was quite tender. \u00a0The buffalo stew was satisfying but the chunks of meat were not as tender as you'd expect for meats that are slow cooked in a stew.  Came in starving, left very full, heavy and bloated. \u00a0Had to walk around for about an hour before I felt comfortable again.",

The food is served cafeteria style where you get a tray, look at what's behind the counter and order what you want. \u00a0But none of the entrees were pre-made, only some of the deserts. \u00a0I ordered a German sausage (forgot what kind) on a roll. My wife go the bbq brisket with mashed potato, bread roll, and baked beans, which we both shared. My kids shared a bbq beef sandwich. And my niece got the pastrami sandwich with potato salad.  My family loved everything, especially the bbq sauce, which was sort of a hybrid of a gravy and bbq sauce. \u00a0I thought the sausage sandwich was just ok, but the bbq brisket was excellent. \u00a0the mashed potatoes were creamy and the baked beans were cooked perfectly and wasn't overly sweet. Even my daughter enjoyed her food and she doesn't even like beef too much.  The only down side was the service. \u00a0The servers were a bit pushy when I was thinking of what to order, and there wasn't anyone behind me at that time.  All in all, great place too eat with very good food and inexpensive too boot.",

Over sixty years old now, it'll never change, and why should it? It's a damn shame there aren't more hofbraus in this town. Lefty O'Doul's is the only other one that comes to mind, but Tommy's is in a class by itself. What class, I don't know. Maybe Driver's Ed. No. P.E., definitely P.E. when I was the last one chosen for dodgeball because I acted all squealy-girly when a rubber sphere came at me at the speed of light.   But I digress. Jamie W. and I were starving after seeing \"Up in the Air\" at the AMC Van Ness. No hofbrau in that movie. Tommy's just as I remembered. Like a crowded lodge hall with heat lamps, slabs of meat, and the men ready to carve into them - all on the right. Still pretty cheap when I look at the familiar menu signboard (see photo). I went traditional and had the $7.75 Corned Beef and Cabbage with little boiled potatoes (see photo). It's quite a helping you get with three nice-sized slices of the corned beef, and they have horseradish with a mule's kick on the table.   Jamie had Tommy's Big Corned Beef Sandwich on a sourdough roll for just $5.60. All our meat came from the same, heavily brined slab of beef, and yes, it was good eatin', for sure. A mobile waitress makes the rounds picking up drink orders, and the formica tables are meant to be shared with strangers as you both compete for the pop-up napkins. I still like the neon sign that says \"Hot Corned Beef Cocktails\" (see photo), and also the big-boobed woman in the lavender-laced bustier painted in the mural. How do you not stick your head underneath her cleavage? Yep, Tommy's Joynt won't ever change.   FOOD - 4 stars...good hofbrau eats in generous portions  AMBIANCE - 3 stars...like a rotary club dining room  SERVICE - 3 stars...slow when you think how fast they serve 'em up at Katz's Delicatessen in New York  TOTAL - 4 stars...you can't knock good corned beef.",

    "review_text": "My boyfriend has been here once before, and after seeing it on Diners, Drive-in's and Dives, I decided i wanted to try it myself. My mom and bf both got the chicken caccatori over rice and mushroom sauce, I got the chuck steak sandwich with onions, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes and gravy over everything. YUM. We also got a side of the buffalo chili.  Firstly, i want to point out that this entire meal only cost $23!!! My mom was happy that it was about $100 cheaper than most of the dinners we go out to. I was happy that it was just as good as those more expensive places and definitely just as filling.   The only real reason I cant give 5 stars is because I guess since i saw the place on tv, i was expecting something out of this world amazing. It didnt meet those expectations, but if i didnt see it on tv, it would have exceeded my expectations of a small very casual restaurant for only $6 a pop. Im sad cos i used to live very close to tommys and never went in, now i moved a bit further but i can say for sure we will make the journey up there again \u00a0very soon.   O ya, service wise, we didnt interact much with the wait staff because there was no menu, no food delivery, and no check. You order when u get there, they make it for you right away and put it on a tray, you pay, and then take it to a table. Good for people in a rush or that dont like to wait for the whole paying process at the end, like me!!",

Order anything on the menu. Go home before, after or during the cardiac episode.  Year 11-16 (2): Wait a few days and convince your son/daughter/illegitimate son/illegitimate daughter to become a proctologist.   TIPS:  (A) If you are rich, threaten to take your progeny off of the will if they don't become a proctologist. (B) If you are medium rich, try to apply to medical school yourself. (C) If you are poor, don't go to Tommy's Joynt.  Year 20-end of story: have your family alternate between your bottom sphincter and your smooth muscle that makes BoOm BoOm PsChhh.",

Picture this, two slowly braised lamb shanks on a bed of rice or potatoes and carrots drenched in its own gravy with a roll for $8.55. Where the hell can you get a good lamb shank dinner for that price? At any other restaurant you'll be paying $20 for just one. Okay, I forgot the sides. If you add a salad/coleslaw/veggie you'll have a meal for $10-$11 tops. Yes it is a no nonsense place, but what do you expect for a tradiational German Hofbrau joint? So next time it's a t-shirt and jeans night, and you're looking to spend and little less while getting more head over to Tommy's Joynt for the Braised Lamb Shank.

The dinner came with salad, a day old french roll, and a small scoop of mashed potatoes. My wife had the roast beef with brown gravy (without the ketchup). The place is dark and dingy. Dark is OK with me but the walls looked as if they were coated with a thick coat of grease and dust. The carpet appeared very soiled and outdated like it should have been replaced many years ago. The paint was peeling off the walls in large sheets. Service was good. I would not bring visitors to San Francisco there.   My advice to Tommy's proprietor is; clean the place up. Paint and replace the carpet. Two scoops of mashed potatoes and some veggies or something besides the salad. The french roll was good, but maybe because it was Sunday it wasn't fresh.",

Because it's a cafeteria styled type of \u00a0place with a bar! So if you are waiting and you feel like you've been waiting for a long time, go grab yourself a drink and come back and order (well, have on person wait in line so you don't lose your spot)  All of our orders: 2 Thursday Specials - braised lamb shanks with vegetables Beef Stew BBQ Brisket  Great food and there was something for everyone - my boyfriend even stated that he would love to have his next birthday here and the friend said he would love to go to a birthday held here (wink wink, next birthday, here we come).",

    "review_text": "I like them a lot! i moved to San Francisco with my family almost 15 years ago, and I remember having ridden, or walked past Tommy's Joynt many times. It wasn't until years later when a friend and I were thinking about where to go to dinner and she brought up Tommy's Joynt that I actually ate there for the first time. At this point, I can confidently say that I'm a fan.  My favorite thing on the menu to get is the lamb shanks, available on Thursdays and Sundays. They are so tender, and so flavorful. The boiled potatoes that come with the meal soak up all the yummy juices from the lamb yet still have their natural potato flavor. If I'm free on a Thursday or Sunday and I have the stomach for it, I'm going to Tommy's Joynt and that's what I'm getting. Besides lamb shanks, I also like their chicken and rice, their buffalo chilli, and their turkey sloppy joes.  I only \u00a0have a couple issues with the place: The menu basically has no veggie items, so if you're bringing a group of friends, and at least one or two of them are vegetarians, you're in trouble. Additionally, their bathrooms are located upstairs, above the dining area, so if you have mobility issues, that's kind of tough. Other than hose points, I'd say if you're planning on going, be prepared to dine in a packed house 'cause that's what Tommy's Joynt is a majority of the time, especially on weekends.",

On our third date, my future wife and I decided to stop into Tommy's Joynt for a beer. We found two seats at the bar and sat down to watch a little of the Giants/Angels World Series and rooted on the Giants. This was before the infamous collapse in game six and well before my wife would learn of my sick and twisted humour and I was still on my best behavior.   As we sat and sipped our beers and exchanged tidbits of information such as \"so, where did you go college?\" and \"I'm a Capricorn\" etc etc there was a gentleman seated next to my wife who took a liking to her. He was quite the conversationalist and actually ended up talking to my wife more than me. He was drinking nasty beer and eating hard boiled eggs. As the game went on he continued to drink more and more and became more animated. During the eighth inning and a solid Giants lead he leaned over and smooched my wife on the cheek leaving a little hard boiled egg on her chin.   My wife made the wise decision to ignore the nice man the rest of the evening, but the hard boiled continued to hang off her chin. I didn't want to be rude and bring it up, but looking back I really should have said something.   5 stars for being instrumental in helping me land a spouse.",

After looking at Tommy's for years on end (its right smack in the middle of Van Ness and Geary, you can't miss it!), I finally went it there with a group of friends who highly recommended it. I walk in and see the hofbrau style menu and felt at ease. I love hofbrau style restaurants. Sometimes I just don't feel like dealing with a waiter, sometimes I just wanna grab a tray, grab my food and commence eating without all the sitting around and waiting. I ordered the BBQ beef tri tip sandwich and mashed potatoes. The tri tip was melt in your mouth tender. Seriously, you could cut it with spoon. Oftentimes I am disappointed with tri tip, because it will be tough or stringy, NOT AT THIS PLACE! I happily devoured everything on my plate. Then we started playing with the hot mustard... If you love hot mustard, you must definitely hit up Tommy's! We were dipping all kinds of stuff into it, and seeing how much we could eat before our eyes watered up and our sinuses burned. The bar is awesome, the food is AMAZING, and the atmosphere is really chill. The prices are VERY reasonable as well (a local hofbrau here in San Leandro charges far more for the same things). I highly recommend this place to all who enjoy good hearty food and a kickback place to hang out and eat!",

I went for the corn beef sandwich with a side of potato salad. The sandwich was overly simple: 1 piece of corn beef between a hard, distasteful sourdough roll, nothing else. It comes with a warm sauce you can pour or dip the sandwich into (maybe to soften the hard roll), but the sauce itself was very bland. \u00a0The corn beef may have been overcooked, as it was a bit gummy. The potato salad, however, was pretty decent. The upside of this place is the affordability, as my meal totaled to about only $9.",

The sandwiches were about $6.50 and the sides were $2.50 each. $19 total for both meals. We sat ourselves and loaded our sandwiches with horseradish and spicy mustard they have out on the tables. BE CAREFEUL-the horseradish will get you. Use sparingly, unless you want to clear your sinuses.   A waitress came to help us with drinks. We ordered a 'nutty Irishman' and a tall Paulsner Hefenweisen from Germany. I went to Munich last summer. I must say, its great. $4.50 for draft, $3.50 for bottles and $6.00 for the cocktail. The waitress was great. CASH ONLY for the bar too.   All and all, I can't wait to go back. Very casual with a rustic/tavern feel.   My recommendation: Roast Beef sandwich with Mashed potatoes. Skip the Macaroni salad. Try one of their 100 beers! They are great and from all over the world!",

Everything was great, and huge portions (especially the enchilada). The enchilada was stuffed with shredded turkey meat and topped with a sauce that reminded me more of gravy than a Mexican enchilada sauce. I think the beans were kidney beans and it also came with white rice.   My hubby loved his brisket. The BBQ sauce wasn't your typical BBQ, but was a thinner and more tangy sauce.

It's got a really high fat content, but I'm one of those people who enjoys the fat as much as the meat. The sauce it was drenched it was slightly sweet, and really made the dish perfect. We also ordered a dinner plate of BBQ beef brisket with a side of mashed potatoes, all soaked in the best BBQ sauce I've tasted in a very long time. It's almost unbelievable how tender the brisket was. It was literally falling apart like shredded beef. To top it off, they slice it from a huge hunk of meat right in front of you. They definitely don't skimp on anything here. My mashed potatoes were heavenly. The best ones I've had that weren't made in my own home. Really fluffy, yet starchy.

I recommend the BBQ Beef sandwiches, but I was looking at their daily specials menu and it looked pretty bomb.

    "review_text": "Another classic joint in the city; I don't know how many times I've passed by Tommy's and just gave it a quick glance. I didn't think too much of it for awhile, mainly because I wasn't sure if I could venture into the place by myself.   So, last week, I came here finally, TWICE, with my younger brother. He had heard about Tommy's Joynt from the Food Network, and he was lucky that I knew the location of the place so well (he just threw out the question, \"Do you know where Tommy's Joynt is?\" since we were hungry and I guess his curiosity got the best of him). We came here first on a Tuesday, around 5 or so.   When we walked in, we were a bit confused about how to order, or if we were to be seated by someone or not. I think we might have stood at the entrance for a good five minutes trying to understand the concept of the place (and also trying to get our bearings with the menu, which is splattered all over the wall in colorful signs); finally, my brother asked the man behind the counter, \"Uh, do we seat ourselves, or....?\" and the guy smiled and replied, \"You order right here.\"  We were indeed lucky that nobody else was waiting behind us; my brother asked the guy for a recommendation since I assume he felt overwhelmed with all the choices. The menu is indeed a meat-lover's heaven and a vegetarian's hell: meat, meat, everywhere. Daily specials are posted, although you can order these specials any day of the week as well (with the same price, I think). There's an abundance of sandwiches, classic entrees such as buffalo stew, turkey leg, and chili. Everything is under $10, which is a real steal! You could come here and eat dinner for less than $10; the bar is extensive as well with all kinds of drinks.   There are also salads, although they're more or less the less-healthy kind. The only menu item that seems a little over-priced is dessert: there are only four items (apple pie, carrot cake, cheesecake, chocolate cake), and they're all store-bought cake. $2.75 for a slice; not really a deal considering the slices aren't huge like the entrees. You're better off skipping the dessert here; focus on the entrees themselves!  My brother went with pasta dishes both times, once with braised oxtails, the other time with meatballs. I went with a knockwurst sandwich the first time around; on Wednesday, I tried the broiled ground chuck steak sandwich (the special for the day). Both meals were very filling; surprisingly, the food wasn't overly greasy. Ordering at the front counter was an experience in itself: they carve the meat fresh in front of you and show you how they prepare it all. It's a feast for the eyes indeed.  My brother loved his meals so much that he took home extra food both times we were there. It's not food that I eat much of these days, but I wouldn't mind coming to Tommy's for cheap and good food from time to time.   A small aside: the bathrooms are located strangely on the top floor. Follow the signs (like a treasure hunt!), go up the stairs, and ladies, be careful of the way the second floor seems to funnel into the men's bathroom by default; the ladies' room is located on the other side of the stall (you'll see what I mean when you come here).  The decor emits a long-gone era with the various memorabilia on the walls. Some may find the decor appalling/distracting, but it gives me a sense of strange nostalgia. I'm not even that old, but it's nice to see a classic place like this still standing around.   Cash only, so be sure to withdraw some money at your bank's ATM before you treat yourself to some food at Tommy's.",

As much as I like dining with crisp white linens savoring on foie gras and wagyu capped off with a souffle, sometimes I crave something cheap, simple and down home. Tommy's totally delivers on this front.   I've avoided coming back to Tommy's for the longest time (almost 3 years) and as soon as arrived this past Tuesday, the same man who works behind counter said, \"Whoa! I use to see you every Saturday night...2 spare rib dinners; one with sauce and one without.\" I didn't need to be reminded, but I was surprised that he even remembered me especially with the sheer volume of people that come in/out here everyday. This man (with a black mustache) has always been so nice and always wears a warm smile around his face, so I'm dedicating this updated review to him.   If you don't like meat, steer far away from Tommy's. It's a Carniwhore's Dream: Roast Chicken, Jumbo Turkey Legs, Buffalo Stew, Corned Beef, Brisket, Roast Beef, Pastrami, Spare Ribs, Oxtail, Lamb Shank, etc. There are static daily specials but being a loyal customer (now a return customer) for almost 7 years, my ultimate favs are the following:  *BRAISED OXTAILS (Monday Special): Three hunks of fall-off-the bone oxtails that are so soft that it literally melts in your mouth. As much as I love Chinese oxtails, Tommy's got 'em beat!  *BEEF SHORT RIBS (Tuesday Special): A thick cut of rib with meat so tender that it flakes off with your fork.   *BBQ SPARE RIBS (Saturday Special): Thick, fatty cuts of spare ribs with succulently juicy meat with a tangy and subtle smokiness.   (Please note: Consistency in meat texture varies, so go during peak times when there is a quicker turnaround with the meat and hot trays.)  I always opt to get the rice pilaf instead of the pasta because the rice soaks up all the rich, savory sauce making each bite ohhh, so comforting. Make sure to say, \"YES, to the bread!\" The sourdough roll is crusty with a great toothsome chew and with soft, pillowly center. It's SO good that it rivals most of the breads served at fine dining restaurants.   Everything is under $11 and portions are MASSIVE (enough for two meals). And they say, I'm not a cheap date? PSHHHHH!  P.S. - If you want a second date, I would advise avoiding Tommy's until later dates. Unless you want to test a gold-digger that is, than by all means...",

The fabled Tommy's Joynt has been around since the late 1940s. Apparently, it was a pretty poppin' spot to hit up after performances at the opera house down the street, as well as other live theater productions in the 'hood. It's cool to see that through the many faces this city has seen, it's still rockin' there on Van Ness like it was 60 years ago.  It almost seems too good to be true, but they're open until 2:00am every night, carving fresh meats for hungry passersby. You can grind on anything from sandwiches to full on dinners for less than $9. If you're really hungry, grab a dinner plate with turkey, stuffing, mashed taters, gravy and a slice of bread. Or if you're swooping up a quick bite to go, nosh on a sandwich as you walk out the door to catch a bus or hop into a cab.   Occasionally, the meats will be a little dry... but I suppose you could opt for a shitty 7-Eleven sandwich that's been sitting in plastic wrap for 26 hours if you're concerned about moistness. Personally, I'll take a dry piece of turkey over an expired egg salad sandwich any day.  They were featured on some Travel Channel show recently (Diners, Drive-Ins', &amp; Dives, I believe)... so it's pretty dope to see an old school operation like theirs in the national spotlight.",

The food, as others have mentioned, is just cafeteria food, so calling Tommy's Joint a \"restaurant\" is a stretch. \u00a0If you don't expect too much, you shouldn't be disappointed. \u00a0The food is relatively cheap and filling and reasonably good considering the format. \u00a0Add a unique beer and you'll have a fine time, especially if you share a table near some out-of-towners who are there because they saw an ad for Tommy's Joint in a tourist mag or just happened to be walking by. \u00a0  But don't be deceived. While Tommy's Joint is an SF \"institution\" (opened in 1947 a few years before I was born), it is NOT all that. \u00a0It's just a cafeteria with a little panache and, if you keep that in context, you'll have a fine time there, but don't go overboard and give it a better rating than it really deserves just because it's \"different.\"",

If you're like me, you don't carry cash very often, but on the off chance I do, I come here.   This place is open super late, I dare say 24 hours, I can't tell. I'm usually too drunk from the bars when I arrive that I don't know what time it is. The food is real good. It's not perfect because it's been sitting for a bit but it gets the job done. You either get pastrami, roast beef or brisket. Ya heard? Get one of those with a side of mashed potatoes and something else and you got yourself a hearty, meaty, hot meal. They got fruit salad and veggies and other sides, etc etc. That's not important. What is important is the meat. Brisket is cooked very well and the potatoes were perfect with the gravy.  Do note that this is a quick way to get some decent grub. The food will not be perfect. I'm sure a lot of reviews are skewed by lots of drunk people coming after hours and if you are in that mindset, this is the greatest thing ever. If you aren't, it's okay depending on how fresh the food is when you arrive. It's a crapshoot. So the food is good and I am a fan but temper expectations a little. Not many places will give you pastrami for under $10 after midnight. The bar is also cash only. Go drink elsewhere and come here for after hour munchies.",

I swore I'd never come back not because the food or service was bad but the last time I ate at Tommy's I saw a big grey hairy cat running around the back of the dining room. When I mentioned this to the staff they laughed because it belonged to a customer who seemed to be a regular. That was enough for me to say, \"Never again\". That was then, this is now. My friend Don wanted to have lunch at Tommy's so I decided why not? That fat grey cat is probably not around any more???  Showed up at 1p on a Sunday, most of the tables were taken and hardly any line to order food. The Brisket was calling me, about 5 generous slices and about 5 smaller slices were put on my plate with a choice of baked beans or salad, bread roll and butter, mashed potato and I asked for the bbq sauce to be served on the side; for $9.50 with tax that was a good price.   I settled in at a table for two at the back where it was quiet and dug in. The Brisket was cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful, beans were nice and I could have used a bit more mashed potato. The bread roll was a hard white roll, I prefer whole wheat. I asked for the bbq sauce on the side because I didn't want to mask the taste of the brisket with the sauce and I wanted to see if the brisket and sauce could hold their own. I poured a bit of the sauce on the plate, it seemed watery but tasted nice, not too tart or sweet. When I tried it with the brisket I was pleased with how it enhanced the brisket flavor and didn't just cover it up; I think it's safe to say they each held \u00a0their own.  I liked the idea of having a drink waitress to avoid getting in another line at the bar. The bar has many beer selections and any bar that serves a good pulled guiness has my vote!  I'm Glad Tommy's is still serving up good food and I'll definitely be back.  That fat cat was no where to be seen!",

The pastrami was cut thick so it has great texture. But there's too much fat in our meat. The portion for lamb shank is very generous - 2 shanks in one order! It's nice and tender but kinda too salty to my taste. Overall, I'm glad I've come here to check out this institution. But maybe once is enough.",

Perfectly going with you sandwich.  I ordered a side just on a whim (cole slaw) and it was mmm mmm good. The bar seemed pretty cool. I almost would like to hang out here on a weekend night but I don't know what the vibe is like (more restaurant-y or bar-y) at night.

Way Less Potatos A dinner plate used to net you a hearty mound of mashed potatos but the most recent visit was about a tablespoon full and then they drenched it with turnkey gravy even though i asked them not to.   Corned Beef Again, tastes like the meat is not from the same source as in the past  Beef Brisket Was dry and overdone  If i can think of one thing positive to say it is regarding: Price is still reasonable but I think an increase at this time would be nothing short of an insult.

The potato salad was average. The macoroni salad was nasty and had a weird taste to it. I wouldnt mind coming back here to try other meats, but it's not my first choice to come back.",

Overall, I don't know where people get \"world famous\" or \"the original\" from. There is nothing original about this place. The pastrami sandwich I ordered was ridiculously plain. The meat was scarce, and somewhat seasoned. The bread was cold and hard. My gf ordered a brisket place and it came with mashed potatoes and gravy, a bread roll, and baked beans. The bread roll was so hard I had to break it myself. The baked beans were literally out-of-the-can quality. The brisket was somewhat tough and not too much flavor to it. The mashed potatoes...good god. The boxed Betty Crocker mashed potatoes are probably loads better than this.  I am assuming anyone who gave this place more than 3 stars was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs. Any person with any sense of fresh, high quality food would tell you there is nothing that comes with this place. It does have good value (in san francisco standards), but the best thing I can put it is the following:  I was so miserable with my small, almost meatless sandwich I went to Walgreens and bought a similar \"Italian sub\" sandwich for $3.99. The Walgreens sandwich had a better bun and almost the same amount of meat. Overall, the Walgreen's sandwich was more edible.   Truly disappointed.",

I never understood how a place can serve \"canned vegetable\" and instant mashed potatoes\" and get by with it, when there are so many other great options for the price in SF. The meat options that my co-hort (a many time return patron from out of town) noticed the decline of quality as well, as his meat (3 items) as well as mine were all dry and some were even grisly and tough. I had brisket, which had a brown gravy that was nastily sweet and unappetizing. The worst part of the experience, is that now there are no wait staff to ask you if you want anything to drink, and not realizing this, we finished half our meal and had to ask the food preparers if anyone was going to be coming by to take our drink requests, and they said \"you have to order from the bar\", which I never had to do during previous visits since they used to have staff that came by periodically to check on you. All in all, it was not a very pleasant experience for the money and you definitely can get more value and service elsewhere.",

But, since I rarely ever get to the Bay Area, I didn't give it much thought after that.  Well, I happened to be in San Fran for 2 days &amp; 1 night, and of course, always looking for good food! While searching Yelp for some ideas, I saw the high reviews for Tommy's and took a closer look. As I read the description further, I realized that this was the place on Triple D, and it was literally just across the street from my hotel. I had to check it out, and was glad I did.  I had the fresh carved pastrami on rye, with a side of cole slaw; $8.65 + tip/tax. It was a nice portion of meat, which was tender and flavorful. Add the hot mustard at the table, throw some of the slaw on the sandwich, and it's a great meal. They also have a great draft micro beer selection, and full bar.  There were many other things on the menu that I'd like to try if I ever get back...and I will.  Sure the place is old, and the line to place an order looks like the line for an amusement park ride, but they move fast and the food is good.

It's like a cafeteria that serves dried out chunks of meat served with a ladle of gravy. I felt grossed out eating anything from here. You can say I don't appreciate the \"uniqueness\" of this place, but please remember that \"uniqueness\" is not always good.   My bf wanted white people food and made me come here. As soon as I walked in I knew what I was walking into and I was NOT happy. But I gave it a try hoping that the food was better than everything else about this place and the verdict? It was just as bad if not worst. I couldn't \u00a0even eat anything on my plate after a couple bites because it was just so disgusting. The only thing that I managed to eat was the green salad with ranch and I spend $18+ for both of our meals. \u00a0So technically you can say it was the most expensive godddd damn salad ever.  My bf ended up eating his and mine plate because he knew this was his bad idea and he didn't want me to be mad at him.

I just got drunk because I had 1 beer on a practically empty stomach and stumbled my way out of here.   The final judgement:  They do deserve two stars because they have a large selection of beer and it's a good price. And I guess they are kind of a landmark in SF, but the food here is just EWWWWWW.....that's the only word that comes to mind when I describe this place.  Don't believe everyone else when they tell you how good stuff is, it's really not good at all. Prices are cheap, that's their motto but I think it's still over priced for the quality of what they are serving you.   ewww ewww ewww......",

This was one of our stops, like a lot of people we saw this on the food network so we decided to go in and try the food.   The food was ok. I got the turkey dinner my husband got the pastrami. The prices were not bad since we were on a budget. The guys serving the food were friendly and making us laugh. That's why I gave this place 3 stars and I was generous.  Now for the bad. The cashier (old man) had an attitude on him and wouldn't even look at us till he was done counting his quarters. The food got cold quick, and seating was limited but we didn't mind that too much. The one that pissed us off the most, there was a waitress/hostess walking around being friendly and asking everyone around us \"How's everything, can I get you anything?\" but us. She acknowledged people that got there before us and after us, but acted like we were not there. She brought people waters and beer and we had to get up and walk all the way to the front and get our own. Really? If you don't like your job, find another one. Last con the bathrooms, I understand it's an old building and things are done a certain way. But after hiking up these San Francisco streets the last thing you want to do is hike up a narrow flight of old wooden stairs to wait 10 minutes for some lady to get out of the one toilet restroom the got.  Would I go back, Hell no, didn't like the treatment and for ok food I rather just go to a fast food joint.",

    "review_text": "Came here today hoping that the food would have gotten better from the last time I was here (about two years ago). \u00a0The last time, I got the corned beef and cabbage with potatoes. \u00a0Back then, the corned beef was very dry and salty and the potatoes were dry and bland. Also, the customer service we received that time was bad because after we told the server that we would not be ordering anything from the bar, they never came back by our table at all for the rest of our meal. \u00a0  So, today, I decided to go back and give Tommy's Joynt another try (mostly because a co-worker of mine was particularly impressed with Tommy's Joynt, after having had a meal there about six months ago. So, we got there and decided to order lunch to go, because the place was actually kinda crowded (go figure?) and parking was hard to find. \u00a0I ordered spaghetti and meatballs because I thought it would be a pretty safe choice. \u00a0How bad could a place screw up spaghetti? \u00a0Apparently alot... \u00a0The spaghetti noodles were mushy and the sauce was strangely orange and thick, like it was made with carrots and then thickened with flour to make it go further. The sauce was more like the consistency of gravy - \u00a0no taste of tomatoes, no taste of carrots (oddly), no taste at all really. \u00a0Kinda reminded me of baby food. \u00a0The meatballs were seasoned well enough I guess (at least I could taste salt, pepper, maybe some garlic), but when I bit into them they were dark pink in the middle, like they weren't cooked enough. \u00a0 \u00a0  For the side dish, I had the asparagus salad, which had an unexpected taste. \u00a0I think they flavored it with tahini, because it had a strong sesame flavor and reminded me of hummus. \u00a0It could have been alot tastier, but it seemed like it was just thrown together and so it was just kind of blah. \u00a0  The only thing that actually tasted good was the plain cheesecake that I ordered for dessert. \u00a0It was very uniform in appearance, so I'm thinking that it was probably commercially prepared, not by Tommy's Joynt.  I finished all of the dessert, but sadly, wound up throwing most of the rest of my lunch away. \u00a0Damn, I hate wasting money. \u00a0Normally, if a meal was at least decent tasting, I'd take it home and have another meal from it, rather than waste it. \u00a0Or, at the very least, if I didn't like it that well, I'd give it to one of the dogs in the building. But, I just couldn't see myself eating anymore of it and didn't want to be charged with \"animal cruelty\", so in the garbage it went. \u00a0  Now, I am just totally confused with the other good reviews of this place, especially from the other Yelpers who had the spaghetti and actually liked it. What is wrong with you people? \u00a0There was a time, long ago, when Tommy's Joynt gave huge portions of tender and tasty cuts of meat. \u00a0I believe those days are gone and not likely to come back. All of you Yelpers (who gave Tommy's Joynt such a high rating) will have to do a whole lot to try to convince me to give this place yet another try, after today's dismal experience...",

Second of all, mommy only knows how to re heat what grandma makes, so unless they change it to \"Just what Mommy lola (lola is tagalog for grandma btw) used to make then no nostalgia will be achieved. You lie, Tommy's.   Second of all, now that we've established Tommy's is a liar, we can now conclude the food ain't all that either. Master (ultimate food connoisseur) is freaking in love with this place and I am never one to question his prodigious tongue (wink,loljk), he once told me \"I can't get enough of this restaurant, I could eat here everyday and never get sick of it, if it was a woman...it'd be you\" awww, of course I felt obligated to love the restaurant version of myself. Pfffft, no. One sentence: Everything is fucking dry as shit. Oh, and I've had everything believe you me! (I was forced to come here three times a week for several months, I'm pretty sure I had everything) I've had the sandwiches because I initially started off only ordering sandwiches then I thought ok if the sandwiches suck I should get their specialty, nope, that didn't work either. Mind you that includes the fucking apple pie and if the apple pie is that unsatisfying let me tell you I'm never trying the fucking chocolate cake or carrot cake, sandpaper scraping my tongue will go down easier. AND DON'T DENY IT, if it's not dry it's because it's completely drenched in it's agreeable sauces. THIS BETTER NOT BE WHAT MASTER MEANT WHEN HE SAID THE RESTAURANT WAS ME, I AM FAR FROM DRY---DAMNIT.   Each time I've been here I've taken one bite and took the rest to go because I need the help of some Mary Jane to perform magic tricks and make it disappear in 2 spoonfuls.   That's not entirely true, I will tell you there are three things that save this place from ruin.  -Decoration: AUTOGRAPHED PICTURE FROM METALLICA, just one of the many highlights they have covering every inch of every wall and ceiling, upstairs and downstairs! I do fancy an invariable rusticated atmosphere every now and then. The bathroom sells sex toys .50 too! I think the conversation went like this : \"MASTER GIVE ME FOUR QUARTERS YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT KINDA VENDING MACHINES THEY GOT!!!!\" =) I spent a dollar and got two things, cute but nothing I utilized in the bedroom that night.  - Cheap STRONG, generously poured alcohol. Oh God bless, God bless! The hot buttered rum is what I imagined the butter beer in Harry Potter to taste like, and the cheap cheap AMF! 95% Adios 5% sprite, $8.00 but it's served in a pine glass on droids. Iono though, something isn't right, I'm a featherweight and usually get drunk and stay drunk especially with drinks this perceivably strong but I sobered up within half an hour. Drunk sex after this place never happens.   - Ok, I lied, the lamb shank is fucking amazing it's the only thing that isn't dry and the roast beef has potential for magnificence, provided you let it sit for ten minutes in it's marinade, and I never had anything bad to say about the damn good potatoes or bread, I always wish they'd give us a whole basket of those little sourdough pieces of heaven so I could let them absorb the sauce like a sponge and just devour them. MMMMMMMM  The real rating is 3 stars, I gave it 4 because I'm being biased, it's the love of my lifes love of his life, and I love what he loves and coming here with him makes the dry roast beef worth swallowing. It takes swallowing pride to a whole new level don't it ?  If I am no longer writing Yelp reviews after this, master has probably read this and buried my body in barbados for talking shit about his ALL TIME FAVORITE RESTAURANT !",

They have all sorts of items up on the wall and the tables and booths are set up in a community setting. Menu is relatively simple with a daily special and everything is pre-made sitting in steamed metal pans so you can see how it looks. I had an order of their lamb shank and beef brisket.

Others in our group had the pastrami, the lamb shanks, and meatball sub. Everyone agreed it's just plain good food. Not fancy, but food like you'd cook at home (if you're from the Midwest where meat is king and portions are big) The atmosphere is unpretentious. And the folks there are just plain nice! Not overbearing, not over-solicitious, but helpful, available, and dang if there weren't always smiling whenever we were there. We'll be back!",

Anyway, I got some meatballs on some creamy mashed potatoes and my friend got a pastrami sandwich. \u00a0Conversation ceased as we ate and ate and ate. \u00a0  The really cool thing about Tommy's is the cheap buzz, drinks are unbelievably inexpensive, even a Long Island Iced Tea was only $6.50. \u00a0I got a margarita for $5.00 and was woozy after drinking only half. \u00a0Strong like you would not believe.

After driving past this place countless times, I'm glad I finally went in one day after a party in Civic Center Plaza. Sometimes it's late, and I don't want diner food from the Grubstake, or pizza for Seniore's, or Korean from Arang, or a burger from Nations, and that is when I come here. No culinary genius here, just good and reliable grub.  When you walk in, you feel like you've entered another world, or gone back in time. The decor is cluttered and is total sensory overload, but it has some rustic charm to it. A San Francisco classic.",

This place has been here forever.. ok, since 1947 anyways! we both had the BBQ Beef Sandwich on a sour roll. It was filling but it was a lot of bread. I would have liked more meat, the sauce served in the little ceramic pitcher was good but sticky! One of those little pkg'd wipes would have been nice. I used an ice cube from my daughters soda &amp; a napkin! She had a salad with Italian dressing. She didn;t like the dressing but I did. It had a strong balsamic vinegar flavor. I had the mixed veggie salad. It was ok. I wish I had looked closer and realized they had pickled beets! Bummer for me.. I did not know their pickles were home made!! I didn;t get any!  One reason for not looking closer is if you haven;t been in here before or in a while, it is kind of overwhelming. The \"menu\" is on various boards and signs behind the counter. Kind of hard to take it all in. I guess there are paper menus but I didn;t see them and the guy behind the counter just pointed behind him when i asked about a menu.  Good bar service.  It was fun to see the window open and the underground kitchen in the back! Cooks handing out big pans of meats from down below!  I ordered some of their \"famous\" buffalo stew over rice to go. Having that tomorrow for lunch. I'll post my review on that once I eat it... taking into account that is from the day before.  CASH ONLY with an ATM machine right in the restaurant for you! How nice.. for them. I'm not a big fan of cash only but a conveniently located, additional fee, ATM strategically placed.  Walk in, order at the counter, they dish it up, pay, then sit down and someone will come take your drink order. I know when I went there a long time ago, we ordered from menus at the table. It would \u00a0be nicer that way. I kind of felt rushed to order and didn;t feel I was seeing everything available.. tho no one rushed us at all. I just felt that way  6/20/07: I warmed up the buffalo stew and it wasn't very good the next day. Kind of dry, how buffalo can be.. but maybe it would have been a lot better if eaten right away. Before the rice soaked up the liquid. It definitely looked really good. Maybe if taking to go, ask for the rice separate.  3/1/08: My daughter has since had their Buffalo Stew hot and it was delicious! Oh and those PICKLES!! They may be the best part of the meal! Love eating there because we can eat platefuls of them!!!",

I love the bean salad but had to trade it for the brussels which had the same vinaigrette. i'm sure it was a fluke and just my taste buds. my man's bbq beef was amazeballz. and per usual the mashed potatoes were on point. love this place.",

    "review_text": "People seem to love this place, and once upon a time I did too, but it's not that great of a value and the food is incredibly low quality. \u00a0The reason it's cheap is because the meat is processed, the veggies are canned, the salad dressings come out of a plastic tub, the sausages are probably not even really even mostly meat now, you get the picture...  I've tried a lot of food here over the years, and it doesn't rate higher than prepared food or frozen food from Safeway. \u00a0If the food at the movie theatre across the street wasn't so expensive, I'd probably opt for their crappy pizzas or chicken tenders over Tommy's when going out for a movie. \u00a0I'd get Mel's over them as well, but quick counter ordering at Tommy's is great, and you can have a drink while you're in line.  The people that work here have been working here forever, and basically no one is customer service oriented. \u00a0They're all pretty unpleasant to interact with and don't seem to care that much about their jobs. \u00a0The restaurant itself is just so dirty and has a strange smell to it. \u00a0This place needs a spring cleaning.  I don't find much motivation to come back here anymore. \u00a0It used to be fun and special to me, but it is just fading with the times, losing quality, and now losing my business. \u00a0I'll stop by for a cheap drink before a movie, but that's it.",

There really isn't missing Tommy's Joynt, it's at the corner of Geary and VanNess and stands out like a sore thumb. Their specialties are hot homemade dinners and hand carved sandwiches. The place works cafeteria style as you order by the counter, slide your way down to the cashier to pay, then carry your meal to a table and enjoy. Make sure to stop by the barrel of free sliced pickles on your way to your seat. In addition to the regular menu they also have a special meal each day of the week (that's the same every week). They also have an extremely long bar with the most impressive beer list I've seen in awhile.  Living in NYC and visiting the west coast for the first time I had to try their pastrami. I can certainly appreciate that they homemake all their meats and that they hand carve the sandwiches instead of slice them but there just wasn't any comparing to Katz. The sandwich wasn't that big and the meat wasn't as juicy as I'm used to. What saved them was that they gave me a cup of hot au jus that made every bite I dipped in it amazing. It was too bad the cup wasn't wide enough to really fit the sandwich in it and I didn't want to make a mess by pouring it over everything.  After re-watching Guy Fieri at Tommy's Joynt I realized that getting a plate (not a sandwich) is definitely the way to go here. You get a nice large portion, a side, and some sort of gravy or sauce to keep everything nice and moist. I think getting some hand sliced turkey with gravy would have been great. So although it wasn't the best pastrami I've ever had I still enjoy the food and the set up at Tommy's and highly recommend checking it out.",

This is one of those instances. Why, Yelpers? WHY?! (But it's okay Yelp, I still love you!)  I ordered the Beef Brisket, expecting it be melt-in-your-mouth good from previous reviews. Um, no. In fact, it was crumble-in-your-mouth-BAD. The beef tasted like it was severely over-boiled and lacked that juicy flavor. So disappointing.  Their lack of decent presentation definitely didn't help the situation. They serve you your meal in a prison-like cafeteria tray. I am a big believer in the importance of presentation because it makes the food taste better.   I wanted to stop eating the moment I took that first bite, but since I felt bad wasting food, I finished most of my plate. The only reason I was able to eat most of it was that I ate it with the delicious horseradish sauce that was on the table. YUM. Now, THAT deserves an extra star alone. But still not enough to drag me back to this place.  I would highly, highly recommend against coming here. If you're craving very good beef, I'd suggest House of Prime Rib. Of course, it's much more expensive but well worth the money.",

They surely give a lot of meat but i prefer my sandwich to have some toppings and they didn't seem to have any there. The server's aren't friendly either. Overall if you want just bread and meat for 8 bucks then go here. Else go over to bite on sutter and leavenworth, their sandwiches are much better than here.",

I ended up finding a table in the back (up a set of stairs) that was half-pushed out of the way.  If it wasn't for the seating issues, I would probably go back to eat.

What you walk into is a dimly lit place with beer inspired decor covering the walls. Look to the left, a full bar...nice. A sign with the daily specials hangs above the food line. Cafeteria style hof brau, I can dig it. While waiting in line, I read Yelp reviews to help make my decision. I read the braised lamb shanks were good. I look up at the sign, it's Thursday, lamb shanks day. Perfect. I told my friend about the reviews and before I could spit out I'm ordering the lamb shanks, this guy blurts out he's getting it. Grrr, I hate ordering the same thing, especially when it's my first time somewhere.  I opt for the bbq brisket of beef. The server grabs a big hunk of brisket, cuts 6 slices, adds a scoop of mashed potatoes to the plate and puts it on a tray. I got the accompanying sauce on the side. Along with the entree came a choice of salads, coleslaw please. Friend's tray consisted of a plate with 2 shanks, carrots and potatoes in a stew-like sauce. Friend didn't want a dinner roll, I do. Friend changes mind...copy cat. Friend: Can I get a roll too? Server: You said you didn't want one. Friend: Yeah but I changed my mind. Server: I asked you but you didn't want one. Friend: Well, can I get one? Server: Rolls eyes and plops a roll on a plate.  Haha, wtf? That was way too much conversing for a roll.   Dinner came to $19 and change (thanks for treating, dinner buddy!). A good price for 2 big, hearty meals. We take said trays and find a table adorned with a checkered covered vinyl tablecloth. Along with a napkin dispenser, atop the table were 2 types of mustards (hot and mild) and horseradish. Water is self-serve. At first, you will see a white appearance to it. I was assured by a worker that it was just the water pressure and sure enough, the water quickly became clear. Any pickle fans? Well, next to the water is a big container of free pickles...only take what you can consume (one of my dad's favorite saying when I was growing up).  My meal was straight comfort food...hearty and very filling. The beef was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it. However, it didn't have much seasoning. It definitely needed some type of sauce or S&amp;P to add flavoring. The mash was made with real potatoes (no flakes) and it had a nice, smooth consistency. The sauce I had on the side kind of confused me. Sweet, tangy but it had more of a consistency to gravy. Whatever, a fork full of meat and mash dipped simultaneously into the sauce solved any confusion. It was good but I've had better. Props to how the meat was cooked because brisket, I hear, is the hardest type of meat to bbq.  The lamb shanks was the better choice of meals. The meat was tender and succulent. When the meat falls off the bone, it's usually a good sign. The sauce was very flavorful, not being overly salty.  If I happen to run into this place again, that's fine with me. If it was my choice, I'd go elsewhere as there are many other restos in the area to choose from.",

What further perplexes me is that since this place is a cafeteria sytle(served) eatery and at the same time its not that cheap. Not really. Same line as The Hoffbrau. Although the Hoffbrau is a tad bit better than this place, but not by much. Anyways, Tommy's is that old school SF hangout and the clientle is probably decsendants of the past. And they don't care to pay top dollar for cheap food.  This round was my third one in purchasing the leg of lamb with side salad and bread&amp;butter. Total cost with tax is a whopping $14.03 and that was a mistake on the order cook as I had previously asked him to serve me the special of the day and he apparently confused it with the \"house special\"-which was/is the lamb shank. The special at the time was beef tips with rice pillaf and was priced at upper $8bux or so. That would have been the cheaper meal as I prolly would have been charged around $10bux out the door. Much cheaper than what I ended up eating and paid. And yes, the rub in this one is that the lamb shank was overcooked and not meaty at all. If anything, that lamb piece I got was anorexic and at $14bux, you get ONE piece? And so yeah, Tommy's relies on business from tourists and local city drunks that don't care for taste and care more for quantity and not quality. The side salad is always drenched in dressing. Should order the dressing on the side.",

It's cooked so tender, fall off the bone good, drenched in an amazing sweet oily sauce that's like crack. *wipes drool off face* I usually get the pasta with it and use the bread roll they give you and dip it in the oh-so-good sweet sauce. It's a little on the sweet side, so if you're looking for something savory, go with the beef brisket instead (which is cut when you order and cooked medium-rareish usually).  The lamb is awesome too! You get 2 small lamb shanks in a savory gravy sauce. Very tender and I just love the gamy taste of lamb. Other dishes I've tried are the turkey leg (okay) and the buffalo stew (very, very salty when I had it and a bit dry and too chunky).  This is a very casual place that's cafeteria style, but there's a cocktail server that comes around to take your drink orders. They have a million beers to choose from and a full bar if beer is not your thing. The place gets a little crowded during dinner time and it's a good place to watch the game.   Staff is friendly, but the cocktail servers can be a little spotty depending on who. Some have forgotten our drinks altogether and some are super nice. Pricing is very decent. Get a full meal that'll fill you up for $10. If you're a meat lover, you MUST try this place!",

Well, today, a co-worker told me that we were going here for lunch. \u00a0I complied.  To Order: BBQ Brisket of Beef Sandwich (w/ mayo and mustard) --WHAT an order. \u00a0At under $6, it was definitely a good price for the quality of food. \u00a0The brisket was perfect. \u00a0The gobs of fat were sliced off by someone who looked like a butcher, leaving behind the flavorful portions of meat and sparse shreds of fat. \u00a0I enjoyed every single bite. Turkey Leg w/ Stuffing and Green Beans --At under $6 for this meal as well, I couldn't get over what a STEAL it was. \u00a0Ever been to a theme park and ordered the giant turkey legs? \u00a0Well, this was one of them. \u00a0GREAT taste, large portions, and eye-catching (especially when you open it up and your co-workers are sitting around... jealous as hell). \u00a0  The folks behind the counter were friendly, giving us smiles the entire time. \u00a0The atmosphere seemed very friendly and upbeat. \u00a0I felt like I could sit in there amongst friends for hours and still feel like I'm in a fun-filled environment. \u00a0Maybe I'll make this happen for sometime in the future. \u00a0This spot definitely warrants at least a second visit.  5 Stars for wonderful food and GREAT prices.

The menu here is essentially meat, bread, and a few vegetable sides. \u00a0In other words, a lot like a BBQ joint except there's not much BBQ flavor, more like a stew and dinner roast type of thing. \u00a0I had the buffalo sandwich, which was basically a buffalo stew ladled over some pieces of bread. \u00a0Simple, steamy and filling. \u00a0It was lacking in spice but there were several types of mustard and horseradish at the table to give it some kick. \u00a0The other big thing on the menu here is the beer--there's a very large selection of bottled German stuff.  The atmosphere, with the long shared tables, red and white checkered tablecloths and gold rush memorabilia, is sort of a cross between a German beer hall and a drastically more authentic version of Claim Jumper's. \u00a0All in all, not a bad place to warm your bones and fill your belly, and for a good price, too.",

I must say they do have quite a bit of options, which is good but is also confusing. You stand in line and order your food from the windows - very cafeteria style. I guess the people there are so use to working quickly because they talked so fast I had no idea what they were saying. I just kinda nodded and went \"uh-huh\". I felt rushed and I had so many questions since I wasn't sure what to order so I don't feel like I made the best possible selection for my meal.   I ordered the Corned Beef dinner plate with mashed potatoes, a mixed green salad, and also came with bread and butter. The bread was waaayyy too hard. I tried to bite into it and the damn thing hurt my front teeth. I ended up digging a hole in it and just eating the soft center. The bread was not that good. The mixed green salad may have been alright had he not drenched my salad in thousand island dressing. Seriously, I was trying to have a nice healthy salad to offset the rest of my meal and instead felt like i was drinking salad dressing. The mashed potatoes were decent although the one scoop was pretty tiny. \u00a0The corned beef was a nice portion but a bit salty. The first few bites were okay but if you ate too much, the saltiness became too much. My friend ordered the half chicken with rice. The chicken was a big portion and was pretty juicy and fell right off the bone. The rice was not enough. You pretty much only had a chicken plate.   Would I recommend this place to a friend? Hmmm not really. I guess it's one of those places worth trying just to say you have been there and know what it's about. And I'd probably come back for a quick fix that will hit the spot if I were to be in the neighborhood, but it is not a place I would go out of my way to make a special trip for. I think the quality and service is lacking. But I guess that is the norm for this type of establishment.",

It reminded me of a not-so-spicy Cincinnati-style chili (which, in case you didn't know, they serve on spaghetti). It was a heck of a lot more meaty than it was tomato-y.  My partner's turkey sloppy joe was apparently good (I don't like sloppy joe, so I didn't try it) and her mashed potatoes were good (but again, tasted like meat).

There are few things in San Francisco that haven't changed since I was a kid and this is one of them. A strict meat and potatoes establishment that never tries to reinvent itself or add any pretense to it's decor/menu. The daily specials have stayed the same since forever and when I was especially broke the turkey sloppy joe sandwich with extra gravy and mashed potatoes (under $5) is a true working man's meal.

Some friends and I wanted to grab a quick dinner before heading to the theaters and the only other real option was Mel's (meh!) so we walked across the street into Tommy's Joynt (with the crazy murals and flags).  We walked in and oh my goodness, is this place CRAZY or what?! It has so much character and was not at all what I was expecting. In addition, the food they serve definitely brought me back to the south for a quick second, especially the way they serve it cafeteria-style. There was a pretty hefty line when we got there, but it went through fairly quickly. Also they ONLY TAKE CASH (but ATM is available inside).  My friend and I both ordered the BBQ Brisket Dinner Plate and my other friend got the Buffalo Chili with rice.  BBQ Brisket Dinner Plate - comes with some hefty slices of brisket smothered in BBQ sauce, choice of green beans or mashed potatoes, choice of salad or baked beans, and a sourdough roll. The BBQ sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking, but they had horseradish, hot mustard, hot sauce, the works to bring in the kick that I wanted. The horseradish was crazy! it definitely cleared all three of our sinuses! Green beans were just fine, can't really mess them up, and the baked beans, again on the sweeter side but again was able to tweak them to my liking using all the various condiments available. The sourdough roll was mehhh but it wasn't a crucial part to the meal  Buffalo Chili with Rice - they put rice on the bottom, then poured the chili (which looked like the baked beans mixed with some other ingredients) on top. My friend definitely ate it all, so I'm assuming it was pretty tasty.  HOWEVER, I learned that we had come here for the wrong reason entirely. I know now to come here for DRINKING purposes solely. Not only does it have a crazy interior with random stuff stapled to every part of its walls (including the ceiling) making it mysterious and like you're in the middle of a crazy twisted game of Clue, but they have a ridiculous listing of alcoholic beverages. Over 100 types of beers (AHH!! my heaven!), but I also saw a list of 20+ liquor/liqueur coffee beverages (YUM!).   Honestly, if this place had outdoor seating, I think I might have found my drinking mecca in the city for lazy afternoons; unfortunately they don't have a patio (probably a good thing for me so I'm not constantly drinking during the afternoon on weekends!).  But I'll definitely be back for drinks, and then to try some of the other crazy food dishes they have randomly. I think with drinks, they'll pair amazingly.",

Brisket: The humble base that both pastrami and corned beef derive from. \u00a0Could have been a tad more tender, but was still full of beef juicy goodness.  Ham: It was decent, but not remarkable. \u00a0Perhaps I'm spoiled by the crispy outsides (a la Honey Baked Ham) that this one did not have.  Roast Beef: Too rare and not enough flavor. \u00a0I like when a roast beef slice possesses a gamut of well done to rare as you move from the outside in.  Turkey: Pretty nasty. \u00a0Tasted like cold turkey slightly reheated. \u00a0A bit too dry.  Baked Beans: AMAZING! \u00a0Sticky and firm. \u00a0Very savory too. \u00a0Best baked beans I've had outside of Boston and Montr\u00e9al.

The food smelled good &amp; looked good but that's honestly where it ended for me.  I had a taste of my fiancee's BBQ sandwich which came with Mashed Potatoes &amp; it was good. BBQ sauce was more liquidy (is that even a word) the I liked but the overall taste was good. But when it came to my meatball sandwich &amp; the clam chowder the taste went completely down hill. My meatball sandwich was placed on extremely chewy french bread, the sauce had no flavor and the meatball itself was actually kind of hard. OH &amp; THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT THEY ONLY GIVE YOU 2 FREAKING MEATBALLS.... 2!!!! Anyways finished that in a hurry because I was hungry but honestly I wanted to go back &amp; complain. On top of that the Clam Chowder was watery, didn't have enough clams &amp; WAS SPICY? (huh) who in the right mind makes spicy clam chowder?   Anyways I've give this place another try because I just heard that we got the wrong things. His sister-in-law said their best thing on the menu is their Beef Brisket so the next time I'm there I'll be sure to order it.   LAST the bitch taking drink orders is a straight bitch.

This place is a very old establishment. I have driven by here countless times but never stopped in. In fact I never knew it was a hofbraus until now!  The first thing you see when you walk in is a huge sign that says CASH ONLY. You order up at the counter and pay the cashier at the end. We both ordered the braised lamb shank served with a side of potatoes and carrots, with a heavy portion of gravy. He ordered two shanks and I opted for one. You also get a piece of bread as well. I figured I'd be full with these huge portions anyway. I was absolutely right after chowing down the entire platter.   The restaurant is mostly self-service with the exception of drinks. A waiter comes around and takes your drink order. You can also order your drink directly from the bar but why bother when someone will come by anyway? They have a comprehensive list of drafts and a full bar.   Super cheap prices, good food, and being open very late makes this a great place.",

Across from the hotel lived Tommy's, and with a mural of a dapper gentleman on the outside, the recommendation nod from the taxi driver and the promise of a decent beer list, this place became an easy choice.  My delicate demeanour would not be disappointed.   This place is buffet style comfort food. Nothing to write home about but the buffalo stew was decent. The table service is non existent and it's cash only.  But who cares? They have a great beer list and their vibe is laid back enough to handle the space cadet that is Jody Hungover. They introduced me to Red Branch black cherry cider and that alone is worth my four stars.   This isn't the spot to hit if you're looking to impress, but if you're seeking a spot to have a bit of hair if the dog, in a funky atmosphere that quickly fills with an amazingly eclectic crowd and pay less then $8 for a decent craft brew?

The servers are nice and cheery, and their cafeteria style line moves pretty quickly. They have a huge assortment of beers on one side of the joint and the food on the other so it's easy to get a drink while you wait for someone else to get your order, or you can set your food down and then grab a drink. The food is kind of so-so for me. You can tell the meat would be great and mouthwatering coming straight out of the oven (like on Food Network's DDD) but my lamb shank was way past its freshness. My boyfriend's roast beef looked great being carved off of what looked like a steaming half of a cow but it dried out once we got it to the table. The sauce on pretty much every dish is scrumptious, and that halfway makes up for the not-as-great-as-they-should-be meats. But love the little sourdough bread roll that comes with the entrees. It was a great food experience since I've never been to a cafeteria style restaurant with decent food, not to mention this place has been around forever.

Don't let the crowd deter you, the guys behind the counter move that line FAST. \u00a0Help 'em out with that and use the ATM before you get in line, Tommy's Joynt is cash only. \u00a0There are three more rooms for seating upstairs, so I've never had trouble finding seats for family sized parties. \u00a0Only downside, after getting situated it can be tough to catch your barmaid's attention, but cut the ladies some slack, they are always busy and moving fast. \u00a0If you're that thirsty there's nothing stopping you from walking to the bar yourself to order from their impressive selection of beers from around the globe.",

    "review_text": "Came here last week in celebration of finals being over, and boy did we choose the right spot.   ***CASH ONLY****  MEAT LOVERS UNITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I walked into the restaurant to find myself merging in a line that led up to the meat gods of all time. You tell them what you want and they'll cut/plate right in front of you. I got the roast of beef dinner plate and tried the BBQ beef brisket. May I say, HOLY MOTHER OF COWS. They were both super juicy and absolutely melted in my mouth as it met with the palate of my tongue.   Roast of beef dinner plate ($10.95): 4 stars! Thinly sliced pieces of roast beef were served medium rare with whatever side you chose in which I got the mashed potatoes, sourdough bread, and beans which were superbly amazing. The price with what you got were insanely jaw dropping. Most of my friends did not even get to finish their plates because it was so big.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tommys-joynt-san-francisco?select=gLyTo2KL_g1dDdIDNPiHzw#gLyTo2KL_g1dDdIDNPiHzw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tomm\u2026</a>  BBQ Beef Brisket dinner plate ($10.95): 4.5 stars! Chunks of marinated bbq briskets looked too thick to be chewed on, but right when it went in my mouth, it literally serenaded my taste buds making it fall in love. It was very flavorful and extremely tender. Definitely getting this next time I come!   You basically choose your own seat wherever you find one after you order and enjoy your meal with good music that soothes you as you eat. The bar was easy to access with waiters who came to ask you what you wanted to drink.",

It's a made-to-order sandwich place, so you can totally customize your sandwich. I went with typical turkey and cheese (I originally wanted ham, but they were out of it at a little after noon). It was a great sandwich! They turkey was juicy and the bread was hearty. They also have a lot of choices for sides. I went with coleslaw, which I thought was good, but not amazing.  My favorite part was the spicy hot mustard on the tables. It's very spicy and a bit horseradish-ey, but so good! It definitely took my sandwiches to the next level.  Tommy's Joynt certainly satisfied our group! If I lived in San Francisco, I'd be back for sure.",

Ordered Ham Dinner with mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, and a swiss cheese sandwich for the next day. I went home to enjoy my meal, and everything seemed fantastic, but within a few hours, I seemed to be ill from it, spent all early morning and day making restroom trips to get the food out of me in the most violent manner. Because of this, I became severely dehydrated, fatigued, pains in my stomach, intestines, headache and lethargic. I wrote Tommy's Joynt on Facebook to inform them of the issue, but since I never got a response, I felt this review may get their attention.  Based on what I expelled, copious amounts of a gravy type sauce mixed with coleslaw material, I felt that the holding temps of the food, the ingredients as well as sanitation may not have been up to health code standards. While I am much better now, I feel that I can never dine here again - drinks and cocktails maybe, but as for food, I'd skip it. The hot bar is just too small, things are too close, too much potential for cold things to get hot, hot things to get cold, and most of all, cross contamination to happen for me to willing to risk this type of illness again.  It hurts for me to say skip a San Franciscan tradition but in this case, at least rethink other pub like places before this one.",

I was so excited when I walked in and saw many of my favorites on the menu for the day. \u00a0The goodies were everything bad for you, and to complement the fatty meaty items, they give you bread and all sorts of assorted starch.  My least favorite dish was the sweet and sour ribs. \u00a0They were flavorful, but they were slightly dry. \u00a0This mishap was quickly corrected by the other crazy good foods that I stuffed into my stomach.  The buffalo chili was spot on with flavor, meatiness, and complexity, and it was served over some rice. \u00a0The corned beef and cabbage was as good as any New York diner's CB&amp;C. \u00a0The beef was ridiculously fatty, and the skinned boiled potatoes were a great addition to the greasy goodness.  Now the enchiladas... my goodness. \u00a0They were \"supposedly\" turkey, but I could have sworn that they were filled with pulled pork. \u00a0They were moist, meaty, and just so good. \u00a0The sauce was a tad bland, but that did nothing to detract from the glorious turkey meat. \u00a0I bet you they used 100% dark leg meat soaked in its own fat and shredded and soaked in more of its own fat.  Sure, Tommy's is all famous and stuff now, but if you are looking for a delicious, thrifty no frills meal, this is your \"Joynt.\" \u00a0It is in a convenient location, and it serves grade-A comfort food.",

And it wasn't the \"delicious spiced corn beef\" saltiness, it was the face cringing \"holy shit they just served me a patty of salt with bits of beef in it\" saltiness.  I ate the potatoes to balance out the flavor then quickly realized the potatoes tasted like green beans. \u00a0GREEN BEANS! wtf? I like it when mashed potatoes have an additional taste like garlic, truffles or bacon (really anything with bacon..you could serve me bacon infused water and I'd give you 5 stars) but green beans? It literally tasted like they used green bean water to create the potatoes. And it had the consistency of \"instant\" potatoes with no chunks so I was so confused by this 2nd trip.  So yeah weirdly inconsistent food quality. I'll go again as I'm thinking maybe it was a fluke and it's one of the best places in the area to just grab a drink.   Which brings us to the biggest positive about this place. The beer, alcohol selection, and environment is great. Fun place to just hang with your friends and grab a few beers as they have a good number of beers on top that aren't your usual blue moon, lagunitas, stella, etc . The waitress constantly checked up on us to make sure we had a beer to enjoy and she even called us \"honey\". I have a soft spot in my heart for that word being from the south =)",

This might be due to the fact that when I've been here, it's been girls night out and we're headed to or coming from a concert.   The food here is good, filling, comfort food. I LOVE the beef with mashed potatoes and gravy and a salad with extra beets (YUM!). On Saturday nights, it's fun to sit at a booth near their basement kitchen and watch the amount of food (whole turkeys, whole roasts, etc.) that come cranking out of the kitchen and are carried to the food line.   My girls and I are known for coming here for dinner, heading to a show, and then coming back for a 1am snack/cocktail and chat away until they close. \u00a0On our last visit, I debated if I wanted to get a plate to go so I could have a 4am snack once I got back home to the east bay. \u00a0By the time I decided yes, the food line was being closed down and those beloved beets and creamy mashed potatoes had been put away. \u00a0Darn it!  My only complaint is waiting forever to get drinks. Usually we're almost done with our meal by the time our drinks come. However, you won't find a more economical cocktail anywhere! Cheers!",

Having never been there, I asked the first cook what their best item was. He suggested something that I couldn't understand but I took it. It turned out to be their baked lasagna. Their baked beans were advertised as a \"staple\" so I ordered them too. The lasagna was sub-par at best and the beans were decent.

Actually, that's pretty much the experience here ... you walk in, and there's a queue. \u00a0Once it's your turn, you let the guy know what you want and he'll scoop it up or cut your meat and serve it to you on a plate with a plastic tray beneath it. \u00a0As you make your way down the line, they'll ask you what else you want to add to your sad looking tray and at the end you pay. \u00a0Cash only though!  Now... I had the Beef Stew and Rice as I was feeling some dense food, but unfortunately it was not very appetizing. \u00a0The beef was overcooked, not tender, and very dry.. the stew that it was sitting in had a very salty, tomato base. \u00a0Grain quality of the rice was low, meh.  I also got a quick bite of my friends' plates, and in a sum ... only the Sliced Corn Beef w/ the Hot Mustard on the table and the BBQ Brisket were decent. \u00a0Corn beef was a little salty, but paired well with the mustard and the BBQ Brisket was a little sweet and reminded me of Chinese Cha Siu.  I question the quality of the meat, but I guess you can't be that snobby about it for the price. \u00a0I wouldn't necessarily recommend anyone to come back, but I guess you can give it a try if you're looking for some quick, cheat eats. \u00a0The service here however was on point and great! \u00a0Despite it being self served water, the waiters still brought us our drinks! \u00a0c:",

Finally, I got the opportunity to eat lunch here when my friends wanted to grab some food after the SF Ski Fest over at Fort Mason.   Walking in, there's an area sectioned off for a line right by the entrance -- that's where you enter the queue to order your food. The menu is all over the place and according to my friend: everything's good. I decided to split a BBQ beef sandwich on sourdough bread with one of my friends. It wasn't huge, but the portion was perfect since I wasn't really that \u00a0hungry anyways. Food was decent... Nothing amazing, but a far cry from bad. Prices were pretty cheap seeing as they give fairly reasonable sized portions of meat.   One of my friend's got the Sunday special and another got the turkey sloppy joe. Everyone seemed happy with their food. The staff is pretty friendly and were nice enough to change the channel on the TV to watch the football game.  At old joints like this, I'm a little weary about what the bathrooms are like, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was fairly well maintained, although nothing like a newer restaurant.  Would I return? Probably only if someone else wanted to go here... Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest coming back because there are better cheap eats out in the city. However, I do see how this place has become a landmark! Definitely worth trying it at least once. I mean, how many places carve the meat right in front of you after you order?!",

We went with pseudo-Thanksgiving dinner: scoop of stuffing topped with plenty of thinly sliced white and dark meat, and lots of gravy with mashed potatoes. All the food was fresh enough; it's refilled frequently as there as always people here. Although, the apple pie we had tasted sadly store bought.  A few random perks! Carrot and raisin salad instead of broccoli salad. Steamed vegetables really are just frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrot cubes, green beans). Free pickles, serve yourself. Dark saloon seating with booths that fit two people very nicely. Line moves fast; but cash only. Not much for vegetarians, obviously. Maybe a $2.50 swiss cheese sammich??  Food and drink served until 145am means that we may be back here for late night grub one of these summer evenings...",

We got there at 6:15 pm right as the dinner crowds were beginning to line up. I got one of the two metered parking spaces right in front of the restaurant. This is a Hof Brau style order you food of the line pay a find a seat. There were about 8 people ahead of us in line including one of the ushers from the Giants game.   I heard that the turkey was good, so we ordered the turkey plate and the Roast Beef Plate $9.25. Good price, \u00a0good portions, tasted good. Paid for the food found the last remaining seats near the line of people. Drink orders are to be ordered from the waitress. Waitress? What waitress? Finally after we were almost done with dinner and getting our own water a waitress came bay to get out drink order.   Food was fast, decent taste, great price. CASH ONLY. Since we sat right next to line people were asking what we ordered. The problem for the people in line after us, was the seating availability. The tables were taken and the bar was full. I just don't get the concept and flow. You get your food, condiments, and pay. But not drinks. Then a waitress come around to take your drink order and you pay again.

    "review_text": "UPDATE: Over a year after my last visit to Tommy's I was excited to make my comeback! Regardless of its touristy vibe, this place still rocks! \u00a0Zack is still behind the bar with his mad pouring skills, sharp wit, and ready smile. But look! What's this?!? A pretty bartender named Nicole?? Off duty, she sat with us and plugged her ipod into my musical purse. We huddled around the weak sounds emitting from the wee speakers and busted our bar-stool move. \u00a0Nice lady, that one. Zack's nice, too. He took the untouched half of my sandwich and offered it to the homeless man outside. \u00a0 Between all of that, and the fact that once Zack's pouring skills finally knock you over, you have interesting stuff to try to focus on firmly nailed to the ceiling...(think a backwoods TGIF) I realized how much I had missed this place.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Somewhere between the evening ending of Lovefest and the late night clubbing of the after party, there was Tommy's Joynt. We needed to keep our blood alchohol-ed and our spirits high.  I'd seen Tommy's muralled and olde-fashioned lettered walls often as I went through SF. \u00a0It reminded me of Cheers. \u00a0But, no one there knows my name. \u00a0It seemed that they were glad we came. \u00a0I don't think the people were all the same.  We sat at a looooong table with a couple from Canada who were going to a 49ers game and then on to Vegas to be married, and two guys from Eng-er-land. (YUM!!! Love those Limeys!) \u00a0We all were soon drinking together and laughing. \u00a0The man from Canada started making Irish jokes as soon as he realized my family tree's roots came from the Emerald Isle. \u00a0  \"What's green and has an asshole every three feet?\" he asked. \"What?\" I replied, warily. \"A St. Patty's day parade!!! HAWHAWHAWHAW!!!\" he seemed so impressed with himself until I asked: \"What's it like living in America-lite?\" He laughed harder. \u00a0Good men can give and take a joke!  The drinks were nicely leaded, and though the service was a bit slow, the atmosphere was great. \u00a0I'll go back to strap on the ol' bottle again soon.",

Or maybe I just figured, hey i'm young, i want to see what's out there.   And so in that 18 hours, I of course was asked on a date, and I of course accepted.  And believe it or not, this lunch date was at Tommy's Joint \u00a0(classy dude for a classy gal)  I'd been craving pastrami for weeks, for some freakish reason and was overjoyed to find that Tommy's Joint not only had pastrami but they also had the biggest most amazing pastrami sandwich in all of San Francisco.  Being a fat eastcoaster, i'm used to large portions. San Francisco is really great at skimping on quantity, especially when it comes to sandwiches (and attractive straight men, for that matter), so finding a GIANT hunk of meat and bread at Tommy's Joint came as a pleasant surprise.  HOWEVER, I only ate half of my sandwich, despite wanting the whole thing, because my p--ssy date only ate half of his sandwich, and i hate being THAT girl.  I have regretted the decision ever since.",

Some of their stuff i can go without (like their potato salad) but others i crave. Different day have different specials and the lamb shanks are awesome.

This hof brau is full of locals &amp; visitors alike and the main floor seating is set up as long shared tables giving a very casual vibe- there are two rooms upstairs as well. There is a huge selection of delicious meats - I recommend the BBQ Pulled Pork or Pastrami Sandwich- and then your choice rice or potatoes and veggies or salads. Prices are very reasonable (about $8 for meat, salad &amp; potatoes) and the portions are quite large - 3 of us split 2 dinners an that was plenty! The bar is very reasonable ($7-9) for mixed drinks and they do not skimp on alcohol or flavor. \u00a0Highly recommended!",

The beer selection is similarly good but not perfect--while there are a number of solid, flavorful beers, there was only one IPA (Big Daddy) and only one Belgian-style ale (Chimay). \u00a0While arguably a beer-snob lineup would not fit in a joint like this, it would have been a welcome addition.

    "review_text": "As a meat lover, this is honestly one of my all time favorite places to eat. After living two blocks away for a little over a decade, I finally decided to try it a few years ago, and since then I've never looked back. When I first tried it, I was kind of a noob and just got a plain ole' sandwich, but for a simple bread, meat, and condiments kind of sandwich, it was really good. When faced with many options of meat, as a beef lover I tend to choose brisket. The meat is tender and the fatty part definitely adds to the flavor, but if you don't want too much fat, just ask them for a lean cut and they'll gladly do it. Their sandwiches are nothing special, really, but it's a good hearty lunch meal.  My usual meal is a beef brisket dinner plate, which comes with two sides: baked beans or mashed potatoes, and your choice of salad (potato, bean, etc.). Not only am I a beef lover, I'm also a potato lover, so I'm sure you can guess what I order. I don't know how else to describe this plate besides heavenly. The sauce they drizzle over the meat just enhances the flavor, and the potato salad counteracts it with a cool light flavor, along with an occasional crunch of celery.   Another one of my favorites is the lamb shank special, offered on both Thursdays and Sundays (it's that good!). The meat just falls right off the bone, and doesn't have that gamey taste that lamb sometimes has. It's drenched in sauce, which actually goes very well with the complimentary bread you receive. The little potatoes that come with it complete the meal.   Other favorites include Monday's braised oxtail special, and Saturday's spare ribs. I think the best thing about their meat is that it's so flavorful, and it really just falls off the bone. The carbs complement it, and the chefs here just know all around how to put a meal together. They have a bar as well, which boasts beers from all over the world, but as an under-21 diner, I have yet to try it. It's a very classic American bar kind of atmosphere, but they have upstairs seating if you'd like something a little quieter. Also, it is cash only, so come prepared!",

Cash only (ATM inside), TONS of seating with a huge ground floor area including long bar, and large size upstairs in back. HDTV's throughout.  Most of the time I'll get the BBQ Brisket dinner plate. The bbq sauce is not intensely flavorful, but the flavor it has is excellent; moderately smokey and very sweet, while having a nice thick consistency. Tender, delicious meat and nice large portions. Quite a bit of fat, which I personally love, but it should be said.   The mashed potatoes are good but not great, made a lot better with the bbq sauce. Most of the time the sourdough rolls are quite hard, but only on the outside, the inside is always soft and delicious. Grab extra butter if you like more than one small packet. Haven't had many of the greens, but any time I did they were average. However, the green salad is great and I love their blue cheese dressing.  Excellent pastrami sandwiches as well, and they have great sweet mustard and hot mustard on every table.  Great selection of beers from around the world, too. You only order food in the line, and once you sit down a waitress will take drink orders. \u00a0BE SURE to grab some of the free house-made pickles just past the free water machines (though its not cold, for cold water go to the upstairs one).  Be ready to get full, for as little as $8! Parking can be tricky during peak dinner hours and during big sports events, but this place is easily one of my favorite pig-out spots in this city!",

It took a good 10 mts of standing in line before we got to order. The good thing is you get your food right away.  I tried the bbq-beef which was so flavorful and tender, it was literally falling off the bone and melted in my mouth. Also tried the knackwurst (garlic sausage) sandwich which came with delicious au-jus sauce. The sandwich which makes my mouth water as I write this was only $3.50!!! This place rocks. And they have a nice bar too.",

The stew may be a bit salty for some folks, but it was just right for me. The potatoes weren't anything special, but were still good. I got a beer to wash it down. The waitress was friendly, and it was a great place to catch some of the Giants game.  I got the BBQ brisket sandwich on a sourdough roll my second time there. The brisket and the BBQ sauce were very, very good. The sourdough roll was alright. Still, it was a pretty big sandwich for $6, which made for a great lunch.  I'll be back soon!",

Spaghetti &amp; meatballs - meatballs are always tasty, but this last time I ate there, the noodles tasted bland w/ the sauce. a little disappointed. 5. my other half - ordered the roast beef sandwich w/ au jus on the side. he wasn't impressed. a little dry.  6. friend ordered - pastrami sandwich-- can't go wrong!   get your own water, bring cash, if you come on a THURS, come early for BRAISED LAMB SHANKS! off the hook. they have daily specials every day of week, never change!   bar options: pint of beer or half pint (such a cute glass!) drinks are pretty cheap/dive prices. but also, dive sized glasses!

When it comes to meat, I am quite a critic! I look at texture, taste, rubberiness, and the sauce. I went for dinner, thus I ordered their Dinner Plates, which comes with a choice of 6 different cuts. I ordered the BBQ brisket, and it was amazing!  Before we get to the meat, lets start with service! The service was very good. It was my first time ordering, so I was very indecisive, \u00a0but the workers were very patient. They helped me step by step, asking me what sides and entrees I would like. Then while being seated, they helped take our trays and turned on the T.V. to watch the Lakers game! Earned a star just with the service.  Now the food... which was amazing! They mash potatoes that comes with the meat is amazing. The gravy is a very mild sauce, with a hint of parsley in it. It goes great with the meat overall! Then you have the choice between a bowl of beans or a salad. I chose salad with ranch, which was just a typical salad.  The meat was very, very well prepared. They give you a good portion, enough for a meat-eater like myself to be full by. Most the cuts were very easy to cut and went down smoothly. But this is where my 5 star dropped to a 4. The last 2 cuts of meat were like rubber! I tried cutting the meat but it felt like trying to cut a cow with a baseball bat! It just wouldn't cut! So i tried stuffing the whole thing in my mouth, but was a complete failure! I had to chug water and swallow the cuts whole!   Overall a wonderful little BBQ joint that should be visited by any San Francisco noobie.",

The initial hesitation in coming here was purely looking from the outside in. \u00a0Tommy's is not a trendy or amazing eatery, but it does the job as a cheap haven for comfort food lovers served cafeteria style. \u00a0What kind of food exactly? \u00a0Meat and lots of it.  Presentation is not one of their strengths. \u00a0The execution from the first scoop to the final \"plop\" on the pate makes for an unpleasant and almost unappetizing experience. \u00a0 Often dry and a sloppy mess, it wouldn't be so much of a stretch to compare the look to prison food. \u00a0\\Jamie Oliver's food revolution clearly never made it here - he'd fail miserably trying to convert this Joynt.  If only prison folk ate so well, the buffalo stew over rice is awesome at 1AM as well as their meatballs. \u00a0The hearty BBQ Ribs deserve some recognition, best enjoyed with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy or even turkey legs (enhanced chicken drumstick!) with a side of potato salad. \u00a0The brisket and corned beef is also quite nice - tender, juicy, and perfectly complemented with side of horse radish.  I'm still not sold on their coleslaw, salads, or their overcooked lamb shank. \u00a0I've had subpar results with their sloppy joe combos, especially the turkey (which is awesome on it's own but does not go well with the sloppy joe mix). \u00a0A good way to rebound any fail on this end would be with a pastrami sammy, one of the best things they have to offer.  Don't expect the cleanest interior or amazing service. \u00a0Beyond the cafeteria service, the communal style dining via the picnic tables makes for a fun, yet casual touch. \u00a0Scoring napkins are almost a luxury here when they haven't run out yet.  It's a cash only joynt, which may be a problem for those who are credit lovers and ATM haters. \u00a0The prices aren't bad for SF standards, at about $8-12 for a good bit of food and a solid selection of well and beer drinks. \u00a0Just be sure to come in hungry, since the service and griminess of the place are enough to make enough folks head for the door.",

One couple was pushing their giant baby stroller through it, which seemed strange to me when they could have just left it in one spot. I mean, the line is that tiny - they would have been within arm's reach no matter where in line they were. Oh, and on my first turn through the line, what do I see? Guy Fieri's mug staring back at me from a poster on the wall. Goddammit, that guy is everywhere, making the lines ridiculously long at all the restaurants I want to try.  After being herded through like mini-cattle, you get to the counter where you order anything from corned beef &amp; cabbage to meatballs &amp; spaghetti (that's what they call it). Most of the dishes involve roasted or braised meats and they have a daily special board that looks like it hasn't changed in a decade or two. I passed on the Saturday special - sweet &amp; sour spareribs - in favor of pastrami on a sourdough roll with Swiss cheese and a side of stuffing with gravy. The sandwich was pretty solid. Nice, big, hand-sliced hunks of pastrami on a chewy roll - add some hot mustard - tasty. The stuffing was just ok. Same with the mixed bean salad. It appears the meat is king here and the sides are just for show, which is fine by me.  The servers are quick with drink service and the barrel of all-you-want-as-long-as-you-eat-them pickles is a nice touch. They should probably expand the counter up front where you order. I saw them bring out a couple whole roast beefs but there was seemingly no room for them. Some questionable things happened to make them fit - nothing that turned me off but the squeamish types should probably look away when fresh meat comes out from the kitchen.  I will definitely make a return trip to Tommy's. It's probably the best deal in town.",

The dining selections consist of sandwiches of dinner plates. I had a corn beef sandwich, which is served with a small cup of jus, a side of potato salad and a slice of apple pie. The sandwich was huge and tasty. The pie was great as it had a nice taste of cinnamon in it.   This is not for someone that is looking for a modern fine dining experience. This is for those that love meat and want to sit down in a piece of history and enjoy their meal with other like minded people.",

The turkey could have been softer. It didn't exactly fall off the bone. The stuffing was so mushy, it was almost like mashed potatoes, but good nonetheless. I can't believe I finished the whole thing, except the dinner roll. John got the turkey dinner. It came with mashed potatoes and salad. He didn't finish it of course. Kevin got the burgundy beef. It looked good. I will probably get that next time. We stocked up on the free pickles. I must say, those were some damn good pickles.   Overall, it was a good dinner. It was super cheap and super filling. You definitely get your money's worth. However, the food itself wasn't that great.

I should have known it would be gross the moment I saw that Guy Douche (as my friends call him) Guy Fieri poster up. I guess if you like his style - sloppy and \"there's a reason it's so cheap\" food. I mean, I'm from Texas so I can get down with some home-style cooking and my BF was in the military for years, we aren't picky. But this was not worth ever returning to.  I gave two stars, one for the affordable prices and one for the really nice waitress who asked our drink order.   I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The noodles were mushy, like they'd been sitting in water for hours (I think they had). The sauce was literally like water, almost clear in appearance and taste. They forgot to put any meatballs in there, even though I tried to ask if they could add it, guess they were in a hurry to get me through the line. It literally tasted like mushy water.  My guy ordered a \"buffalo sandwich\" and we aren't sure if they messed up the order or if it was really supposed to be this, but he got meatballs on bread (swimming in the same watery sauce). If it was buffalo meatballs, they should have stated that on the menu...   I think my BF put it best, \"What are we? Soviet sailors on some death-ship? They just move you down the line.. bread, *plop* on some soupy sauce.. Next! \u00a0bread, *plop*...

    "review_text": "Oh SF you disappoint me. This is the place where Yelp was invented and what is supposed to be a foodie town with almost no equal. 4 stars over 1400 reviews so you cannot possibly steer me wrong. So let me start with an early demolition of your beloved landmark.  I set my GPS destination for a sure bet with a good burger but I got caught up in the mix of all these 1000+ review restaurants with high ratings. One stuck in my mind because of the name I didn't want to go to it. But somehow my GPS misguided me and along the way to my surefire good burger I pass by Tommy's Joynt and spied numerous patrons through the windows. I thought to myself, it's crowded, it can't be bad, let's try it. So I make a U-turn at my first chance and head back and park right next to the restaurant.  On my way out, I was greeted by a bum who wouldn't let me go in. When I got in, it said form a line to the left which on a rainy Monday night was non-existent. So I walk to the counter and ask them for what's good. He said try the roast beef or corned beef and I said why not both? He said OK and so he started sawing away at the thick bark on a somewhat tasty looking chunk of roast beef. My eyes turn to the sides and I saw what looked like whipped potatoes, so unappealing because they've lost their entire heritage and looked like cheap oatmeal. Craving something green, I opted for the green beans which were a pale shade of old Christmas tree. Next up was the salad and I couldn't decided between the wilted pickled greens that were crisp probably a few hours ago or the potato salad which I think were the safest bet so I picked the potato salad.  I found myself a lonely seat back at the bar with an old man behind the bar. I asked him kindly for a Chimay Red which he happily exchanged with me for $6.50. This place is cash only like so many other places in SF and it's probably the only way they survive with all the taxes here. Humorous was the sign near the register that said tip was included in the price of the drinks, but not humorous to Uncle Sam.  I dug into my food and found myself hacking away at the tough bark of the roast beef and cut off a piece as if I was going to eat it but realized I would be seeing the dentist the next day should I try. I discarded it and proceeded to add some horseradish from some questionably sanitary containers to my plate. Thank goodness for horseradish because it made what would be a barely palpable bite turn into a nostril burn that made life interesting for a few seconds. Then after it wore off, reality hit and I was eating warm Oscar Meyer cold cuts on a plate on top of a rickety old bar in San Francisco with a disturbing old man behind the counter. I turn to the green beans for some relief but they would not relent and gave me a taste of cafeteria food at Leisure World. Squeaky on your teeth and strangely soft, it's a wonderous world we live in to have foods transform into the most unlikely tastes and textures.  I can accept why people would eat here and possibly enjoy the food, but I cannot imagine why after 1400+ reviews that it can maintain a 4 star rating. I can see that the bum on the sidewalk that wouldn't let me in might rate it 4 stars on a good day but I expected more from you San Franciscans because you're supposed to be foodies and know better than this. You have mislead me, wasted my time here, disappointed me, and hurt my tummy with this garbage. Hometown buffet would never be rated 4 stars in SoCal, how could you do this to me?",

I really wanted to like this place because I love meat, and I loved the idea of hearty comfort food in an unpretentious, cafeteria-style environment. I was very disappointed. Would not come here again and wouldn't recommend this place to others.",

They were SO sloppy - it was like the bread they were on soaked up all the goodness of the juices they were in. I literally cleaned my plate, by swabbing it with a piece of bread. So delicious.  Their potato salad? Good ol classic San Francisco Potato Salad. Yum yum yum. Cleaned that plate too. I cant get enough of the food here.

Mmm big thick sandwiches, buffalo chili, beer, and wierd ass cocktails that are 3 bucks. \u00a0What could go wrong?  Main course is an awesome value, sides were a little expensive though, so stick to the meat, beer and free pickle jar and you'll be just fine.

We thought he was crazy, but we grew to love the place. I had the buffalo stew my first visit, over 20 years ago, I fell in love with the place instantly.   This is how i describe this place to first timers, \"they have everything you want to eat, and it's all good.   You want home made cooking here is where you go: roast turkey, roast chicken, roast beef, lamb, Buffalo meat, Stew, Chili, home made gravy, Dogs, Deli and Hot sandwiches and the sides to die for, Cole slaw, baked beans, mash potatoes and gravy, three bean salad, pickled beats, rice, tossed salad with made from scratch Ranch.   The ambiance is like an old, old wild west bar crossed with a NY style deli. Don't expect the place to be clean. But it's an important part of the experience. Food is served up fresh and hot cafeteria style. Friendly service. Prices are very reasonable.   This is a full bar as well, they must have over 100 beers on the menu. Many on tap. Not being a drinker, I can not comment on the bar except it is extensive.   Food I have had; Roast Turkey, Stew, Corn-beef and Cabbage with potatoes and carrots, Roast beef, BBQ ribs, ALL GOOD!   Comfort food all the way. A must try!",

This is a pretty cool hang out around since they have big tables for large parties, and additional upstairs seating also. They have a full bar so it's a pretty neat place to hang out after work or just to catch up.   If you don't want to have a sit down meal, you can order carry out as well.

What a shame!  \u00a0Tonight was an Enlightment of the Brisket. It was Sunday night/ Monday morning and Mel's closed 15 min earlier than posted. Fortunately the waiter at Mel's told us to go over to Tommy's. And I luck out to behold Brisket Nirvana.  \u00a0My friend and I hopped across the street and found that they still had a fair amount of patrons at 10 till 1AM. My friend ordered Roast Beef while I was thinking Brisket. I pointed to the Pastrami next the succulent Brisket which I thought was a rare slab of Brisket and the he server quickly corrected me. \u00a0I was about to order the Pastrami Dinner since that looked pretty good. Then he said that the Brisket was better. Okay, 'So Brisket it is.' \u00a0And he drizzled it with a good helping of BBQ sauce. \u00a0It's by far the best piece of beef I ever had. I think I've had enough beef to able to tell how it should be done right. The meat was tender and \u00a0easily sliced into with the steak knife. Slice, bite, slice, bite, slice...   \u00a0I was an efficient machine with the circular motion of my left wrist. Savoring my meat even more as I briefly pause to cut. I didn't remember needing to chew on it much for it almost melt in my mouth.    \u00a0Okay, maybe a little exaggerated, but I had a great cut with good portions. I almost wanted to chew the fat on the side. Plus their BBQ sauce fit my palate well . It wasn't overly sweet like most. The flavor complimented the meat well without overpowering it.  \u00a0Don't forget to add a little Chili Sauce for some kick. Now I wish they have Sweet Potato for sides. Then I'll go there every week. Can't wait to go back to try the Lamb Special.  \u00a0Oh yeah, my friend who ordered the Roast Beef said he will get the Brisket next time after I shared some of my portion.",

The exterior of Tommy's seems like any other run-down, cheesy touristy restaurant on the Van Ness corridor, which I think is why I have never tried it before. \u00a0The interior is not that much nicer, however it's definetely one of those few restaurants where cheesy and run-down is good.  Tommy's boasts a cafeteria-style \"kitchen\" (you grab a tray and run down the line as cooks pile food onto plates and serve you), along with a full bar. \u00a0The food is decent homestyle cooking - turkey dinners, bratwursts, corned beef, stew, etc. \u00a0Not fine dining by any means, but if you're in the mood for some heavy-sitting comfort food, this is definetely the place. \u00a0I had a turkey dinner (gravy, mashed potatoes, stuffing, choice of salad) which was not very impressive, but okay. \u00a0My husband had a pastrami sandwich and buffalo-style chili, both were quite good.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and you kind of get that old-timey saloon feel when sitting at the bar - probably because nothing has changed in the place for 60 years. \u00a0But, that's what gives Tommy's Joynt a unique charm.  Basically, if you're in the neighborhood and need a decent, yet cheap, place to eat, or if you are entertaining out-of-towners, go to Tommy's Joynt. \u00a0But don;t go out of your way.",

The hot mustard has a pretty strong kick to it and the horseradish is serious business, use with caution.   The service was really friendly and the food is quite enjoyable. Their sandwiches are also very reasonably priced, $6 for a huge sandwich. What's not to like?! Craving a sandwich right now....",

How did my prior venture into your chambers blow me away but my recent revisit left me hanging with an overwhelming amount of mixed confusion in love and disappointment?  Your sides were still on point (let's be real, nobody ever eats the sourdough...hard as a rock!) but your bbq brisket that once blew me away did not do the same. It was overcooked and dry. Where did the fatty bits that made this dish bombdotcom go?   In regards to the Buffalo stew, it's not THAT great. In fact, it was quite dry, gritty, and...just average to sum it up. The stew itself was delicious and hearty but the meat was overdone.",

Their service is counter-style, though you get table service for drinks. \u00a0It's pretty basic, minimal service, more self-service after you get your food, but the food and quirky atmosphere is enough to overcome all that for me.",

There was Sam's Original on Turk and Mason, and one big place in Fisherman's Warf that are gone.  Tommy's Joynt is a very good hof brau. The meats are cooked well. The pastrami is flavorful and along with the corned beef, are very tender. But the best thing is the prices. The portions they serve are at least your money's worth, if not more. For $5.60 I got a hot pastrami stacked on a sourdough roll. At my work they charge almost $6 for a processed turkey (4 slices) sandwich with sliced avacado. The dinner plate dishes are $8.50 and are fairly generous. They also have BUFFALO on the menu. It's in chili or stew. You'll have to wait in a queue at meal times, but it moves pretty good. They also have a full bar with an enormous selection of beers including Anchor Steam and Heineken on draft. Parking is on the street, but if you get tired of circling, Tommy's will validate the Cathedral Hill Garage for $3/hr up to 2 hrs.  All that makes Tommy's pretty cool. Check it out.",

I ended up getting the Tommy's Big Sandwich with pastrami on sourdough. \u00a0OH YUM must I say again. \u00a0I'm sure people on the East Coast will say this does not compare to Katz but I say it's the best in this area so far. \u00a0I also got Buffalo Chili which I don't think is quite worth the $5.95. \u00a0The meat is ground up and it's served on a bed of white rice which might be nice but it gets kind of boring to eat after a while. \u00a0I would pass on that next time.  So the way you do it is you walk in, stand in line, order at the counter, pay, then sit down. \u00a0If you want a drink, you can either go order it at the bar or a server will be with you really soon. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0She got our cokes and waters out quickly and even the money transaction took place before we even noticed. \u00a0Good service definitely adds to the experience but my favorite part is still how much character this place has!",

Best eaten with a knife and fork. Bread was meh. Turkey was okay. Mash was okay. Great value because it was a huge plate. Next time I wouldn't bother eating the bread.  Hubby ordered the buffalo chili which was served over rice with a dinner roll on the side. Chili was pretty good but not a huge portion for $6.75. Just a normal size.  Friend ordered the dinner plate with brisket but ended up with pastrami or corned beef by accident. It was okay. He also ordered a kielbasa to try which was not that great.

Hard to find places like this around anymore. Especially for the prices they have, my meal was only $8.50 without tax. That was real cheap. They have all types of hofbrau food here.

Besides that, they have really great dinner plate specials that change depending on what day of week it is. \u00a0Ox tail, lamb shank, and the salmon fillet are all pretty good nights to go. \u00a0If you don't go on one of those nights, the brisket place is usually a good alternative as well. \u00a0  They also have new items from time to time such as burgundy beef (which is ok), a giant turkey leg, and baked lasagna, which looks great and lasagny. \u00a0I have had the pasta there and you guessed it, there is meat in that too!  I had the salad once as a side, but that was probably the worst decision I have ever made. \u00a0Getting salad in a meat joint is just very silly. \u00a0Go here and challenge me for supremacy, you will be in a diehard battle!",

I also have a good friend that during her entire pregnancy ate a turkey sandwich from Tommy's weekly. I finally got the chance to try it yesterday...and it was average. It tasted good, but I guess it wasn't my thing. I had a meat ball sandwich, the meat was good, the sauce tasted like home made (just not made in my home), and the bread was too chewy. The restaurant itself is awesome though...there isn't a spot on the wall or ceiling that isn't covered by some piece of kitschy goodness. You should go just to check out the decor.  I took off one star for average sandwich, and another for a bad drink waitress who just couldn't get it together.",

I'll be honest, sometimes the meat is fattier than I like but, even on a small budget (1 $ sign) Tommy's doesn't disappoint.  Also, if you want some beer they have a beer list that will take you more than a few minutes to actually look over and will be sure to wash down any food consumed at this joynt.   As for sides- Coleslaw is OK  Mashed Potatoes and Gravy- Creamy GOODNESSSS [must have w/ any thing here] Beans - SWEET Chili - (Cup only) is tasty Cucumber Salad - Good  OH I almost forgot..the CHEESECAKE MMMMMM so cheesey and good...it's simple, plain, \u00a0did i mention cheesey, tasty, delicious NY style that is worth getting if you can fit it after your meal.",

Some of the patrons can be a little pushy if they think you're holding the line up, but don't mind them. If you're lucky to grab a seat in the back area you will get to peek into the kitchen and see trays of food or clean dishes get placed on a catering windowsill for a worker to bring to the front.  One thing I didn't quite understand is how beverages work - you order one after sitting down. Oh and I heard the bathrooms are pretty grimy. Expected but keep that in mind.

I got a side of mashed potatoes to go with my sandwich, and they weren't great, but if I was sloppy drunk, I probably would have loved them. When I ordered a Pyramid Hefeweizen with my meal, I was surprised when our waitress brought out a really tall glass of amber-colored liquid goodness instead of just bringing out a standard-sized beer bottle. They really don't water down their drinks at all over here, because everything we drank was hitting us pretty hard.   All in all, I would probably give Tommy's Joynt more of a 3.5 rating, but I usually round up on Yelp since there are no half-star ratings, hence the 4 star rating.

I thought the Lamb was good, really tender and flavorful. Didn't get to try the Beef Briskets, but it looked good. And of course the booze was good.   2nd visit. a Friday Ordered the Buffalo Stew over rice. I never had bufflo/bison meat before so this was my first experience. I thought it was really tough and flavorless. My mouth was sore from all the chewing and decided not to finish it. On the other hand, my friend got the Pastrami sandwich. I got to taste a little piece of the pastrami and it was pretty good. The bread was pretty bland and tough though. She said it was good so I don't know.   3rd visit.. A Friday Decided to change it up and order something else. This time I got the spaghetti with meatballs. The spaghetti was decent the meatballs were flavorful. Both on the salty side though ( and I have a salt tooth). My brother got the Beef Brisket. He said it was flavorless and bland.   In conclusion, I may pay another visit because it is cheap and the food is served in big portions. I don't think my body will like it very much (sodium overload).",

I got all the favorites... obviously I needed the lasagna, mac and cheese, slaw, mashed potato's, a nice cut of the lion, some corn beef, a meatball sub and a few rolls to top it off. My mouth was watering in anticipation as I anxiously awaited the divinity that was about to occur. I walked though the door and we immediately dived in... After a few bites of everything we started to get this strange feeling? What is wrong here? Why does this amazing food not taste good?

Once inside I realized that I was going to have a great time. \u00a0Numerous beers (mainly bottle) and a slightly surly bartender made for a comfortable bar experience. \u00a0The food (you pay for this separately) was cheap, plentiful, and delicious. \u00a0I had a corned beef plate that was truly delicious. \u00a0While I stuffed my face with tender meat and shockingly delicious coleslaw, my coworker gave me a brief history lesson on Tommy's Joynt which only added to my experience.  Although I didn't spend much time here (just one Anchor Steam Porter draught), I will definitely check it out again on my next trip to SF.  Cheers!",

    "review_text": "I came here cuz I saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives so maybe my expectations were too high. Visually and atmospherically the place is pretty cool and I was totally digging it while I waited in line. If you like crowded, noisy, cramped, old Western saloon meets old sports bar meets deli sandwich joint then you'll like TJ's. I happen to like all that so It was entertaining to check out all the old stuff everywhere and to try to figure out the various menu boards while I waited in line, which wasn't long. \u00a0Loved the price points as my family of five were all able to eat till we were stuffed (including dessert &amp; tip) for $50. We had clam chowder, pastrami sandwich, bbq sandwich, spaghetti w/meatballs, buffalo chili, choc chip cookies, and a pitcher of soda. As much as I liked the vibe, the decor, the price point and the variety of different kinds of food....the service was even better. The girl who helped us (Japanese girl?) was probably the most genuinely friendly and helpful food server I can recall meeting in a long, long time. Very sweet and helpful, a real delight. However, with all that said...I was disappointed in the food. For a landmark place I thought it'd be better. The chowder was okay, the buffalo chili was flavorful but unremarkable, the pastrami and roast beef were tough and chewy, the cookies were too sweet, the pasta was overcooked, the marinara was bland and the meatballs were not fresh. The only thing I really did think was exceptional was the sweet, tangy BBQ sauce that I poured liberally to put the average sandwiches into 'good' territory. \u00a0So, I'm not real sure I'd come back. Because of how cool and old world it looks inside and out I'm sure it's a great place for a TV show. But it's not something I'd drive out of my way again to visit if I'm hungry and want something even remotely remarkable in terms of food. If I were in the area and hungry and low on funds and the line wasn't too long I'd give it another go for sure. But otherwise, nah. But I'm glad I tried it once so I can at least be cool cuz I can say I've been there, done that but didn't buy a t-shirt.",

Okay maybe not exactly a hole in the wall since it's so popular, but when you're talking about wanting late night food at 12-1AM in the morning when you're stomach says feed me something that's not McDonalds, then look no further.  The first thing you will notice when you arrive is the ambience of the place. It's got that old school feel to it that feels like a bar, until you see the bbq popup stand that slaps you silly. We even had the pleasure of meeting the owner which was unexpected. But let me just jump straight into the food and what I liked about this place.  Brisket: The brisket here is super moist and definitely not like some of the dried up raisins that I've had at other places. They even have a nice juice that goes over the top as well, so it definitely puts a cherry on top.  Meat Sauce Spaghetti: This place carries a mean spaghetti and I'm not talking about one of those that you eat and you say...meh...that was okay. This one actually taste meaty since it's so well prepped with it's meat. Not only that, but the plate comes with the brisket! Boom! Who does that?!   Side Dishes: Everyone knows that I like side dishes. Well this places gives you a huge roll, beans, and some random pickles. Seriously it's got everything and guaranteed that you will be full afterwards. It's definitely worth it.",

These bros know their brews and they happy to chat with you about their favourite pint.  Along the right side is a Seinfeld Soup Nazi style deli. Be ready to order when you get to the til and don't ask questions. The food looks tasty and the buffalo stew was darn good. Not fall over in ecstasy delicious, but it's some quality comfort food for a pretty decent price.   Once you've got your mismatch of geeky craft beer and angry roast beef, grab a seat in the middle at one of the red and white diner cafeteria tables and enjoy while taking in the kitschy wonderland!  They have table service, but don't count on it. We between the two of us, we ordered one of six drinks from the server. I think trying to do the service thing but not coming through with it to the extent that it should be isn't that awesome of an idea, but you don't really need servers here anyway.

We started with the dinner plate with pastrami, mashed potatoes and a tossed green salad with ranch dressing. They didn't drench the salad with dressing, which was a good thing. Also ordered an apple cobbler.  Paid for everything before we sat down at a table and a waitress came by to take orders for drinks. She quickly drops off the bill and drinks. Any money left with the tab is for the waitress and money on the table is for the busboy. Hm, interesting.. So we proceeded to eat and it seemed as if the pastrami reminded me of honey roasted ham..

Well, my wife suggested Tommys Joint so we went. I had the Meatball \"OPEN FACE\" sandwich...or as I like to call it \"TEARS OF A VIRGIN ANGEL\" and it was to die for. The meatballs were so full of flavor that it would make Stephen Hawking jump out of his wheelchair and start doing the jerk....or the robocop...or the electric slide....you pick, I really dont care. They were huge and thats not all. The cook showers the bread with a marinara sauce...yummy. I swear he poured the sauce ever so slowly just to make my mouth water. Bastard. The sandwich does not come with a side but you can get anything from Mashers, salads, beans, cole slaw and many other side plates. They have a designated food court downstairs and upstairs. We sat upstairs since the lower lever was full. The lower level has the main bar and I am talking about a man's man bar. They have every beer known to man plus any hard alcohol your liver is trying to avoid. I am true gentleman so I order the Strawberry Daiquiri....I said gentleman so of course I asked for the little umbrella.   After my 9th drink, I either had too much to drink or someone let me use their time travel machine cause I do not remember how I got home.

Not only did I have my wedding rehearsal dinner here (which is a GREAT idea if you're on a budget, need a large, private back room for a party, and want to make sure that there are lots of delicious-yet-uncomplicated culinary options for everyone to eat), but several of my birthday parties, several for my husband, my friends, etc.!! \u00a0This is a wonderful, affordable, home-y meeting place where the portions are huge, the food is simple and delicious, and the prices are ridiculously low. \u00a0  If you are looking for foodie-appropriate rations, this is not your joynt. \u00a0Nor is it the right place to look for a high-brow crowd or fancy decor. \u00a0It's an old-school cafeteria-style restaurant/bar that slices your meat, piles it high on your plate with mashed potatoes, slathers it with gravy, tosses on a few veggies for a nice touch, offers you a choice of side salads, gives you a dinner roll with butter, and sends you on your merry way into a noisy, usually-packed diningroom that is full of average-joes eating, talking, watching \"the game\" on one of the many tv's, and tossing back a few cold ones while laughing with friends. \u00a0It's unpretentious, easy, and relaxing. \u00a0It's also a great place to hit before or after a movie at the AMC across the street. \u00a0  A few things to note: \u00a0this is not a great place for WHEELCHAIRS. \u00a0 While the front door IS accessible, the bathroom may not be the easiest to get to through the packed diningroom. \u00a0The back diningrooms are accessible via a side door, so that IS an option. \u00a0The owner and her family will bend over backwards trying to make it all work for you. \u00a0That's how they are. \u00a0But it still isn't the easiest. \u00a0However, if you aren't planning to use the bathroom or have a smaller chair it IS do-able and worth it.  My two favorite things on the menu? \u00a0The corned beef (*DROOL*) and the buffalo chili! \u00a0The latter is hearty, meaty (made with buffalo, so healthier than regular chili), a little spicy, and served over rice...delish!! \u00a0  If you're having a special ocassion here (birthday party?), they won't charge you a cake fee. \u00a0And they'll bring you plenty of plates, forks, and a knife with which to cut your cake. \u00a0That's just how they are...super-nice, helpful, and not trying to nickel and dime you!! \u00a0I have a feeling that good attitude is a big part of why they've stayed in business for so long in a city that is increasingly inhabited by food snobs (myself included!).  Wow, just talking about Tommy's makes me hungry....!!!!",

I got their Sunday special which was the beef burgundy. The flavor was all there, BUT the meat was dry and kinda tough. I wish it would have melted in my mouth in any sort of way. It came with a bed of rice and a roll.   We also tried their buffalo chili, which was pretty darn good considering we love our chili with raw onions and cheese on top! This one didn't have any of that, but came out tasting great. Can't say there was a big flavor different with the meat. This also came with a roll.   Maybe we need to try some other things like their sandwich?   Overall, we got our food instantly and service wasn't too bad, I even asked for more pickles since they had a pickle bucket out that didn't have any left, not so bad. CASH only, they do have an ATM machine there if needed.",

I guess she hasn't eaten here in a very very long time, because I was not impress with the food. It was dry and tasteless. Had to put hot sauce to get more flavor out of the corned beef, and added more salt and pepper into the mashed potatoes and tomato salad.  The environment reminded me a dive bar slash hole in the wall restaurant with a Friday's feel to it, with all the memorabilia they placed on the wall. With the cafeteria style in getting your food and watching the servers serve your choice of slivers of meat felt like flashback to my elementary days, when the lunch lady would say, \"What ya want to eat?\" Just thinking about it gives me the willies. So I guess it's a fair trade. Cheap food + cheap prices= diarrhea!!!  It's like the saying, you get what you pay for.",

But I was curious about eating some buffalo meat. So my excuse was that my brother was visiting SF and that we needed to try and eat some place new.   We decided what we wanted to order and waited a while for the guy to actually ask me what I wanted. It was all about the buffalo stew sandwich for me while my brother got the turkey and a side of mashed potatoes to share. I carried the tray to a small table near the back and after ordering our drinks, dug in. I had to eat the sandwich with a fork and knife. Now that I think about it, a stew sandwhich is about the sloppiest thing you could ever eat. But it was damn good. I tasted some of the turkey which was also really good, cut straight from the bird and not some crappy cold cuts. The mashed potatoes were all right.  This place has its charm and the food is pretty good if all you wanna' eat is MEAT. It gets pretty crowded in there and I had like three people shove their rude ass ways in the door, hitting me without so much as an \"excuse me\". The waitress only checked on our table twice, once to get our drink orders and once to give us our drinks.   This is a place you need to eat at least once. Also... Metallica used to hang out here.",

This, being the first time after roughly nine months of cruising by the establishment on Van Ness, was ready to reap my expectations at their most fantasmic glory. Tommy's was everything I was hoping for and everything I've been told it was. A meat lovers paradise. Beef, pork, poultry, and lamb rule the focus of the down home, comfort aligned menu.   We slipped in the door and were lucky enough to be faced with an empty serving station. Nobody standing there to block our view of the totally attractive and not to mention juicy looking \"rounds\" of meat. We're talking meat here folks. Not some sissy serving of baby pigeon sauteed al dente in a bed of virgin rose petals, but stick to your ribs, no none sense eats.   After perusing the selections I chose the Corned Beef and Cabbage and my wife chose the BBQ'd Turkey. Both servings were very very large. The Corned Beef was awesome however the steamed cabbage was ok but I've had better. In fact, the meal would of been perfect if they could just cook the cabbage with a little southern flair.   Wash your food down with something from their well stocked bar and you will agree you made the right choice in stopping by Tommy's Joynt. While you're sitting there munching down on this most enjoyable meal look around. Take in the ambiance of Tommy's place. It is truly unique and needs some time from you so you can take in the entire collections of stuff they accumulated over the years. Hell, I'm going to bring something from home and give it to them just so I can have a piece of me in Tommy's.   Try Tommy's out folks, you will not be disappointed.   Cptsparkle",

I quickly stuffed my Jewish American Princess hat in my purse and ponied up to order food. I was glad I had brought a little cash with me as I didn't realize it was a cash only establishment that was very bar heavy and full of a different sort of mix of people doing the evening drink and cheap food thing.   I ordered the turkey leg dinner and it came with mashed potatoes, stuffing and gravy and a roll. The daughter had a brisket dinner with green beans, mashed potatoes and a roll. The mashed potatoes tasted like the boxed kind, the stuffing was meh, the turkey leg tasted like it had been made and reheated and well, I didn't like my meal much. The daughter's on the other hand was great-brisket that was moist and tender and seriously delicious. I would have this again.

I have gotten the dinner plate a couple times but the bread that the sandwiches are presented in is really good, soft and warm and chewy, delish! Also it's dirt cheap.

Now being with a group of people you have to sample what everyone else got, right? So I will say the bbq beef sandwich was very good and part of me wished I had got that one instead. The ham was excellent, but the turkey...are you ready? The turkey was dry, not like dry, but like dry as a desert. I was pretty disappointed with the turkey and I wasn't the one who ordered it and had to deal with it. Perhaps they were having an off day.   This place is no frills, no fuss just a casual corner restaurant in San Francisco off the path of the tourists. I enjoyed being there and checking the place out. The staff was friendly, the service was good and the place was fun. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit there again, but if I found myself in the neighborhood I would stop for the bbq beef sandwich.",

But, I was brought up in the San Francisco Public School System, so I do know a thing or two about cafeteria food.  Tater tots, square pizza slices, and chocolate milk... that's what I'm talking about!! Okay, Tommy's Joynt might not have that on their menu. Instead they offer lamb shanks and buffalo stew among others.  This is a Manly Man spot. Just check out their website. If you want food fast, this is the place to go. If you want a fork, you better go get one yourself. If you want gourmet... go take a hike Frenchie!!   The food is no frills. I tried the buffalo stew and it was pretty good, tangy, but unfortunately, the meat was not gamey. I tried my buddy's lamb shanks. That was no frills as well with the lack of herbs on the shanks.  A major surprise was the Manhattan I ordered. This was one of the best I have ever tried. It had a great balance of bitters, alcohol, and sweetness for a delightful price of $5.50.  Yes, the prices at Tommy's Joynt is nice for the style of food that they offer. The food is not fancy, but pretty good on the hof-brau scale. So, I offer four Manly Man stars to Tommy's.",

We ventured back toward the direction of our hotel and saw Tommy's Joynt from across the street. We decided to get in and were a little confused at the whole ordering process at first, but we got it down. You order kind of like cafeteria style, then you pay and find a table. Oh, we came on a Sunday and came a little past 12:30, and there was no wait in line and plenty of seating available. Everyone in our group ordered the BBQ Brisket sandwich on a sourdough roll with different sides. I got the side salad with thousand island dressing. The sandwich came with a little cup of sauce. SO GOOD. The meat was so tender and there was so much of it packed into the bread. I was already sold at the sandwich, but then I had to go and see a little picture of this round man with spicy white hair.   For those who know me, I'm a HUGE Triple D (Diners, Drive Ins &amp; Dives) fan. I didn't realize Tommy's Joynt was featured on Triple D until I was about 3/4 through my sandwich. SOLD. SOLD. SOLD.

I ordered the pastrami / corned beef sandwhich and it was awesome; the meat is cut right in front of you and you can request end cuts of the meat too which i particularly like; the pastrami is deli style so dont expect a big greasy slop of meat strings but rather cuts like roast. You can mix and match any of the meats to make your own sandwhich. For the price it is well worth it, everything is a la carte except for the dinner specials. For a side i ordered the baked macaroni and cheese which was super heavy but delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to all the deli lovers out there who are looking for a quick bite to eat.

I was bummed I didn't notice the horseradish sauce on the table until I was 95% done with my meal. For the dinner sides, I chose mashed potatoes (with gravy) and the coleslaw. I highly recommend NOT getting the mashed potatoes since they are box-made, which was a big disappointment. The coleslaw, on the other hand, was light yet flavorful and I definitely recommend it if you are a coleslaw fan.  My friend got the BBQ brisket and I tried a few bites of it and will definitely come back to order that dinner. I also tried the meatball sub from a friend and was not impressed.

At $6, you can get any of their sandwiches, I think you would not be disappointed by the pastrami! \u00a0After all, according to the word of George Costanza, it is the most sensual of all the smoked meats!  The pastrami is so juicy and has this awesome blackened crust that is just beautiful and oh so tasty! \u00a0It even comes with a little dish of jus to dip in, but you don't need it the pastrami stands on its own.  I also got the clam chowder, which considering its San Fran, better be a good clam chowder. \u00a0It didn't disappoint, it was some good chowder. \u00a0I think the funniest thing on the menu is the turkey leg. \u00a0Basically a dinner plate with a large turkey leg as the protein. \u00a0It's just a really big turkey leg, like medieval times.  Also has a full bar available for all your alcohol and non-alcohol needs. \u00a0It's a small place with an airport type line to get to the counter to order your food, but it moves fast as the guys behind the counter are good at what they do. \u00a0But if it's real crowded, seating could be tough, but you can also sit at the bar to eat.

I do still like the vibe of the place and it hasn't changed in the 20+ years I've been going there... but now I only go to Tommy's to kill time before seeing a movie across the street at the AMC. \u00a0The main difference nowadays is that most of the patrons are tourists, many of whom are probably expecting to see Metallica dining next to them. \u00a0  On a recent visit prior to a movie, a tourist couple kept staring at my companions and I..

I simply told the staff associate to relay the message to the owner. It was months ago since I went there but I think my g/f had the brisket of some sort  Not sure i'll go back there b/c of this scare. Maybe it was a rare occurance but it did happen.",

The decor is random stuff and graffiti on the wall, and I think if you were a tiny person and could see the inside of a glockenspiel, that this is what it might look like. There is a barrel of pickles?!  This is not a wheelchair friendly place, the only bathrooms are up a whole bunch of stairs. There is a decent beer selection. The patrons are very diverse. Families with kids asleep at the table, couples, groups of men, groups of women, huge age range.   It's good and inexpensive, big portions, and not at all pretentious. The staff are all nice and friendly people. I looked into having my wedding rehearsal dinner here, but they said no groups larger than 30. They have a big upstairs area, but I appreciate that they didn't take on more than they thought was reasonable to handle.   It's a San Francisco landmark establishment for a reason. If you aren't vegetarian or vegan, and don't have a physical disability (or at least know you won't need to use a restroom), then it's probably worth checking out.",

My mom used to come here for pastrami sandwiches and beer back in the day.  We went in and stood in line to place our order. Cash only.  It was really neat to watch the men behind the counter create your meal in mere seconds! I ordered the turkey enchilada... IT WAS FLIPPIN' DELISH!  It was also quite big and I couldn't finish it. My boy cousins helped me finish it off and they said that it was really good, too.   We also had ordered the turkey sloppy joe, buffalo chili, beef brisket dinner, and a sausage sandwich. According to my cousin, the sausage sandwich could have been better considering it was a small sausage hidden between two huge pieces of bread. Other than that, everyone else agreed that it was a good meal.   I really enjoyed that enchilada and will be back to try the rest of the menu!",

GET the BBQ Brisket Beef sandwich on a sourdough roll. \u00a0It is juicy and tender. \u00a0The flavor is amazing.  The pastrami and corned beef are also amazing.  The round of beef (i.e. roast beef) is not good. \u00a0Do not get it. \u00a0It is too tough and flavorless to eat. \u00a0Now I understand why roast beef in deli shops are cut super thin - because it's tough. \u00a0And Tommy's cuts its meat thick and gives you a ton of it, which is A+. \u00a0They show you what true roast beef is. \u00a0But it just not a good meat in this situation (no fault of their own).

    "review_text": "Tommy's Joynt is a mecca of carving board sandwiches (most prominently the hand carved pastrami, and corned beef), and roast turkey and roast beef dinners with all the fixings. Originating in a time when home cooking was the only option for restaurants which operated under much stricter standards, Tommy's Joynt is part Jewish delicatessen, part old world diner, and part saloon. You can't ask for a more historic restaurant in San Francisco.   The pastrami and corned beef are from scratch and kept warm, and the roast beef and smoked turkey are slow roasted on premise, and all are carved from the brisket, bird, or roast to order. Also let's not forget the home made buffalo chili, available daily, or the fourteen different home made daily specials, a different selection each day, from lasagna to oxtails to braised lamb shank. Finally if you're in the mood for a drink, there is a twenty foot oak bar original to the space (meaning really, really old), with all the fixins for classic cocktails, a better than average liquor set, and a very, very impressive craft beer selection for such an old-school traditional place. Add in the classic early 1900's interior and vintage advertising all around, and you have one of the finest joints in all these United States.  Back in the earlier part of the last century there were lunch counters and full service delis all across America serving home cooked traditional standards like roast turkey and gravy, corned beef dinner, and hand carved roast beef. Sadly that old school traditional restaurant culture has been replaced with fast food drive-thrus and mass marketed corporate chain restaurants serving re-heated frozen foods. Troubling though that may be, we have places like Tommy's Joynt to remind us what we are missing out on, and hopefully they will lead us back to the old traditions once again.",

The lead based paint on the walls gives it even more qualifications as a Dive.   We sat at the bar for about an hour and a half before we ate. The specialty cocktail menu has the basics listed. We tried this Toms Rum Punch thing. To sweet for me, I only had one, my husband had about 4.   I then moved over to beer from there. They had Boddingtons on tap. It was served in a cool Bodingtons glass that I really wanted. My husband told me not to steal it.   Second beer I had was recommended from the bar tender. It was a beer from Kenya called Tusker. I liked it. It was light like a Red Stripe but had that full flavor of a New Castle. I really enjoyed it and would probably try and go find it at Bev Mo.   When we finally decided to eat food we gave up our well established seats at the bar and got into the line. Like cattle going to slaughter, we were just walking in zig zag form until we got to the front of the line to order.   We had a while to read the menu and I went with Corned Beef Dinner Plate with Veggies and a side of Tomato Salad. The Veggies were grayish green colored Green Beans. Obviously canned.   The meat was very good. I saw them bring over a big piece of Corned Beef right before it was our turn so I knew it was fresh. There was no cabbage it was straight Corned Beef.   The Tomato Salad was very, very good. I was worried about the large tomato slices being to hard like some large tomatoes can get. They were crisp and good and had full tomato flavor. The only part I could have done with out was the Green Bell Pepper. This was something I could see my Grandma make for a family get together.   My husband got the Kielbasa Sausage Sandwich with a side of Clam Chowder. His Clam Chowder was way to fishy smelling for me, like low tide. He said the Kielbasa was good. I should have taken a bite but I was to consumed with my own food.   This place is definitely not worth 4 or 5 stars. Its unique and pretty cool but the food was mediocre and the drinks were average.   If you haven't been go so that you can say you did. Other than that I would probably go to a nice sit down place for a lovelier meal.",

No, you won't get the pampered treatment of a 5-star restaurant...you WILL get chunks of potato salad and coleslaw dumped onto your plate and you will have to find your when seat.  Think mid 20th-century American dining...plaid striped table cloths...wooden tables and seats...guys with aprons behind the counter serving you...and then the bar.   Finding this place is not that hard...you will not miss it by its exterior...think of a building all \"tattoo'd\" up and you will get Tommy's. And once you get inside, there will most likely be a bit of a wait as your order and pay on the spot (all one line). Once you order, you can find a table/seat either on the first or second floor.  Based on yelp reviews, I decided to try the Buffalo Stew Sandwich ($6.95). You basically choose your own bread (Whole wheat, Sourdough, Rye) and they dump a whole lot of stew + meat onto it. Just how I like it. It was surprisingly filling. I came with a group of 5 and everyone ordered something different, I especially enjoyed the BBQ Brisket.   If you are ever in the area whether it be on a Friday/Saturday night before going out, I'd highly suggest you hit Tommy's Joynt up...it's definitely one of the better restaurants around in that area.",

At night I may have to wait a solid 30 minutes for one of those bastards so I head into Tommy's for a shot. Well, maybe two shots at such a nice price. Who says you have to spend the entire time standing on the curb awaiting the damn bus? I say that's time for shots!  Or you could always go to the Korean bars down the road and let them rape your wallet for $7 or $8 a shot *cough* Hanaro &amp; Outsider *cough cough*. Me? I'll take my treat for $4 at Tommy's.",

I knew about the dated decor and even the cash only thing (even though I think that's rediculous in this day and age). I didn't. I ordered the Sunday Special, Beef Burgandy with rice. Can't go wrong with the special, right? WRONG! Firstly, it looked like slop thrown on the plate, sauce dripping off the plate (ick!) and there was A LOT of it, big portion of inedible food. It was so not even similiar to any beef burgandy I have ever tasted anywhere in the world. For some people that is welcome, a quirky take on a classic. Just plain not good. At all. Period. My daughter got the brisket plate with mashed potatoes. Again, a large portion. The meat itself was very tender &amp; tasty. Unfortunately the BBQ sauce that was (again) slopped all over the plate, inncluding the potatoes, was syrupy sweet. The potatoes were not too good with the sauce on them. Gravy would have been better. My husband had the turkey plate with mashed potatoes and dressing with gravy and really liked it. His turkey was really good and again, nice size. My mother-in-law had a corned beef sandwich and enjoyed it very much as well. It was a Suday around 1:00 PM, only 3 people in line ahead of us and the restaurant was quiet. Good timing because as we were driving away we saw at least 20 people waiting, many of them outside. I understand this is a neighborhood stand by, but I was less than impressed and will not go back. My companions might. I guess you'd have to try it yourself, just don't expect much. i see many reviews talking about how cheap it is; I'd rather pay more, get less food that is GOOD food.",

They're cash only, but there's an ATM there. Service isn't wonderful, but it's what you'd expect. This is one of those places where once you bite into the food, everything else about the place just starts making sense.

The outside was pretty cool looking. \"The Original Tommy's Joynt\" put a bit of old fashioned flavor into the restaurant. There were also memorabilia in there too. Pictures, posters, cut outs, frames of certain crafts, everything. It put a feeling of being in a European restaurant since it had dark lighting and everything around me was made of wood. The meat carver was a nice guy. I asked him which sandwich to get; the corned beef or the round of beef, and he said the corned beef.   We received our order right away and they cut the meat right in front of you. I dipped a corner of the sandwich into the gravy and took a bite. It was soft and the meat required no excessive chewing at all. The meat was full of flavor and tender. We also ordered an Irish coffee. It was a bit expensive and for me, it was a bit too strong. Maybe that's because I haven't really had too much experience with alcohol.   The food was great. The service was friendly and quick. I'm gonna come back again and try their round of beef sandwich. Tommy's gives you a homely feeling. I really like the decors and seating. Glad I came back home to try it.",

Add horseradish and spicy mustard, yum! The pickles are the BEST!   This review is really about thanksgiving. My love and I were here to grab an actual thanksgiving dinner since we had a non traditional meal before hand. It was like $14 for an entire thanksgiving dinner. Which fed the both of us and we took some home. The turkey was good!!!!!!!!!! Let me tell you, I am not a big fan of turkey but it was so good and not dry. So the actual dinner came with turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy. Also a side or salad, bread roll, cranberries and a pumpkin pie with tea or coffee. It was worth it. I might come back every thanksgiving. So if you decide to do that also, you won't be the only one. The line was extremely long and the bar was full. However, the line went by faster than I thought.

You can grab a dinner plate with carvings of your particular meat, which is normally a generous portion. The carvers are good about trying to cut away the fatty portions. The meats are normally lean and melts in your mouth.  I've tried the Ox-tail and it was very sweet, so be warn before you order. I liked it, but my friends were not as satisfied.  They have a huge variety of beer from around the world and different versions of the typical Irish coffee.   Service is amazing and quick. Remember to use the tray just for transporting your food, because a server will swing by and grab those trays immediately.  D\u00e9cor feels like a dining hall or sports bar with its all wooden interior and a mix between booths and picnic style tables and chairs.

Part Two: Make your friend act like a volcano twice!  Suppose you have a friend who likes potato salad and he's really sensitive to spicy food.  Tommy's Joynt puts jars of sinus-blasting prepared horseradish (not the weaker creme of horseradish stuff) on all the tables.  Said friend likes to prattle on about miscellanea and at the crazy crap on the walls.  While he goes on and on, suppose you hide a big glob of horseradish in the potato salad, where it remains practically invisible as the horseradish, the potato salad and the plate are all white in color.   Now suppose he eats the potato salad containing the horseradish.  You may just see your friend imitate a volcano.  As he wipes up and buries his face in a napkin, wiping sweat off his brow, you can take a big scoop of hot mustard from another jar (it says \"Hot Mustard\" on it) and put it in the gravy-filled crater in his mashed potatoes that come along with the BBQ Turkey Sloppy Joe (perhaps one of the best Calorie per dollar values in SF).  Now suppose you recommend he cools the fire of the horseradish with the rich blandness of the potatoes and gravy.  If you've played your cards right once again, he won't see the mustard because it's a very similar golden-brown shade as the gravy, especially in the slightly dim light, and he'll be imitating a volcano again.",

So I pretty much believe anything and everything the food network and travel channel tell me, so when a local sensation pops up, and the BF and I happen to catch it - WE ARE ON IT!   The first time we went, it was around 3PM we found parking on Van Ness a block down. SCORE!   We get inside, and its like Harry's but way cooler, there are a bunch of tables everywhere - and you pretty much sit with strangers, the bar is right there with probably 100 different beers in bottles and FAT TIRE on TAP! SCORE!!!   We order, one roast beef sandwich and one pastrami sandwich - served on the most amazing roll probably sourdough but maybe sour!   We go take a seat. Next to another couple, not like directly next to them - 1 seat in between each of us as were across from each other. The other couple ordered everything Tommy's could possibly offer! But little did we know, they were loaded! Like high off pills, maybe crack - who knows they were falling asleep in their mashed potato's and corn! It was so entertaining.... (that's pretty bad - had to be there)   Anyway, back to our food, Paul ordered the roast beef and I ordered the pastrami - Paul is lucky I agreed to give him half of mine if he gave me half of his! My PASTRAMI WAS GREATNESS!!!!!!   His roast beef was Good - Not GREAT! But good, I love horseradish, and had I remembered to put it on there I bet it would have been better!   Oh and check out the jug of pickles! They are homemade and yummy!   We have been back, random jet to the city and this time Paul orders the pastrami!

My boyfriend had the bufflo stew (really good) and I had the turkey leg (good but kinda on the dry side, which is odd since it's dark meat).   I would definitely return again, but would want to try something else.",

    "review_text": "I've always wanted to come and sample their meats even before Guy Fieri featured this establishment on his show, \"Diners, Drive-in and Dives\"! And the moment I walked in, I can see the buzz about this casual and comfortable dining experience!  First thing that hits me wasn't the food, but rather the environment, which is littered with all kinds of antiques and pictures! I heard they have a crazy selection of beer and after walking in, look around and you might spot a wall of bottle to choose from!  Now this isn't a typical sit-and-be-served restaurant. In fact, it's more like a cafeteria type deal. Stand in line and choose from the menu and the meat masters will carve your plate or sandwich. I came with my wife and she got a BBQ Beef sandwich. For myself, I had to try their Brisket!   After paying for your meal, you'll need to find your own table. Tricky, but there will always be a seat for you. Water is self-serve, but sodas and beers can be ordered by their friendly staff that goes around to make sure everything is okay.   Food time! My Brisket was smothered in BBQ sauce, but one thing that I would try is to have the beef juice instead. The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy and compliments the juicy Brisket well, but the juice would probably take the natural beef flavor out! My wife's BBQ Beef sandwich was tender, but it needed some sauce to moist it up a little more to make it easier to chew on.   Overall, I do see that Tommy's Joynt is a great place to have a meal or a beer. You'll find that there is a lot to explore here in terms of food and all the fun pictures and history that they have around the place, so no matter where you sit, there's always something to look and talk about.",

    "review_text": "Darn. I expected so much coming to this restaurant. My sister's boyfriend wanted to get some good protein and strengthening food the night before his meet so I found Tommy's Joynt, being hopeful of a large meal and a lot of meat.   I was thoroughly surprised when we walked in and it was all on a booth. It was like a serviced buffet, but not really. You walk in, tell them what you want.. They cut you the \"large\" (but kind of not that much) portions, routinely dump the sides on your plate, and serve you whatever or however they want. The large glass window barrier that you have to talk behind is difficult to communicate with, but yeah..  The food in itself was interesting. I got the bbq brisket which was quite tender and the meat was very easy to cut through and tear apart. They call it bbq, but you can choose whatever sauce they have. I feel like I should have chosen a different kind since I'm not TOO fond of barbecue sauce. But be warned, once you say you want it, the sauce goes all of your plate. Including over your mashed potatoes. Poop. The potatoes are smooth, kind of reminds me of kfc almost. ONLY kind of. I just think the plate of \"bbq brisket, mashed potatoes, bread, salad\" was not worth the amount of money we paid. That's all.  The salad was drenched in dressing so about five minutes into the meal, it gets real soggy and just soggy salty lettuce. Which I'm sure many people like....  We sat in the booths towards the back of the restaurant which are not for tiny people. Even for me, it was kind of tight... the tables very close up to your chest and all. Anyway, I honestly think the meal had been ruined by the unfortunate placement of the \"no parking\" signs just outside the restaurant. You shouldn't put a freaking sign that says no parking (at whatever times) right behind a tree. SF police... honestly... just looking for an excuse to make money : / as sad as that sounds.  Anyway yeah, we were rushed out of our meal just 15 minutes after we had started to eat... poop. Parking tickets suck.",

Brought together all of the elements so that we could share in this San Franciscan treasure? \u00a0  I took my first bite and the taste evoked such strong memories of public school cafeteria food that for a moment I could've sworn it was 1985 all over again. \u00a0The turkey was dry, the gravy was bland, and I don't think there was one grain of seasoning used on that entire meal. \u00a0I used the last 5 minutes of my lunch break to make a bowl of instant oatmeal and it was 100 times better than anything that came out of Tommy's. \u00a0My husband said his sandwich was ok but we're both clear on the fact that we'll never darken their hallowed doorway again.  But honestly, what I got was exactly what one should expect from a place like this; steeped in nostalgia and luring in the masses with promises of a meal under $10 in a city where that is surely a rarity. \u00a0And despite the rave reviews on both television and the internet that made me hope against hope that this place was different, deep down I knew that going in. \u00a0And now so do you.",

The cookie was good, though!  The atmosphere is kinda weird. There's a bar there with a bunch of men watching sports and drinking, probably not the best place to take a kid, but whatever.

My friend told me she once ordered the cheese sandwich and she received a slice of cheese between two pieces of bread. \u00a0In other words, plan on getting meat in one form or another.  Tommy's has a full bar and impressive beer and drink menu. \u00a0They'll gladly make you any kind of silly tropical drink or spiked coffee and I feel their prices are rather inexpensive. I specifically liked it when Jay was behind the bar. \u00a0He, like all of Tommy's staff are so nice!  Another tip about Tommy's Joynt: \u00a0It is one of San Francisco's best places for people watching. \u00a0You'll never find a better spot that brings so many different types of people together! \u00a0Between their steady elderly clientele, the locals who come in to watch sports (I was at Tommy's Joynt when the Giant's won their 2nd to last World Series game. \u00a0The place exploded!) and visiting tourists, Tommy's is a revolving door of interesting characters that give a good representation of SF's population. \u00a0Well, meat eating population...",

Fellow Yelper Tom R and I were still hungry after having brunch at a nearby restaurant so we decided stop by Tommy's to see what they're all about. The restaurant is partially a lunch line steamed table hof-brau combined with a sport bar and heavily decorated with sports memorabilia and an impressive collection of empty bottles and cans to fill the antiquated wooden d\u00e9cor from floor to ceiling. The place was crowded and festive all around, and we were expected to share a table with a few others with plenty of eyes glued to two big TV screens with Cal playing Duke in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.  Tom was very gracious to treat me to a bowl of Buffalo Stew ($7.95) which came with generous chunky buffalo serve in a savory stew covering a soft bed of white rice underneath. The meat and the bread that came on the side were dry after it's been heated all day, but the savory sauce was tasty to combine with the rice to hit the spot. It was a solid round of comfort food and the rest of the menu that included the likes of sandwiches, salads, clam chowder, sausages and desserts are affordable and accessible for locals and tourists alike. From what I've seen on other people's plate, portions were very generous all the way around.  Service was quick and responsive at the steamed table and the overall environment was very pleasant with a friendly crowd. I would definitely be interested in visiting them again whenever I'm in the Van Ness area. 3 stars for the solid experience.",

My boyfriend, being a huge Metallica fan, occasionally remarked on an interest in going to Tommy's whenever we were in the area. However, we would always forget or didn't have internet access to look up whichever Tommy's Hetfield and the boys would nosh at. Thankfully our hostel had free wifi, so we Yelp'd that shit.   But yeah, they give you A LOT of food with your choice of meat, whether you want mashed potatoes or vegetables, beans or salad (I don't really recommend the potato salad, especially if you got mashed spuds on top on that, as the tater salad is pretty bland), and a big sourdough roll with butter. The rolls were great for soaking up juices from the meat.   The boyfriend couldn't help but head upstairs and take a quick picture of the bathroom where James, Lars, and Kirk told Jason Newsted he was in, following the death of previous bass player Cliff Burton.

So you guys are paying for everything, right?\n  The movie was sold out, so we decided to go to eat at Tommy's Joynt. The line was ridiculous. But it moved quickly enough. My eyes glazed over, and I was seeing red - pasta sauce, pickled beets, meats meats meats. I didn't know what to order. The buffalo stew is delicious, I know that. I've had their bratwurst before. Mmm! I ended up going for rack of lamb, with small boiled potatoes, served in a very salty gravy sauce. I got a side order of pickled beets, and my housemates ordered me a Sierra Nevada. They each had martinis, from which I ate all the olives. I smiled happily. The lamb was so tender and very salty and I ate a whole lot of it. Both of my housemates ordered burgundy beef, which was also quite good.\n  The best part about Tommy's is the crowd. There was a couple there with a wailing child. The mother looked barely older than the kid. She had a distinct Slavic accent. The father was this balding, much older man, with a bit of a beer gut and thick glasses. He was distinctly American. The wife spoke to the kid sternly, \"Zet is vy you should never hev children - zey vill be like you!\" (Awesome!). She didn't look happy to be there. I said, in a hushed tone, \"You guys, I bet you anything that she's a mail order bride.\" Here she comes to this country, thinking life will be magical, and ends up married to some fat shlub who takes her on romantic outings to Tommy's Joynt, with its beer flags and license plates and deer heads tacked up on every possible surface.

I think I've probably driven by this place a thousand times and never really noticed it before. \u00a0I only went because my brother knew about it and of course he knew about it because he's a guy in his mid-twenties and loves hearty food. I've been to Harry's Hofbrau in Santa Clara and Foster City numerous times, but it's so much easier having one in the city.  I ordered the corned beef and it includes mashed potatoes or veggies and a side salad, plus bread for $8.50. Yeah, not too bad, huh! I wish they had cabbage with corned beef though and it was salty, as corned beef usually is. There was more than enough food, and I didn't finish. We were lucky that when we went, there were about 3 people ahead of us...I think the line soon went out the door.  Just be advised, they only take cash, so make sure you have enough! They also have a full service bar up front, which looked pretty crowded with the basketball game on the flatscreen.",

I've seen this place a million times while on the 38L down geary but I hadn't ever been in because Van Ness is never a destination for me. My friends decided to come here tonight though and I happily walked down from Japantown to check it out.  Cheap (but *cash-only*) hauf brau style food? Awesome. And an extensive bar too? SWEET. All my okie/texan roots were showing for sure, and it helps that I am pretty enthusiastic about food from the german culture as well.  I had the polish sausage sandwich and a side of cucumber salad which tallied up to a grand total of $6.02. Pretty good. I wish I could have gotten the mashed potatoes but I have been trying hard to at least attempt to eat more of my green vegetables. Both were pretty satisfying, not particularly fancied up, but basic and good. Although now that I am at home, I'm pretty sure I had too much cucumber salad, cause my tongue hurts...and my love-hate relationship with all things vinegar'd and pickle'd continues.  In a city that often caters to foodies and the hyping-up of traditional cuisines and fusion foods (which also drives price and snooty-ness levels through the roof) it's nice to know that down to earth places with character are still alive and well.",

    "review_text": "Tommy's Joynt is about the experience. It's one of the oldest and most beloved restaurants in San Francisco, a place that my grandparents used to enjoy eating at. The Hofbrau set up is a bit unorthodox in this day and age but I dig it. Don't be discouraged by the line, it moves quickly. All you have to do is wait in the queue, come up to the hot food counter, pick your meal and have it placed on a tray, gather your own utensils, find your own table, and dig in. The only wait staff you will see are the cocktail waitresses, who circle around for your convenience.   The decoration is very nostalgic with dive bar and old school sensibilities. A no frills time warp that's clean enough to feel comfortable dining in. The tables in front tend to fill up fast so your best bet is to travel upstairs if you don't want to sit next to strangers. They're open late, they've never run out of anything I've wanted, and there are usually some prime people watching opportunities.   While no one will be giving them a Michelin star any time ever, they dish up classic American comfort food that caters to carnivores. This place is always crowded so there is great turnover. They serve a variety of sandwiches, dinner plates, and sides at extremely affordable prices and in huge portions. The BBQ brisket and corned beef dinner plates are main attractions and the pastrami sandwich is your safe bet. I particularly like the horseradish and the hot mustard in terms of condiments. The hickory baked beans and mac and cheese sides are standard by themselves but \u00a0tasty when you combine them. The salads are not their specialty but the one with cucumbers in apple cider vinaigrette is decent. Definitely get a complimentary, housemade pickle to go with your meal, especially if you get a sandwich.   If you're looking to hang out here for awhile, the alcoholic beverage offerings are a must. They've got bottled beers from all around the world, cheap pitchers, and fairly strong mixed drinks. The house margarita is unbeatable in terms of bang for your buck. Getting your own drinks from the bar is far superior to ordering from cocktail waitresses because they urge you to pay on the spot so unless you happen to have exact change, chances are you could be waiting awhile for them to come back.   Don't forget to bring cash and a serious appetite.   Side note, the erotic novelty dispensers in the bathrooms are ridiculous!",

Your meal is rounded off with your choice of salad or beans; mashed potatoes or veggies; and a roll to make such carnivorous consumptions conscionable. All for the low price of $9.

I was indeed the person who called the Health Dept. as he'd rightfully guessed. My illness was just wretched. I wanted to make sure no one else had to experience the same. The owner reconfirmed my suspicions that the plate of sliced dill pickles I consumed was most likely the culprit. I'm not sure how I missed the public pickle barrel on my previous visits. Apparently since the place opened they've had a huge barrel where anyone could reach in and \u00a0grab themselves a pickle. Our visit was late on a Saturday night and I was informed that many people over the course of Thursday, Friday and Saturday had used the barrel. Tommy's apparently provides tongs or something as a suggested method for pickle procurement but it's only a suggestion not a hard and fast rule. Our waitress had gone into that public barrel and sliced up a couple pickles for our table.   Anyway, it boils down to contaminated pickle juice...  No matter how cool Tommy's is I just haven't returned and never will. That week and a half was just the absolute worst. With the loss of my work week, the doctor's visit and some necessary dry cleaning, the cons just outweigh the pro's for me on this one. If you go to Tommy's have a great time, just stay the heck away from the pickle barrel.",

Well, Tommy's Joynt is the exact opposite of that. The interior of this place makes you think the entire joynt is out of place in the golden gate city, and rather belongs somewhere in one of those industrial states like Michigan or Wisconsin; the place inundated with charming old-timey beer posters, possibly dating back from the Cold War or the Vietnam war era, reminiscent of one of those cafeteria-style restaurants you frequently see on the Travel Channel that Adam Richman often heralds as \"meccas of comfort food.\" Tommy's serves comfort food that ubiquitous to every American city, state, region, you name it: barbecue sandwiches, brisket, mashed potatoes, collared greens, baked salmon... the list goes on. So sad to say, Tommy's Joynt wasn't exactly the \"San Franciscan\" restaurant I was looking for, but they meet every expectation of what comfort food should be.  As for the actual culinary experience itself, I got the \"dinner set\" with tender brisket and steamed green beans, accompanied by a side of macaroni salad and sour bread. The brisket simply melts in your mouth and the steamed green beans crumble with every chew--I would even venture to say all the food here is \"just how my grandma made it\" if not for the fact that my grandma spent most of her younger years in Japanese-occupied Korea, and that she hated (god rest her soul) American food with a flaring passion. The sour bread was a little hard to bite into, but I guess it's really meant for picking little chunks apart and dipping it into the homemade barbecue sauce they serve the briskets with.  I'll have to agree with my fellow yelpers in that the portions here are very generous and the prices here are beyond reasonable; my entire lunch cost me only 8.99 plus tax. Although I didn't get anything from the bar, they do have very reasonable happy hour prices for beer from the tap (I think it was something like 2.75) and if the posters can be held as a credible source, they apparently have Carlsberg on draught here.  for all you tl;dr's: Tommy's Joynt gets 3-stars for the actual food itself plus one star for portions and price.",

    "review_text": "Tommy's Joynt on Geary and Van Ness has been welcoming strangers since the mid-1940s, with a sign hanging over the front door to prove it. Located on a busy thoroughfare, Tommy's Joynt has long beckoned tourists, but unlike most tourist traps it's a local institution as well. You're as likely to engage in conversation with a solitary spry septuagenarian regular as you are to meet a young couple visiting from Spokane trying to decipher the extensive beer list.  Viewed from the outside, with a line snaking out the door, Tommy's Joynt can seem a bit daunting at first glance and a little chaotic. It's neither. People line up for the hofbrau carving station where veteran carvers serve up fresh turkey, barbecued brisket, lamb shanks, ham and buffalo stew, to mention a few. If the line seems a little onerous, simply veer left, walk past it and belly up to the bar, where you can order a beer while the rush subsides, as it invariably will. Once you're able to order your food, you can bring it to the bar until around 6 p.m. By no means is the food \"gourmet\" and some of the sides are more than a little sad, but it's affordable, fresh, tasty and hearty. Hofbrau food like brisket and roast turkey matches perfectly with beer, and Tommy's Joynt has the usual suspects on its dozen taps - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Anchor Steam, Sam Adams Lager and Guinness - along with a few pleasant surprises, such as Trumer Pils from Berkeley, Speakeasy Big Daddy IPA and Chimay. You can find some winners among the numerous bottles, too, like Maredsous (Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV) and Leffe from Belgium; Old Peculier (Theakston) and Old Speckled Hen (Greene King / Morland Brewery) from England; and Franziskaner Hefeweisse and Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold, Gold Weisse and Dark Weisse from Germany. Very little, if anything, about Tommy's Joynt has changed over the years, and that's by design. Its Web site declares: \"While the City has been changing year after year, we remain steadfast in our opposition to change. We want things to remain the same because our founders established a reputation in San Francisco; a reputation that promises hot food and cold drink at a price that parries our atmosphere.\" As long as Tommy's Joynt continues to deliver on that promise, it will remain a valued destination for hungry tourists and locals alike.",

We saw the front of Tommy's Joynt with it's large, busy mural and thought it would be a good sandwich place to go to. Boy were we right!  There is a lot to choose from and the pricing was very reasonable. The big downer was there are no selections for vegetarians. My girlfriend primarily eats vegetarian but in a pinch (one or twice a month) she'll eat meat if she's having trouble finding vegetarian selections. I'm really glad she did this time because she ordered the CORNED BEEF SANDWICH and POTATO SALAD. Both were awesome! The Corned Beef was very lean and very tasty. The bread it was on was really good, too. We shared an order of the potato salad and it had lots of flavor.  I ordered the KIELBASA SANDWICH which was decent. The bread it was on was really \u00a0good and so was the mustard. For $3.25 it was a deal. I'd DEFINITELY recommend the Corned Beef over the Kielbasa, but if you're jonsin' for a sausage sandwich, this wasn't bad.  They had a full bar and a huge selection of beer. ALL PINTS ARE $4.50, and I LOVE it when a restaurant prices things that way.  You could tell it was a very popular place but they were able to churn through the customers pretty quickly. This is a place where \"Bang for your Buck,\" \"Lively and Unique Atmosphere,\" and \"Good Deli Food\" all come together.  If you're in San Francisco looking for good deli food and Tommy's Joynt is one of your considerations, I'd strongly encourage you to give it a shot.  Cheap. Great corned beef &amp; potato salad.

How it works: walk in and get in line. It might look intimidating but the line moves pretty quickly. Get a drink at the bar while in line and get some cash at the ATM, also in the line, since it's CASH ONLY. When you get to the front, order something from the piles of meat that they have.  I highly recommend the brisket dinner plate. Almost everything I've had here is delicious, but nothing compared to the succulent brisket here. Put some hot mustard on that and it is GOLD. Out of the meat dishes I tried, I would put brisket first, round of beef, pastrami, then corned beef. I usually love corned beef but sadly, their corned beef does not hold a candle to the brisket. Put any of these on a sandwich and it's delicious too. People tell me the turkey is good, and I have tried the Turkey dinner plate and the Turkey ala King (Gravy turkey stew over rice) but honestly, I don't know why I would get anything other than brisket here. They are good, but nothing compared to the Beef dishes.   Now that I'm done gushing about all the BEEF, let me get to the not so good part - I don't think any of their sides are amazing, with the exception of mashed potatoes. Tomato salad tasted like armpits and their macaroni salad was a bit too sour. Green beans are just regular soft green beans and their slaw isn't anything to write home about either. I guess the delicious free pickles make the sides forgivable.   TLDR; get the Brisket Dinner Plate with mashed potatoes. You can thank me later.",

    "review_text": "I decided to give this place another shot after seeing it on 'diners, drive ins and dives' w/ Guy raving about the roast beef. \u00a0So I got the roast beef sandwich on sourdough and potato salad.  Roast beef sandwich - great! \u00a0Roast beef was super moist and tender. \u00a0Could have had more flavor aka some salt. \u00a0Sourdough roll was super soft and tasted like it was baked within a couple of hours of me eating it. \u00a0Overall, a great sandwich at a very affordable price. \u00a0Now if they had made a delicious au jus sauce to dip this thing in, it would be the perfect roast beef sandwich! \u00a0Since it would add more flavor. \u00a0The flavor was good, it was just a bit bland thats all.  Potato salad - lots of potatoes (good thing for me) but way too bland and not good flavor.  I went to this place years ago when Borat was sold out across the street at the movie theatre and my friends and i needed to kill some time before the next showing started. \u00a0We came here, and I remember ordering the brisket plate with beans and a roll. \u00a0It was super dissapointing - the meat was dry? not good, the beans sucked, and the roll was not very good.  So, in conclusion, if you live or work nearby, I definitely think this place is worth going to for a quick lunch if you want a simple and satisfying carved sandwich. \u00a0Skip the sides.",

    "review_text": "I saw this on DDD with Guy Fieri (talk about a great job). Ok, it's funny I remember seeing this place in the past, but sometimes when you're younger, you're not paying attention, especially when you're not the one driving. The full scale mural outside is a clear indicator of what sets it aside from the rest. On the show, we learned that the meats are cooked for a long time, which gives a good flavor (yum for us).   We arranged to come here with friends on a sunday night for dinner (parking was a block away, on a side street- pretty easy). From the show, the line can get out the door, very easily. We were lucky, it wasn't as long as I'm sure it would be, during the week. Sunday was a good night to be there.  You choose your selections while you're standing in line (oh, the possibilities- daily specials, side orders, desserts @ $2.75, dinner platters @ $8.50). A regular in line was giving us recommendations on the food. All sandwiches are $5.50- your choice of bread- sourdough, wheat, white, or rye- roast beef/bbq brisket/corned beef/turkey/ham/pastrami. Excellent price for such good size sandwiches. You pay for the food after making your selections. Then you find seats. Kind of cafeteria style. A server then takes your drink order. The setting is like a pub with dark rich woods (plus it's dark inside too) and it's kinda like a teepee (with more seats upstairs). No booths upstairs, just tables and chairs, and you might have to politely say \"Excuse us\" to your neighbors because it's somewhat of a tight squeeze at some seats (depends). But for the most part, they understand.   We had the turkey and the corned beef- we both split it. Both were really good but the beef had more flavor. We sampled some of our friend's chili which was pretty hearty. Our other friend had a lamb chop or leg or something. We really liked the place and would definitely come back again for more cheap eats.",

Oh goodness. Ohhhhh goodness gravyyyy (which, by the way, they have a lot of.) You have one of the greatest holes in the walls EVER.  Again, the first stand out is just how affordable the food is. Hearty portions of good eats for about $4-$9. If you are a straight up carnivore, this place is heaven. All the meats, sausages, and sandwiches are beyond top notch. They will fill you up and you'll be mighty satisfied. The food here is just full of flavor. It's like cafeteria food to the next next NEXT level. Speaking of which, food is served up cafeteria style. No fuss, they just take your order, you pay, and you're good to go. Don't forget to see what daily specials they have. Awesome stuff ranging from ground chuck steak smothered in mushrooms, onions, &amp; gravy to braised oxtail pasta. Oh, also turkey legs. Turkey legs folks. Not sure that much else needs to be said about that.  The place is kinda sorta small, but it's not hard at all to find a seat in here. You're likely to find a seat right after your order. I believe the water is self-serve (that's what I did) and drink orders are taken by the waitress, so keep that in mind if you're getting confused at the food counter. Oh, and don't forget to order some brewage or one of their custom drinks over at the bar. Goes perfectly with the food. Aw yeah.  This place is a MUST if you want to get some serious chow on a low low budget. You will not be disappointed, trust. If you're going to complain at THESE PRICES.... mannn, take your complaining self over the Ruth's Chris or something. I need to free up a seat for my friend.  Man... I wish I was/I had been an 11 year old in the city.  Turkey leg.",

Parking was easy to find on a Thursday afternoon, can't speak to busier times. It's a little disorientating when you first walk in, but be patient and pick something off the menu that sounds good and you'll be just fine. Fun place for sure! 4 stars for atmosphere   FOOD: I had the Thursday Special Lamb Shank with Veg. Lamb was fall off the bone good, and you can choose between 1 or 2 shanks, I should have gotten 2 because it was that good. It was served with potatoes and carrots veg with a gravy poured over the top. Veg was cooked perfectly and gravy was about average. My buddy had the Pastrami sandy and said it was the best he ever had. Portions are bountiful and the price is such a value at $6.00 a sandwich.  SERVICE: It's self order deli style and the deli guys were cordial, there was a very picky lady in front of us requesting a few obscure items and they were very patient with her. Weird thing is you need to pay at the counter but order your drinks though the waitress? We didn't order beverages but it seemed a bit confusing? \u00a0Our waitress nonetheless was accommodating and friendly. 4 stars for service  OVERALL: Great place for some good grub.

He left and another guy came out a minute later and asked again. My bf asked why they want our trays and they said it was policy to take trays...I thought it was rude. They had MANY trays and I saw a couple that was seated and had their food set by the same guy that told us it was policy to take trays!!! Really annoying. Minus one star.  I originally wanted the BBQ beef but saw the brisket and took that instead. After they set my plate I saw the BBQ beef and regret my order. So my bf took it.   The brisket was good. But the BBQ was flavorful. Both were tender but of course the BBQ was more tender.   The mash was good the gravy could be worked on.   I took the potato salad and my bf got beans. So fresh! The beans had a pickle taste to it so I didn't like it much.   The only thing I didn't like was the clam chowder. Way too thick and way too salty.  For all that food it was 23$ I believe.

    "review_text": "I've been in and around SF for the past 30 years and have always wanted to eat at Tommy's Joynt but have somehow never gotten around to it until today. Since I'm moving to Tennessee next month, I seized the opportunity to eat lunch there at 2:15 pm.  The outside is happily decorated with festive art work depicting food and patrons and is inviting enough. After my 30 minute visit, I can agree that a classy place it's not --- it truly is a Joynt, and a tired, rundown Joynt at that.  Upon entering this dimly lit establishment, I saw a long bar on the left with an impressive list of foreign and domestic brews. To the right, a Hof Brau style serving station. It wasn't very busy; only six folks sat at the bar and another ten were in the front dining room.  I ordered a pastrami sandwich and the meat looked terrific. The server cut several generous sized slices and then put them directly onto a plain French roll. No mayo, mustard, sauerkraut or anything -- just a plain roll with meat.   Now it's been said that man cannot live by bread alone, there must also be condiments. I got him to put some Swiss cheese on top, but that was it.   I moved to the next station and ordered a bowl of fruit and a diet pepsi.   To my dismay, the man who served up my fruit was also my cashier and didn't even stop to wash his hands. If that wasn't bad enough, I sat in full view of the serving line and for the 30 minutes I sat there eating my lunch, never once did this man wash his hands even though he was very much involved with the serving and plating of the food.  When I ordered my \"sandwich\" I was told that the \"waitress\" would bring my drink. Never once did she acknowledge my presence. I guess that's why she is called a wait-ress.  After eating, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and face and as I walked up the stairs, I was disgusted by the filthy carpet that very well could be the original carpet from 1947 when this place opened. They were dirty and had enough grease on them to lube a rental fleet at an airport.  The men's restroom was equally dirty. I don't think anyone has cleaned the corners of the floor in years. I guess no one here has heard of good old soap, water and elbow grease.  The pastrami was terrific, but everything else was a resounding thumbs down. At least I'll not be missing this place when I move eastward.",

I stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and first off, the atmosphere has a sweet antiquity like McSorley's in NY. \u00a0It's been around since 1947 so the walls and high ceiling (there's a 2nd floor in the back) are collaged with relics from Americana. \u00a0I got a Pastrami sandwich with chips and an Anchor Steam beer. \u00a0The sandwich comes with a little container of thin gravy which is amaaaaazing. \u00a0I kept pouring it in the sandwich with every bite, not to mention adding the zesty hot mustard available on the table. \u00a0The pastrami was good, pretty dry by itself thus the gravy, but plentiful and in a considerably thick roll which soaked up the gravy beautifully.  I came in another time w/ another friend pretty close to 2am and we had the drunk munchies. \u00a0Of course this is the PERFECT place for that. \u00a0This time we shared a sandwich w/ stuffing in a pool of gravy, and it was ridiculously satisfying, so much so that we got another order of the stuffing. \u00a0My friend was like \"uh oh, now that I know about this place I'm going to keep coming back on nights like this\"  Don't apologize for what you eat here, back it up with a fresh beer and kiss your biceps.",

There was no line at 7 which surprised me because I know it is pretty popular. I really wanted to try the buffalo sandwich but I tried the corned beef plate because it is so popular and I could also get mashed potatoes and baked beans. It was $10.04 after tax and that is pretty damn good for such generous portions of high quality food. The style here is order, pay, sit, and relax which I really enjoyed. I got to talk with my friend for a few hours and no one was trying to kick us out or bother us.  The baked beans were a little under cooked and the bread was a little hard but they both tasted good and rounded out the deliciously salty corned beef and nicely mashed potatoes with gravy.

Mel's Diner is directly across the street (and somehow even MORE flashy than Tommy's) but I hate Mel's and only ever go there if forced. While Tommy's certainly has its own degree of kitsch to it (the interior is a mix between a quirky neighborhood dive and a cafeteria), I'll take cheap meat and 100 imported beer options over bright flourescent lights and angry servers dressed as 50's sock-bop diner employees (see, you'd be mad too) any day.  The mistake I usually make when coming here is to order near the thrifty end of the menu--forgetting that the most expensive dinner item is only like 12 bucks! I end up only picking at my buffalo chili and rice, while I covet, and eventually borrow, bits of my friend's corned beef, mash potatoes and gravy. Be spendy here!

Good, good, I would want to hear more information as well. You're in for it then, because I got plenty to say about this Joynt.  Let me start off by saying that there is truly little I love more than good food, good beer, and good company. You'll have to supply your own company (or talk to yourself or whatever), but Tommy's Joynt has the good food and good beer covered.  I wrote in another recent review of mine that the Spanish 'meal' known as tapas are supposed to be small, cheap dishes so that one never drinks on an empty stomach. Tommy's Joynt genuinely is the closest thing I have found to an American tapas bar.  The way it works is you order and pay for your food at the counter, then take a seat and a server takes your drink order. Trust me, it's going to take you a good few minutes to decide what you want to eat, especially if it's your first time there. It's all laid out and prepared right in front of you, very much in the style of an old-world type deli. The prices are low and the proportions are large.   I've been to Tommy's Joynt a few times, and again just yesterday. In the past, my eyes have been bigger than my stomach and I ordered much more food than I could actually handle. I go by a general 1-item rule now. Yesterday, I had the kielbasa sausage sandwich and my girlfriend got the Monday special, which was braised ox tail with buttered noodles. The sausage sandwiches are a great idea: surprisingly simple, surprisingly cheap, surprisingly tasty, and surprisingly filling. The sauce that comes with the sandwich is what MAKES it. I'm no foodie, so my abstract description of it is syrup meets gravy meets a little gelatin? I probably made it sound weird, but believe me, it's fuckin' BOMB.  When we took our seats, we had a very charismatic server named Isabella who actually taught me how to eat the sandwich. I'm not the type to say, \"piss off, I eat how I eat,\" I will gladly take a reccomendation from someone of expertise on how to eat something, especially the way she went about it. Acting almost like she was my mother, she brought me a plate of pickle slices and a bowl which she poured the sauce in. She told me to pile pickles on top of the sandwich and dip it into the sweet and savory sauce. God DAMN was she right! I have seen the light now. I couldn't even eat the whole thing and it was like $3.25. Totally awesome, right? And that ox tail my girlfriend had was seriously unreal, I've never tried ox tail before and it was something you need to try to believe.  They have mac and cheese too. I LOVE mac and cheese.  I haven't even gotten to the beer! Their bottle selection is very extensive, and their draft selection is a respectable dozen. My girlfriend and I ordered a small pitcher of Trumer Pils this time because it's delicious and less filling. Pint prices are $4.50, which is ehhhh. Not bad, not great. The small pitcher was $13, and I think it was a good value. Not Zeitgeist cheap, but still a good deal.  I highly recommend checking this place out. Cash only, and they have an ATM .",

The Turkey Sloppy Joe was excellent. It had a lot of chuck of Turkey meat with a mild sweet sauce and mashed potato also came with it. It was a rather light dish( was perfect for a late dinner). In addition, not only the taste was very good but also it was only $4.95! \u00a0Can't beat that.  We also ordered buffalo stew. That was also delicious!  This restaurant was founded in 1947, I believe. It has quite interesting interior. I saw a poster of Asahi beer from maybe in 1970s,",

I have long been intrigued by Tommy's Joynt. First, it was the loud, colorful mural on the outside of the restaurant, a welcome splash of unabashed color amid boarded up buildings in the Tenderloin. Second, it was the scent--that sweet, sweet scent of BBQ meat wafting through the air as I walk down Van Ness after work. When the air is right, it smells like there's a cookout going on.   That scent caused a craving that could only be satisfied by actually stepping inside. Upon entering, I was transported into an old-timey cabin-tavern of sorts, complete with a jumble of framed photos and art on the wall. There's a bar and large, picnic-style tables right in the front, and booths for parties of 3 or more in the back. The menu is prominently displayed behind the counter where you order your food.   I knew from the scent that the food would be good--it was just a matter of narrowing down my choices! All options sounded hearty and, judging by the size of the meat-carving station, worth the money. I passed up the plates in favor of the beef sandwich. What a big, no-nonsense sandwich: the six or seven thick-cut slices of juicy, tender beef made me question my choice of flimsy whole wheat bread. Good thing my sandwich was cut in half for me--just the sheer weight of the meat probably would have made the whole thing fall apart! The BBQ sauce was thin but flavorful; it came on the side so I could control how saucy each bite was. From start to finish, it was a great sandwich.   My boyfriend ordered the beef plate, which came with a little more beef than was in my sandwich, a hard dinner roll, and a couple of sides. Stick to the sandwich--it's quick, easy to eat, and highly satisfying!",

The sauce was like from a jar and the meatballs were just meatballs. Bold statement but I think I make better meatballs!!!  -Meatball Sandwich ($4.25): meh...bleh...the bf was not a fan. Same opinion as mine, he didn't like the sauce. He also didn't like the bread--he is big on bread!   If I remember correctly, both of us didn't finish our food...  Second Time (Eat-in): -BBQ Brisket of Beef Meal ($8.99): We both had the same thing. It came with a small salad, a side of mashed potatoes, and a dinner roll. 1) The Brisket of Beef-it was full of fat, especially the plate my bf got. For the parts we could eat, it was tender and tasty with the BBQ sauce. 2) Side Salad: Probably the best part of the whole meal because nothing was done to it! 3) Mashed Potatoes: Wow...not impressed. It tasted like something out of those ready-to-eat mashed potatoes mix you get from supermarket. The bf can make it better! 4) Dinner Roll: Please see my first sentence.  To be honest, I'm kind of intimated to order food here. The menu is one of those posted on the wall (not a fan) so you will have to order while standing in line . They were also scattered around on the wall and I felt pressure to order quickly.  Over all, I'm just not impressed. I would give the place 2 Stars if weren't for the booth table and the tasty meat smell I can sniff from outside.  Will i go back...that is a good question. Maybe third time's the charm?!",

Its always busy, which, if anything, adds to the thriving vibe of the restaurant. The decor is campy and tacky but in the best possible way. Strong A for ambiance, but the FOOD is what really makes the place. A+.   I really love the brisket, but everything else I've tried - ham, salmon, sausage sandwich - are phenomenal as well. Make sure to try the baked beans and potato salad! These are among my favorites, but it seems that you really can't go wrong at this place whatever you order.   If you're interested in the bar scene, this place is pretty solid as well. Not, most likely, somewhere I'd go just for drinks, but they've got a decent beer selection to accompany your heavenly meal.   Great place for a second date;) its a fun place, messy meal, and delicious food.   Highly recommended.",

I was driving around the city with my GF looking for late night drinks and food when we passed by Tommy's Joynt. I said \"F it, let's check it out\"...  The inside of this place reminds me of a bar you would see on Burbon St in New Orleans. Super old style bar with old style adds all over the place \"Hard boiled eggs- $0.25!\" which I love. Super nostalgic.   Now, don't expect culinary excellence when going to a place like this. You're going to get large portions of 'pretty good' tasting food for cheap, with the option of a full cocktail bar with a myriad beers from all over the world. I was starving and ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage plate with a Racer 5 IPA while my girl sipped a Strawberry Daiquiri. The food was great (admittedly I am easy to please, none the less)- Hauf Brau style, on a large plate with a roll. Delicious.  There were so many options, I didn't even know if I had chosen the right one. They had spaghetti and meatballs which looked great, mashed potatos, beans, soup, sandwiches, ribs.. the list is endless. I was however happy with my decision, knowing that I would be back to try more.  Best part: Full bar with food available until 1:40am every day.  Worst part: Cash only! However they did have an ATM  I highly recommend Tommy's Joynt.",

Ordered two meatball sandwiches, two orders of spaghetti and meatballs and two sides of mashed potatoes. Two Anchor Steams, one Stella and one Hefe. Drink total: About $17. Food total: Less than $5 a plate.  I had this memory in my head of Tommy's - I was about 7 years old, my grandma and an Irish family friend with an accent thicker than Tommy's marinara sauce. In my head the cafeteria style line went on FOREVER! In actuality it's got carving stations and a handful of other items - Sandwiches seem to be their deal. I remember seeing corned beef the other night and asking if they had sauerkraut - a Reuben sandwich stuck in my head. The cafeteria man said no and I opted for the meatball sandwich. Sauce is thick and creamy. Meatballs have either nutmeg or some sort of ingredient that throws you off a bit. But when you're faced with Mel's or Tommy's, you can get Mel's just about anywhere - Tommy's is worth the wait, longer than the cafeteria line!",

    "review_text": "Van Ness area is pretty dead on a Sunday night. One of the only bright spots is Tommy's Joynt, literally I mean with the flamboyant and colorful paintings all over the building (like one of the big breasted lady in Victorian attire who's about to eat a sandwich).. I'd have to say that I passed Tommy's hundreds of times without ever really thinking, \"hey what the heck is in there?\" I didn't even know it was a restaurant until last week.  So what brought me here during such a random time? I'm shamefully going to say that I had seen this place on the Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives.\" That show is ALWAYS on and after a few featured places they all start sounding the same. Guy keeps talking about how the meat dish is as big as his head or arm blah blah whatever. I wanted to see for myself.  We tried:  BBQ Sloppy Joe Turkey Sandwich with mash potatoes - I knew this was cafeteria style dining but I didn't expect the cafeteria tasting food. I seriously felt like I was back in elementary school. The taste was just so familiar; the meat tasted off... like it was sitting there too long and the only flavor came from the BBQ sauce. At first glance, it looks like you get a whole lotta meat between the two thick pieces of bread but then you dig down and see that they gave you an extra big piece of bread. What kinda sandwich has THREE pieces of bread?! And no, the big mac is a burger. I guess they just have to do that since they only charge $4.25 for the thing. Braised Lamb Shanks with vegetables (potatos and overcooked carrots)- I liked that it didn't have too much of the \"gamey\" taste lamb usually has but I felt like it also lacked flavor. The meat was also inconsistent with some parts being really dry.   I know this place is hella cheap so I wanted to like it. We only spent like $14? But just because it's cheap, doesn't mean it's going to be good. Food Network, you failed me!",

    "review_text": "Good ole' Tommy's. With the exception of letting Guy Fieri into your kitchen, you do little wrong.  A dive of a deli but an institution on the corner of Geary and Van Ness, The Original Tommy's Joynt dishes up heaps of homey comfort food, and a whole ton of meat, to the many diners who patronize it daily. If you're a fan of fresh carved deli meats, you're in luck. Come on over and get in line. I recommend the daily dinner platter versus the sandwich as the bread is really tough. Love the pastrami, BBQ brisket, and roast beef as my meat choices. They are all well-seasoned and delightfully moist. Pair them with simple but satisfying sides like mashed potatoes, macaroni salad, or mixed vegetables, you have a pretty substantial meal. Also, don't forget to check out the daily specials. I'm totally in if it's the fall-off-the-bone braised lamb shanks.   To top it off, there's a bar in Tommy's with a decent selection of brewskis to go with all that delicious meat. Been here pre and post drinking, and have equally enjoyed my food. It's an SF institution for a reason and I hope it goes nowhere as the neighborhood around it changes.",

    "review_text": "I feel a little silly giving Tommy's 2 stars but I am writing this review after my third visit there last night, so I did give it a chance. \u00a0  I totally understand why this place is prob the favorite place of alot of people...kinda that food that grandma and grandpa might have made back in the day and the spot has alot of culture to it...as someone else said the stuff on the walls looks like it has been there since the 50s.  They always have somewhat of a line..there is a little Disneyland style que set up to wait in. The menu and the way it is set up is really confusing for someone who has not been there before. \u00a0There is no real set menu that I could find (maybe I wasnt looking in the right place) and there are random signs all around with different dishes. \u00a0The guys serving the customers (its kinda like a cafeteria) are really good at what they do so they get people moving really fast through that line. \u00a0But that sucks when you have no idea what the dishes actually are and what they come with. \u00a0They seem annoyed with you if you dont instantly know what you want and seem even more annoyed if you cant understand what they are saying. (last night one of them had a think accent)  I am a simple person...if I dont know the food I am best with just regular stuff...maybe a good hamburger, fries, steak, ect...none of that here. Its all braised something or brisket of something thats all sitting out and looks like they marinated it overnight. \u00a0(Not in a bad way)  Now as I said this may be the bees knees for some people but not me...I think I ordered the BBQ Beef something thinking that it might be something like the BBQ I had in the past but the guy quickly sliced me up a bunch of pieces of meat and potatoes and slathered the whole plate with a gravy that tasted like regular BBQ sauce in like .2 seconds. \u00a0 The meat was between 25 and 50 percent fat...I am a meat eater but I dont eat straight fat. \u00a0I really had to pick apart the meat to get some regular non fatty stuff out of it. \u00a0I left a good portion of it on my plate.  The roll was yummy...it and the mashed potatoes saved my being hungry later.  Its a nicely cheap, fast dinner but there are two things that bugged me...and knowing me I am the ONLY person these two things bug.  Its small so you have to sit in long tables with other people...now I am a TOTALLY social person but when it comes to meeting total strangers over dinner I dont really go for that...  and  No free refills on soda. \u00a0  WHAT?!  Man what a bummer. \u00a0I understand a place has to make money but we all know how cheap soda is and practically every other restaurant nowadays has free refills. \u00a0  I know, I know I am going to get a bunch of people telling me I don't know how to eat or I don't appreciate Tommy's but I am just being honest, its not really for me.   That being said if a friend wants to go there for dinner, I have no problem going.   :0)",

Was meeting up with some friends here after woork so I was straight suited up in heels and when I walked in to wait for them I felt verrrry overdressed lol.

I have a new fetish for whipped cream vodka so any place with a full bar it happens to be the first thing I ask for. they were def more geared towards beers and dark liqours so the kind man put up with my 30 questions about types of vodka. Luckily they had rasberry grey goose so I was a happy camper. Friends still hadn't made it so I think the bartender felt bad for me cause my drink came out vodka with a splash of mixer. :) Now I was a very happy camper. \u00a0  Looking around the place reminds me of a cozy mountain bar like up in Trukee. Tons of stuff to look at. They have food there but I did not get a chance to try it, this might be a fun return opportunity.   Tv's everywehre but kind of tight spaces between the seating areas.

You then look for a seat and once doing so a waitress will take order for drinks. \u00a0Yes, you pay again - argh. \u00a0Our waitress was peculiar =P. \u00a0  This diner can get really busy, but people are coming in and out, so it's not too difficult finding a seat. \u00a0I see why Guy commends this diner--the howlie food is yummy! \u00a0I had their cornbeef with beans and potatoes on the side. \u00a0Their menu consists of large variety of howlie food. \u00a0My friends and family have had the following: \u00a0turkey leg, pastrami, spaghetti, clam chowder, maccarroni, and a turkey sloppy joe sandwich. \u00a0Their portions are large, affordable, and definitely yummy. \u00a0Other pluses: \u00a0free pickles ( I like pickles), the howlie setting, and the huge variety of beers.  Howlie-licious!",

I was worried about the parking situation, but it worked out great because we just parked in the AMC theater parking because we were going to see a movie afterwards anyway. Even so, there seemed to be open spots on the street as well.   I love the set up: get in line, order, pay, find a seat. It's that easy. I had the BBQ beef and it was good, but what put it over the top was the au jus/gravy it came with. It had a hint of that great BBQ flavor. My sister had the Turkey and it looked good too (they gave white as well as dark meat). The sourdough roll was great too.   The price isn't bad at all ($6.00 for a good sized sandwhich). Not a lot of menu items.  It was pretty cool to see them carve your meal right in front of you. The place wasn't too loud and they had televisions set up everywhere.",

I was always afraid to enter the City's Tenderloin district...but I would always see a huge line wrapping around inside this old school looking buffet styled establishment..so i had to check it out.   After my first Tommys experience, and I was hooked...what amazing displays of meat, and American homecooking. All their cooked meat is good, but my dish is the corned beef and cabbage.  Be ready to put on some weight and go to Tommys Joynt for good and hearty American cooking",

The BBQ brisket is tender and tasty, although the BBQ is a bit too sweet for my liking. The roast beef is rather tasty too, although it is less tender than the BBQ brisket and not as flavorful.  The baked beans as a side dish is pretty good, and I like the bread they serve with the meals.   Don't get the mac &amp; cheese here though; my friend and I both agreed that it tastes strangely sweet. which is not how mac &amp; cheese should taste like.  If you have a hankering of buffalo, the buffalo stew is scrumptious; skip the buffalo stew because you are unlikely to get a taste of the buffalo since the chili and beans will overwhelm whatever flavor of buffalo there is.  A great place to stop by for a bite to eat whenever you are in town and hankering for some simple comfort food to brighten your day.",

My boyfriend and I went to visit our awesome mutual friend in California where she lives now and we checked out a whole lot of places to eat and explore in California. The one that they both wanted to go back to was Tommy's Joynt. I wasn't that super impressed.  Maybe I just have a crappy food selection but I'd love it if EVERYTHING that this place had was good. When we first went I was kind of sick so I thought maybe my taste buds were off, I got a meatball sandwich. So the bread was great.  ::crickets::  However the meatballs sucked....meatballs.  Even my friend on our second visit there had meatballs with her spaghetti and she wasn't thrilled with them. However they have a huge \u00a0bar, everything on the menu and otherwise is cheap. They have daily specials but not always is there something too spectacular on the menu.  My friend and boyfriend loved the lasagna and my boyfriend the second time we went got this meatloaf thingy on a sandwich which was then like drowned with two kinds of sauces and mushrooms. I tried that and it was REALLY good. That was one of the specials, so was the lasagna. I had a German Sausage the second time we went and ....  Again with the crickets, it was just whatever. It was pretty tiny and the sauce they gave me with it was not the tastiest. I wouldn't personally go back unless I was thundering around the city and wanted a quick bite for cheap.   That's the other thing, its like cafeteria style aside from the bar, and then you seat yourself wherever. The vintagey stuff on the walls is pretty cool, its bar-ish. Pretty dim inside, a few booths, mostly tables and an upstairs. It's super cool though that you don't order drinks while you're getting your food. When you sit down a server takes your drink order, OR you can straight up go down to the bar.  Lines are long as hell though past dinner time for food and drinks.",

Flash-forward from the late 90's to 2006... Sitting on my computer yelping away trying to figure out what fine establishment I would be eating at that night... For some reason I was craving Cornbeef and cabbage and voila! The link for Tommy's Joynt caught my eye.  Dinner was awesome. I thought I was only going to order the corn beef and cabbage but as soon as I saw the foodgasmic array of meats, it was OOOOVER!!!! I ended up ordering the Brisket with a side of mashed potatoes with gravy and the Roast beef ... with a nice cold tall glass of Heff!!! MMmmmMmmm! (eyes closed day dreaming of Heffeweizen)  The food here is great, but in addition to enjoying a wonderful meal here, Tommy's offers a whole package with an energetic environment of people from all over SF, a homey feeling with the mess-hall style arrangement of tables where you can sit by a complete stranger and ooogle at every bit he takes of his food while you wait to eat yours... lol...

Like my friend put it, this place doesn't try too hard to be \"hip\" or \"cool\", it just is simply by having its own character and personality.  The same cashier and waitress have been there for years (according to a friend who went to UC Hastings), and the service and charm is all there. I am a gigantic pickle fan (not enough to suck down pickle juice.. I know you guys are out there), so I love that they have a huge barrell full of them that you can just grab yourself.  Onto the food... you order from a deli-style counter. I heard the breads they use in their sandwiches are too tough, so I opted for a dinner plate on the recommendation by a friend. They slice it right off of the slab of meat (I got the roast beef and also tried some of the bbq brisket), and pile it high next to a generous scoop of mashed potatoes, a dinner roll, and a choice of cucumber, potato, house salad or coleslaw. For 8 bucks! You also don't have to tip because you pay at the register and sit down with it.  They also have 3 dollar pints and $2 halfpints, so good deals all around. After I ate, I saw a guy walk away from the deli counter with a gargantuan steaming turkey leg with cascading cream of mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes which caused my stomach to grumble despite the generously portioned food I just consumed. I found out it costs 5.45, and that made me want to come back and try that even more!  A healthy late-night alternative to something like Carls Jr. I approve wholeheartedly. 5 stars!",

I stumbled across this restaurant with the help of fellow Yelpers who've been here and gave this place a thumbs up for their excellent food and laid back atmosphere. Alas, when I arrived, this place was PACKED. You stand in line - high school cafeteria style - to get your choice of meats, breads and drinks. I got the spaghetti and meatball while my friend got the roast beef dinner.   Damn it, it was so good.  Even though spaghetti and meatballs are probably the most lamest thing to order at a diner famous for their roast meats and potatoes, they did a damn good job with the spaghetti. The sauce was made from beef, and the meatballs were generously seasoned with herbs like garlic, paprika, oregano and Parmesan cheese. I also tasted the roast beef with the gravy and the signature potatoes and instantly fell into an oblivion of my younger years as a child eating deliriously happy at a local diner. Those were the days. And if any food can bring back such pleasant memories, I am so there.   The restaurant is much like a bar, seating is very limited and they offer a little service if you want drinks and such. It's a very roudy place so I don't recommend young children. The food is spectacular, but not over the top. Prices are at a fixed rate and if I remember correctly, under $10 for each dish. I hear people love the buffalo chili but I did \u00a0not try it however, I am regretting it at the moment because I am an avid chili love that would go to great lengths to eat good ones.

They have all different kinds of sandwiches, salads, desserts, chilli, beans, potatoes, green beans. \u00a0I ended up getting the pastrami sandwich and my boy friend got the roast beef sandwich and also some cole slaw. \u00a0The prices here are super reasonable as my sandwich was 6 bucks and i \u00a0only ate half and am saving the other half for breakfast tomorrow morning. \u00a0The pastrami sandwich was absolutely delicious. \u00a0The meat was warm and juicy and seasoned just right and the bread was thich and soft and chewy. \u00a0The cole slaw was really yummy.  The service here is also excellent. \u00a0The guy carving the meat was really nice and when we sat down, the lady working here asked how i was doing. \u00a0I thought that was really great.  I can't believe I waited so long to try this place out! \u00a0Now that I've been here, I know for sure I will definatley be coming back! \u00a0Tommy's Joynt is absoultely sublime and it doesn't hurt that they stay open late!!",

When I came in, it had the feel of a hofbrau and an old fashioned dive bar meshed into one. Personally, I really liked the energy and atmosphere of this place. A lot of smiles, good vibes and hipsters. The huge bar doesn't hurt either  Let me get on with the food. I got a BBQ beef sandwich with cole slaw on the side. The sandwich was juicy and tender. Their sourdough bread was perfect too. The cole slaw was great too. Not too saucy which is important to me. You order and soon as you walk in and watch them put your food together as you pay with the cashier. All the workers were friendly and helpful.   I ordered a Hefe to drink but it tasted a little strange. Some weird after-taste that just wasn't right. That was the only thing that kept this from being a five star review. But I'd say Tommy's Joynt is definitely worth the try. I enjoyed the experience.",

    "review_text": "Their web site states that this place was established in 1947. I would have thought earlier; it just seems to me the place has been there forever. It is a bit of a San Francisco Landmark.  With some notable exceptions, the food is good, but not great. The corned beef is hard to beat, but then, it is pretty hard to screw-up corned beef.  But I am going to give the place TWO STARS (2 1/2, really), because it is so damned dirty in there. I was in there last night, for the first time in quite a while. The carpets are filthy!! \u00a0That simply is not right. Geez!  UPDATE No. 1:  Sam K. of Tommy's has explained that the floors were just re-done in wood, and asked that I come back for a look. I certainly will, and will post my \"re-thunk\" review here.  UPDATE No. 2 (12/30/09):  Wow! I am impressed. Sam K., the owner, has been very persistent and responsive to this review of mine. That says a lot; at least he cares, and is watching. So, okay, that gets 'em up to three and 1/2 stars.   Sam K. explained that there are new hardwood floors on the main level (and I went back to take a look - yup), and that they are about to re-do the mezzanine level too.   I did have a back-to-the-basics, no-frills corned beef sandwich in there the other night (on french roll) for $5.60. That is a deal!!!  I think Sam K. has a predicament. In a Landmark place like this, how the Heck do you maintain the \"old landmark ambiance,\" and at the same time keep it from going downhill? This is why I am NOT in the restaurant business. Too much work!",

I got my baked potato with sour cream, butter, and a bread roll, so it was a cheap meal. You really don't wait long since you stand in line and get your food at the counter. The waitress was nice and helped us move from a small booth to a larger table in the back, there is plenty of space. Everyone was pretty nice here.

I got the beef brisket and mashed potatoes, with a side salad ($10).

I'd give it another chance but I just wasn't impressed enough to go for round 2. My girlfriend got the BBQ beef sandwich and it was delicious so mayhaps coming back during lunch would be better.

This holdout from the 1940's, poorly lit and covered by posters and paraphanillia from every era of city life happens to be one of those places where ethereal past collides with a tenuous present, allowing for a rarefied coexistence which leaves one with a peculiar sense of what The City may have been like before gentrification and Hipster domination.   While my roast beef sandwich was certainly not of the highest quality, and exceptionally basic (bread and meat), seeing the meat for my sandwich expertly sliced from a giant slab of beef gave me a primordial thrill that I simply cannot find in restaurants with...you know...kitchens.  Booze is CHEAP! 8 ounces of wine for under 4$? I'm cool with that. A wide selection of beers? Yep. Overpoured shots? Definitely. Will they judge you for getting faded at lunchtime? Hell no!   All in all, having a sandwich, a bowl of buffalo chili and a pint of Anchor Steam at Tommy's is a classically San Francisco experience that should be shared by every resident of our city (vegans included!).",

Line up, peruse their extensive meat selection (they've salads, too), place an order, then find a seat. Need help? Service won't bite.  Last I was here, we shared a few sandwiches (inexpensive; cash only). The accompanying dipping sauce was delicious, and the horseradish on the table had a hell of a kick. The kielbasa was tender and tasty, the pastrami divine.  For drinks, their selection of beer is as hefty as their meats. There's domestic and worldwide brews (English, German, Belgian, etc.) on draft, plus bottles. My friend had a Chimay, while I had a Guinness.  My only regret? Not indulging in their barrel of free pickles.  Assuming you're not here after a night of marathon drinking, visit during off-peak hours to avoid a crowd.",

I saw the big cuts of meat out and absolutely had to try one of their famous big sandwiches. \u00a0I opted for the roast beef. \u00a0I saw them pull out a big roll and thought \"Wow, I'll never finish that!\". \u00a0Turns out it's just a big roll they cut into little pieces. \u00a0It was maybe 8in what I got. \u00a0Surely they'll pile on the meat though... nope, a standard amount of meat. \u00a0I liked the au jus that was served with the sandwich, but that was the only good part of it. \u00a0The meat was otherwise bland and flavorless. \u00a0I also heard good things about the buffalo chili, but what I got tasted like a standard canned beef chili.  My gf wanted to try the lamb shank special. \u00a0It was unevenly cooked so that some parts were really good with the gravy and all, but other parts were tough.  One of my friends got the pastrami sandwich, which she said was dry (even with the juice). \u00a0She didn't even finish it, a sure sign that it's not irresistable. \u00a0We also had a vegetarian in our group, and all they had for him was a swiss cheese sandwich. \u00a0Really? \u00a0How many years has it been open, and they never figured out some vegetarian options?!  There are also a few people saying this place is cheap. \u00a0Compared to a steakhouse, yes. $6 for the sandwich + $3 for the cup of chili does not equal cheap to me. \u00a0I had better eats in SF for a lot cheaper, and those included leftovers. \u00a0This place left me hungry, but not for their food.  Maybe you'll like it if you were raised on it, and maybe some out-of-towners might enjoy. \u00a0This Angelino will take the sandwiches of Phillipe's and Cole's PE Buffet any day, and actually leave satisfied.",

The bread didn't seem too fresh. The best part was the BBQ sauce which seemed homemade.  The place had a weird vibe. Divey but not that welcoming for some reason (it's really dark and kinda depressing).  Overall it was a bit better than ok.",

It is old school U.S. cafeteria style haufbrau. When I was a young punk alcoholic I loved the food and the prices. In 1993 I brought my visiting German friends from the psychobilly band Mad SIn to eat here. They hated it! If drunk Germans do not like your German food then you know your in trouble. Basically, this is 1950s American food disguised as Haufbrau. Its only good for broke punks, cheap rich people, and grandparents. If you want quality \u00a0Haufbrau go to Suppenk\u00fcche in Hayes Valley--lots of horrible yuppies but good authentic German food.",

Silver Lining: The bar does have an excellent beer selection if you are craving a harder to find foreign brew.  Tommy's probably deserves more like two stars, but the charm of the place earned it its third. \u00a0And hey, what are your other options in this hood, Mel's?",

I know a lot of people grew up eating here. Let's put that aside and concentrate on the food.   The food itself is your cafeteria style format............sorta like chick and coop on Taraval. I personally don't like that place neither. Maybe I am just not a Hauf brau kinda guy. I also should have known when my friend picked this restaurant. If you are ever looking for all of the best 2 star restaurants in the city, let me know and I'll introduce you to him.   I ordered the meatball sandwich. The meatballs were luke warm to borderline cold. The meat sauce helped bring the temperature up a level but it was still, at best, warm. The establishment itself is in a bar, a dive bar. The price is reasonable and the seating area is scattered but this place can hold a lot of people. My other friend who ordered the spaghetti and meatballs agreed with me. I would not bring out of towners here, unless you don't like them or you don't want them to come back and visit you. This is probably a place I would eat if I had no other choice and if I was stuck on the corner of Van Ness and Geary. I would even choice Mel's across the street. Gosh.........I hate that place too. hahahhhaa.   Patrons who eat here are your typical middle class to blue collar workers and mostly tourists. A lot of my friends actually come here late at night after a night of boozing. Probably one of the reasons why they like this place that much.",

Unfortunately I didn't find too much diversity in the menu. \u00a0Again, meat and carbs and I didn't find either in proportion enough to justify the price. \u00a0I know the sandwiches come in under $6 but given that they are literally just meat and bread (old world sandwich?), I found it a bit lacking. \u00a0I thought charging $2.50 for the salad was a bit laughable.

It was so simple, in fact, that after watching him make it, I doubted how good it was going to be. \u00a0Silly me. The meat was so tender and the au jus so savory; the bread was the perfect balance of crunchy and soft that it didn't upstage the meat - it managed to work with it. \u00a0The whole sandwich was really a perfect combination of flavors and textures. \u00a0I devoured it. \u00a0(It helped that I spent a whole morning working up an appetite walking around the city. This lunch was like my sweet reward.)  On thing to note that was good, but less than perfect: the brussels sprouts. They were fine.

This is hands-down the best place to go after a long week at work. Cheap but good strong drinks, and cheap but amazing filling food. Anything from a gin&amp;tonic with steamed salmon, to a Russian stout with a roasted leg of lamb. Or maybe you want a massive corned beef sandwich on sourdough with a house margarita? Whatever floats your boat - you've got it! I will not hesitate to say that this is hands-down the cheapest and best place to get food and drink in the city. Don't forget though, it's cash only, luckily an ATM awaits you inside.",

I'm adding a star for this moist and delicious sandwich!  Make sure you have them dip your sourdough bread, and grab yourself some free sliced pickles on the side. They make all the difference : )",

The first time I had the turkey enchilada, sooo good! \u00a0The sauce was delicious and very unique...it was not too thin, but also not thick. \u00a0Perfect consistency pretty much and it was super tasty. \u00a0The second time I went I got the knockwurst sandwich, and it too was good. \u00a0However, it was too much bread for not that much meat (since the knockwurst is not too wide). \u00a0The food is authentic and you can see everything before you order something so it kind of makes ordering easier.  I love the fact that they have free pickles that are self serve because I love pickles! \u00a0The only down side to this place is that parking can be hard to find and they are cash only. \u00a0If someone didn't know that and they didn't have any cash then it probably would be a pain. \u00a0Other than those two things, it is such a great find.",

Okay, sure it isn't as nice when they don't have room at the bar or in one of those 4 very cool booths. \u00a0And yes it smells funny. \u00a0And it doesn't appear that clean and yes it totally sucks to have to walk up those steep narrow steps after 5 shots of tequilla to use the bathroom...but its been there for YEARS! \u00a0And the people are nice. \u00a0The bartenders are totally old school (Jose's family makes tequilla somewhere in Mexico, he'll show you pics of agave plants if you ask!). \u00a0And where else can you go and find a busser with Mario's mustache? \u00a0Because he works there! \u00a0AND I'm pretty sure John Voigt is a regular (he drinks the cheap cheap wine that they serve in margarita type glasses)..okay its not really him, but it sure looks like him and he really is there every single time that I am. \u00a0  What I'm trying to say is Tommy's is good, its classic, its cheap, they serve food till 1:30 am or something like that, they have good strong drinks and every lover of food in San Francisco should try it...at least once, but leave your vegetarian friend at home!",

So wonderful the mashers were tasty and the turkey was juicy. They are not shy either they pile it on your plate. My husband got the rib special, they were huge and he ate every bit of food on his plate and so did I. We can't forget to talk about the awesome variety of drinks from all around the world.. There are so many we didn't know what to order, I ended up with a Shiner Bock and he got a Red Stripe, they have choices from everywhere and we had these drinks.. Too funny. We also, ordered bloody mary's you have a choice of whatever Vodka you want in it and if you want it spicy or real spicy. So good! The place is decorated with every old beer tin ever made, old pictures and vintage everything including the lighting. The only thing that sucked was we had to keep running out to the street to put more change in the meter. I guess they have underground parking but we couldn't find it.. However, no worries the waitresses are super friendly and were happy to change our dollar bills, remember that if you run out of change. We for sure will be back again.

I ordered a turkey sandwich on light rye &amp; a side of mashed potatoes...oh my God, so bomb and wayy too filling! I ate half of my potatoes and sandwich before throwing in the towel with a slight food coma. \u00a0The turkey was very moist and cooked better than my dads (sorry dad, love you!) &amp; the mashed potatoes and gravy were bomb. \u00a0I love that this place serves real food! \u00a0Not the frozen boxed crap. \u00a0 My friend order the clam chowder and pastrami sandwich. \u00a0She said it was the best clam chowder she's ever had (I'll take her word for it since I don't eat chowder) and that the pastrami sandwich and beans were bomb. Oh we also split a giant chocolate chip cookie, mmm \u00a0my sweet tooth loved it!  After sitting there trying to recover my friends wanted to go get a beer from the bar. \u00a0They have a wide variety of drinks and the bartender was very friendly and she was a cutie. \u00a0 I definitely will be coming back :)",

If you need some meat with a cheap beer at midnight, and you could care less about what the walls and tablecloth look like, this is the place for you. Yes, it's cash only, but there's an ATM inside with a $2 surcharge.  This was my first visit in several years. It was late, it'd been a really long day, and we needed some hearty grub. Since we were there after midnight, in the middle of the week, there was plenty of parking. It was definitely a local crowd. We had the turkey dinner. You get two sides with it; we didn't find anything else we liked, but the guy at the counter gently insisted we get something. The husband eventually had an extra side of potatoes, and I went with the cole slaw. We were pleasantly surprised with the turkey. It looked dry as it got carved, but it was actually pretty moist. Everything else was tasty, too. Our dinners and two sodas came to under $25. While I didn't have any booze, their bar is pretty epic... and cheap.  I really need to come here more often.",

Now maybe I'm just finicky, but I can't stand a messy sandwich that a) you can't eat with your hands b) falls apart if you try to pick it up. So this was basically my worst nightmare - one that required a fork and knife.  The food wasn't bad as such, and you can't \u00a0beat the prices.

The food area reminded me of a Chinese walkway with red-lights hovering above old meat that has clearly been crusted over and sitting there for a few days. \u00a0It was 6pm - you would think the food would be piping hot right? \u00a0Wrong. After my buddy ordered 4 plates of food I figured we'd have enough of a good taste test to see how this meal would pan out. \u00a0I inquired about the German sausage and was shown a silver tin of about 5 sausages floating to the top of some sort of thick liquid.... I chose to pass. \u00a0I'm not a fan of Thanksgiving day meals and this place seems to sell them all. \u00a0The open-faced meatball sandwich sounded like a safe choice or so I thought. \u00a0We sat down with 5 plates at our table. \u00a0My meatball sandwich which consisted of 4 oddly-shaped pieces of bread and sauce smothering TWO quarter sized meatballs. \u00a0you read that right, TWO. \u00a0I guess they were trying to save a buck by charging me $6 for this \"meal\" and skipping the meat. \u00a0I said \"what the hell\" and took a bite. \u00a0FIRST bite was a nice solid chunk of gristle which made for an unpleasant experience. \u00a0Needless to say I charged on and finished my meatballs - both of them. \u00a0That's it. \u00a0I had one small bite of bread and was dissatisfied as it appeared soggy and looked like it was left over from a day or two before. \u00a0My friend chose the pasta which tasted slimy and cold. \u00a0He ordered the turkey with stuffing, gravy and mashed potatoes. \u00a0The turkey was cold and gravy lukewarm. \u00a0Stuffing was horrible as he took one bite and spit it out. \u00a0The saving grace was the store-bought mashed potatoes that you obviously knew came from a box. \u00a0His side salad didn't look appealing at all, as if it came from the Round Table salad bar complete with \"wooden\" woven bowl. \u00a0The bread roll was probably the only thing on the menu that was edible as everything else was cold and sickeningly inedible.   I would never in a million years recommend Tommy's Joynt or say that it is anything close to a San Francisco Landmark. \u00a0Unless we're associating SF with horrible food.

After eating small eats at another place, my group was serious about eating up and getting full so I took them to Tommy's. \u00a0I don't know if it's part ye old curiousity or just has character, either way while you're waiting in the line there's so much on the walls and ceiling to look at you will not get bored as you walk through the assembly line.   They ordered a french dip sammy to split, I stuck with clam chowder (still full from the last place) and called it good. We paid and looked for a place to sit down. At 9pm it was pretty packed so we walked around to find a seat and found a dripping ceiling which made me think of a sinking wooden ship. Nothing too bad but thankfully we found a seat away from the dripping pipe, and munched on the food. The chowder was just right with the help of a trusty friend called Tapatio. The crowd is pretty mixed, like a typical game night hangout with a bunch of regulars. \u00a0  This is no sinking ship and if I'm ever in need of good ol' fashioned comfort food this is the place to find me.",

Her tits are sagging and the voice is kind of blown out but you sit there and politely laugh and cheer but in your heart you're thinking, \"Man, this shit is kind of sad.\"\n  Despite the new paint job on the outside (there's a hand waving hello and below it it says \"Hello Stranger!\" God, I love that) the inside is somewhat dark and seems to be unchanged in the last 50 years. The menu reflects that as well but then again have you ever gone to a hof brau and been impressed by their innovative and playful menu? Thought not. They've got all the standbys, roast beef, corned beef, BBQ brisket (although I think they use corn starch or something to thicken their BBQ sauce. Say WHAT?!) and their \"World Famous turkey breast.\" I doubt if people in COLMA are talking about this turkey breast but who am I to talk, I claim to have \"World Famous dance moves.\" What, you haven't heard of that either?\n  There's a full bar with an impressive selection of beer and for some reason you have to order and pay for all beverages separately.\n  Don't get me wrong, I like Tommy's Joynt but it's kind of like a dive bar in the sense that you can find comfort in being a total slob and knowing no one is going to judge you.

We ordered: - Corned beef sandwich on a dinner roll [not good] - BBQ Brisket over rice [okay] - 2 baked beans [good] - 1 mac and cheese [okay]  Some noteworthy items to mention:  I was not impressed with my corned beef sandwich. It was just two-three slices of corned beef in a dinner roll with nothing else to jazz it up. Even the side of au jus did not help the sandwich... I've had great french dip sandwiches that were amazing alone and even more spectacular with au jus before and that was at Sonoma Chicken Coop. Though this is a completely different sandwich, its flavors consisted of nothing distinct enough to make my taste buds even twitch.

I tried it today and was relieved to discover that it was as good as it looked on TV.   Tommy's Joynt is a Van Ness/San Francisco landmark that you don't want to miss. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted by the sights and smells of meat and alcohol characteristic of a dive eatery/hofbrau. The cafeteria style line you stand in moves by extremely quickly, and the menu is huge. They've got lamb shank, pastas, salads, sandwiches, corned beef, ox-tail, fruits, vegetables... i couldn't name everything if I tried.   I ordered a meatball sandwich which was definitely a knife-and-forker. Their meat sauce was really well cooked: not too salty or sweet. I also tried a bite of their corned beef and lamb shank which were also really good. The only thing that was iffy was their au-jus that comes with other meat sandwiches. I tried some and it tasted a little like cinnamon or molasses. Not sure what that was about.  ***REMEMBER!*** This place only takes cash. Just a heads up for if you ever stroll in with an empty stomach and empty wallet.

We ordered 2 brisket plates with beans, coleslaw, potato salad, &amp; stuffing. The food is dished out cafeteria style. Some people might call it prison style, but whatever. You pay &amp; then choose from limited tables or booths. Keep walking though, there's a short staircase that leads to more tables. Then, at some point, most likely when your at least 1/2 way through your meal, a waitress comes over for your drink order. Then you have to pay for your drinks. I'm not a big fan of the \"2 pay process\" but I'm easy-breezy, I can deal. The food is like a good homemade meal my Midwestern grandparents would have cooked up. It was meaty, starchy and very hearty. The beef was good. The beans could have been cooked longer, they were hard but had a good flavor. The stuffing was too soft &amp; mushy, not the right texture. The bottom was burnt. The coleslaw was good but the star of the meal was the potato salad, it was awesome. All in all, it was good. Nothing wowed me. I couldn't tell if the decor was meant to look old &amp; really dirty or if it actually was old &amp; really dirty. It's an interesting place to say the least. \u00a0Someone tried to break into our rental car parked across the street while we were eating. The windows had some damage. Good thing we got the extra insurance! When we return to SF, we'll probably skip this place. But I am glad we tried it.",

I blindly followed, and against all odds, the place we went to was AMAZING. We walked in and the first thing we see is a giant cafeteria-style counter with tons and tons of MEAT behind it. Then the prices are right behind that - and they were so... reasonable. The bar was on the other side of the restaurant. It's a very fun and casual atmosphere - tons of delicious food, and seemingly fun people.  We had the corned beef dinner plate, with mashed potatoes and beans. \u00a0The beans! OMG amazing. \u00a0Loved everything I got.  I was super impressed with this place - turns out it's highly rated on yelp after all. Awesome. Open late too, and busy at night as well, even at 10:30pm on a weeknight. Since then, we've been back multiple times, and everything that we've tried has been great. \u00a0Always get the beans though, they are amazing.",

I'd give you a zero if I could. \u00a0We had a huge group of about 10 people coming from a leukemia charity event hoping to end the night in a good way at your restaurant. \u00a0My friend purchased a vegetarian meal from Mel's Diner across the street and joined us for the late night dinner in your restaurant. \u00a0After the rest of our party (9 people out of 10) had ordered our food from your restaurant, your waitress came up the stairs to tell my friend that he couldn't bring in outside food. Wtf?! She even stayed around to make sure he put his veggie burger &amp; fries away. \u00a0Wtf?! Your discrimination against my vegetarian friend was uncalled for. \u00a0We tried to explain to her that he was \u00a0vegetarian and that Tommy's didn't really have any vegetarian meal options on their menu for him. \u00a0Side salad, coleslaw, or beans?! OoooOoo... What a variety of choices for a filling meal. Not!  I told her this was discriminating. \u00a0She replied saying bringing in outside food would cause other restaurant goers to be curious of what food my vegetarian friend was eating. \u00a0Yea... your specialized meat restaurant was surely threatened by his veggie burger. \u00a0I think everyone there that night decided to become a vegetarian b/c his burger looked oh so much more delicious than your food. \u00a0Give me a break.  So my friend had to put his food away and told us to eat our food because he didn't want us to mind him. \u00a0I felt so terrible! \u00a0There we all were with our food and ALL of us lost our appetite. \u00a0Who would want to eat after that, esp when he had to watch us eat? \u00a0Total downer for the night!  Btw, she came back up after 15 minutes and changed her mind saying she didn't want to get in trouble and told my friend he could eat his food. \u00a0(Duuur, \u00a0you knew it was not the right thing to do). \u00a0The mood and our appetite were already lost. \u00a0I wouldn't blame him for not wanting to eat anymore either after being pointed out in front of everyone (not just my friends, but everyone on the 2nd floor) to put his food away.  What we really should've done was give the food back and ask for a refund so we could spend it elsewhere. \u00a0I'd rather choose a vegetarian friendly restaurant to spend my money at than yours!",

It's like stepping through the door into an old saloon out of a Poe novel, with a splash of camp thrown in to lighten the mood.  But enough about how much of a dive this place is. The food is awesome. Not *all* the food, mind you. It's a hofbrau, some of the food is going to be downright mediocre, some of it is going to be greasy, some of it is going to be disappointing. But you can *see* what you're ordering before you order it. I rarely look at the menu, I'm usually too busy looking at the food. I've experimented some, and been disappointed plenty of times, sure. But that just makes me come back again to find something else! The one thing that I get every time, without fail? Buffalo chili. Oh god, I'm craving it just thinking about it. Can't recommend it highly enough. The portions have shrunk in the past ten years, but it's still damn tasty, and makes up for any other poor choices I've made at the same time.

Vegetarians beware! It seems like a no-brainer bang for your buck. Wait in line, a la cafeteria style, and tell the guys behind the counter exactly what you want. Cash only, folks.  Upon closer inspection, the meat isn't that good. Shocker. About an hour after our meal ended, my stomach started to lurch. Add a jostling BART ride into the equation and you've got a nauseous customer.   Come here and get a Reuben sandwich and a beer, that seems like a much safer choice than the dinner plate. If you want a lot of decent-quality meat, go to House of Prime Rib just down the way.",

I have heard mix reviews on this place so I was a little hesitant since I already have a hot baruf place I love. Anyhow, I gave it a shot.  We ordered a corned beef sandwich, a pastrami sandwich, and a side of stuffing.  The ambiance was cool. The people were nice and my overall experience was good. The reason I am giving it a 3 stars is because the corned beef had some dry areas on the side so I didn't devour it in 60 seconds like I usually do with corned beef sandos. We saw someone order a pastrami and that looked really juicy so we also ordered that. It was actually better than the corned beef. My only problem with this was there was a chewy fat area and they didn't cut it off. It was annoying picking that out of my sandwich. The stuffing was soggy and mushy. I like it when there are some dry pieces of bread and you can see some vegis in it. This was just mush. The gravy poured on top was a bit clumpy too.  I am a huge sandwich whore. Don't think dirty please..... I love my sandwiches. The best corned beef in SF is Lefty O'douls (french roll and have them dip both sides of the bread in the au jus), best pastrami is Miller's East coast deli. I also like Lee's deli in the financial district too if I want a quick good sandwich fix.  I am happy I tried Tommy's but I need to be loyal to my sandwiches and deal with the crappy parking and sometimes paying for the union square parking lot and have my corned beef sandos at Lefty O'douls.",

Starved and shackled in someone's basement and forced to eat nothing but bread and water?   Tommy's Joynt isn't bad per say. They have been open forever and apparently my dad had his first job here has a bus boy. You can still get a reasonably priced meal here and a drink until 2 AM.   Tommy's really caters to everybody (except vegetarians or snobby foodies). They offer cafeteria style comfort food in hearty portions and offer a full bar.   My meals here have always been just so-so. The last time I was here my turkey was pretty bland and cold. The potatoes were meh and the gravy was gross. I wouldn't touch the stuffing. \u00a0I would stick to sandwiches here. They offer a pretty decent selection of sides/salads. The coffee was good, but they only offer one free refill. They want to nickel and dime you here, so stick to ordering the basics as another poster suggested--the pickle barrel and serve it yourself water might just suffice.   I wasn't wowed by the food, but I like the atmosphere. It seemed a little raucous and busy for a weekday night. I had a lot of fun listening to this old man who looked exactly like Vincent Price tell me tall tales.   All the tables are family style here, so pull up a chair and make a new friend. It's more fun than you think. Maybe being the only woman here helped.   It's cash only for food and the bar.",

That's right - we actually made plans for our late night meal and arrived safely before close at 1am (they had told us over the phone they were closing at 1:20am that night, ha!)  Insanely awesome portions of warm, delicious, neutral-colored food. I recommend the coleslaw as (at least one) of your sides. Good beer selection too and a nice place to meet real SFers, undoubtedly hanging at the bar drinking beer and eating solo. Fantastic, eclectic \u00a0decor.

This place is popular, with a line out the door during dinnertime that snakes back and forth in the restaurant before you make it to the front of the counter to order. After choosing your entrees and sides, they throw your meal together, and then you pay at the end of the counter. Help yourself to water and pickles out of a barrel, and then carry your tray to the table, where a waitress will take your drink order.  Tommy's Joynt differs from the establishments you would see in the South in being more expensive, having smaller portions, and being frankly a little less tasty. A meal here comes out to 10 or 11 dollars, which I suppose is cheap by SF standards for a restaurant meal. The portion size was satisfying for this reviewer, but not gigantic, like you would see in the South. And while the dishes I sampled were decent, there are better BBQ restaurants even in SF, albeit much more expensive. I wish they had more varieties of pickles in the pickle barrel (the pickles weren't anything special), and I wish they had more kinds of barbecue sauce available to sample and mix.",

I like my meat drenched in sauce so for all those who like it the same way, ask for extra. The lasagna is far from dry. It's extra creamy and perfect to dip my sandwich in.   The atmosphere is warm with rustic decorations and stained glass trimming. I didn't get a chance to check out the upstairs, but the place was pretty roomy on a weeknight.   The staff is all-around nice and efficient. The line went by faster than expected. It's also a nice touch that they have someone to help people move along in line, but I guess you have to have some kind of doorman when you have so many customers.

You wait in line and tell the guys behind the counter which meat you'd like carved on your plate.

You can then select a side dish to pair with it (mashed potatoes with gravy, mac &amp; cheese, and other sides that your cardiologist would probably not recommend. They then ring your tray up at the old-school register (Cash Only, btw), hand you a roll and some butter, and then you're off to find a table.  Most everything here is priced under $10.

For $5 I couldn't even finish the food on my plate!",

Now let me start from what happen that night. I was meeting two of my homies here for some late night dinner after the gym my two homies were already standing in line in front and ready to order and here I come walking in and I ask hey guys what are you getting for dinner tonight? Then two white guys standing behind my homies thought I was trying to cut in line so I said \u00a0sorry I was only \u00a0asking them what they were getting for dinner then I walk to the back if the line. While I was standing in line I see that the two white guys was standing in front of the cashier to pay for there food and whisper something to the cashier and then he look over at me with a weird look then he whisper something over to the server then he give me a weird look and finally when I reach the front of the line to order my food the server totally ignore me for exactly two minutes and I said can I please get the brisket dinner with double mash five times before he decided to serve me and when he bought my plate up to place in my tray I can see his fingers all over my mash and brisket. I kept my cool and walk over to pay for my dinner then the cashier did the same thing to mean and ignore for exactly 4 minute until someone else behind me said something then he decided to finally talk to me and rude and loudly said 9.50 so I handed over my 20 dollar bill and when I reach over to get my change he just drop it on my tray close to my food. I couldn't believe that really happen to me after again coming here for over 20 plus years just cuz some white guys said something to them and they could treat me like that is just fuck up!!! I am asian and I realize today that we are still living in an environment that the race cards comes in to play is ridiculous and I am outrage and I will never come eat here ever again!!!!!",

The BBQ briscuit beef and corned beef ha e to be my favorite, accompanied by mashed potatoes and baked beans... Ummm it's making me hungry right now. All of the people that work there are so nice and I think they are often suprised at the amount I consume n such a short period of time. They also have a full bar which I usually try to stay awayfrom cuz I coMe in after enjoying my neighborhood night life.  It is honestly my favorite place in the city, better than any bar and an yvenue I just seriously love it.

The food is high quality and there were tons of locals sneaking in for carry out late in the evening which is a great sign of course.   It's in a great location with lots of cool bars all around it like Vertigo, etc. The Opal across the street is a great place to stay for the night for like $50 if you book ahead.

Their loss, they were closed and wouldn't let us in even to order to-go.   The homeless man out front suggested we try out Tommy's. I should have gone back and given him some change and a high five for the suggestion.   Tommy's is the most awesome dive spot full of character, gross yet lovely charm, and HOT FOOD AT 2AM. What more do you want? Their selection of drinks is absurd. The decor is hilariously entertaining. There is even a signed \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" poster. WINNING.   It's a gem. I'd go back.

I always go for the mashed potatoes, they are so creamy and buttery. I honestly don't know where else to go for quality, homestyle mashed potatoes in this city. The buffalo chili is really good too, and even the white rice was buttery and delicious.  I have been to Tommy's for dinner a number of times now, and each time I left feeling happy and full!

The meat is totally melt in your mouth tender and the fat blobs are the perfect consistency. I only wish their \"barbecue\" sauce wasn't essentially horrible. I mean, just don't plan on judging it on the bbq sauce. Get it dry and put A1 on it or bring your own sauce. Oh, Dave S is right; this place is purgatory or worse for vegetarians.  Tonight I met some old friends there to break some bad news to them. It was the perfect place to do it. Our seasonal crab feed has been cancelled. Pretty devastating but Tommy's made up for it by coincidentally having a raffle drawing - all you needed to do to get a ticket was buy a drink. The red checked tablecloths and the raffle drawing were exactly like the annual crab feed, and we all felt a little bit better for some old San Francisco institutions still being around.  People should understand that Tommy's is a cafeteria style place and also that it is funky with lots of nooks and crannies and old stuff. The service is very nice, but you're not going to get pampered and the food is what it is. The meat is generally good quality, the soups and chilis are loved by all, but gourmet it ain't. If you haven't been to Tommy's and you like places like Lefty's and/or a cheap meal among people who feel like friends, you'll feel warm and cozy at Tommy's. The other thing I can vouch for is the turkey leg with stuffing. Can't go wrong.",

I mean come on now, if you been in business this many damn years then why not step into the year 2009 and get a damn debit card machine, hell I've seen vendors at street fairs and flea markets with debit card machines so what's Tommy's excuse?  So after we dig in our wallets to come up with some cash I ordered the bbq brisket sandwich on sourdough. So I see them cut up the brisket and give me a few slices and I'm thinking \"thats all?\" I know its $5.50 and all but damn I guess times must be tough. I mean the bread made up the majority of the sandwich, isn't it suppose to be the other way around? And to top it off I have to bust out my wallet again to buy my drink since you can't buy it when you pay for your food.

Cash only, so make sure you hit up your bank's ATM prior.  I ordered the beef brisket special which came with mashed potatoes (my choice as opposed vegetables) and beans (as opposed to a salad). The beef brisket was probably some of the best brisket I have ever had in my life. Slathered in their homemade BBQ sauce, I seriously did not want this meal to end! Every slice of my brisket was juicy, plentiful and tasty. There was no bad part to meal, and I was honestly looking for something to be a stickler about, The portions were adamant for the price and everything was just amazing.  I can't wait to come back here and trying the giant turkey leg!",

I am giving them an extra star solely for the bar section even though I did not drink there. If I ever come back, it will be to get a cheap drink at the bar, not to eat.",

At first, I was a bit skeptical about getting sandwiches for dinner, but I really liked the BBQ Beef. Even though it only had mustard, mayo, (and cheese I think?), it still had a great smoky taste, and was pretty tender as well - it just tasted...real (if that makes sense). The only thing that kept it from being the perfect BBQ beef sandwich is that the bread was a bit tough to my liking.  Love the backyard BBQ atmosphere of the place, and it remained crowded throughout the night.",

The cuts are usually pretty fatty but that's how they're priced. 2) Stay away from the pasta. \u00a0I love pasta but had a stomach ache twice after eating the pasta meat sauce. \u00a0 3) My favorite thing is the turkey leg and rice.  This place is relatively cheap - expect a cut of meat with side and salad to go for 8-9 bucks, but you get what you pay for (I can get $4 sushi at Safeway too.. doesn't mean I should).

I wandered over, bored and wanting for something to do while waiting for my friend to get off work. I was immediately shocked at the line drifting out of the doorway. Luckily enough, it moves very quickly.  I'm a beef lover, so my eyes immediately drifted to the BBQ brisket and corned beef. Indecisive, I asked for half and half and they were happy to oblige. I got mashed potatoes and salad for my sides. Everything was so yummy, but the meat was divine. It was really juicy, succulent and oh-so-melt-in-your-mouth good. I loved it so much, I went back the next night.  The beer selection is enormous... It's mostly bottled but they have a great selection of imports, Belgians, and many other beers.  The setting is very quaint, with communal tables and a wonderful bar that patrons can opt to dine at. That's where I had my dinner and the bartender was happy to provide me with not only drinks, but also silverware and anything else that I needed.  But what puts Tommy's over the top is the prices. Uncharacteristically low for San Fran, Tommy's keeps tried and true to low prices and hefty, yet quality-induced portions. Looking forward to my next visit to Tommy's!",

Washed down with a coffee and tea the total came to $18.99 which fitted nicely into our 20 buck limit for sunday dinner.  The food was great - we'd not had home style before and we will be back ASAP to fill up again. The seating is in long tables and makes dinner a more social experience .  Parking at the hotel next to Tommy's was easy - take the ticket to the cashier when you leave after your chow and pay then and there. $1.50 for an hour was pretty reasonable given the hassle it is parking in this area.  The only reason this place dropped a star was because it was so darn busy.

Came here with the bf last night after catching a Giants game... we were starving but refused to pay big bucks for a dinky ballpark frank and beer. We decided to hoof it down to the TL and met up with one of our pals for some meat sammies instead.  Here are some things to love about Tommy's Joynt, in no particular order:  - DELICIOUS SANDWICHES, FULL OF MEAT! - jar of sliced pickles, yours for the taking - the old timey-dive bar-irish pub-truck stop-new york deli-bbq pit vibe - various gravys (gravies? dipping sauces.) - will not break the bank; big portions for small bucks - extra extra hot horseradish - the hilarious spelling of Joynt  I had the pastrami and bf had the corned beef. WOOOOW you guys. I'm from New York: I know what good deli meat tastes like... and I was blown away. SO DANG GOOD! Both were truly remarkable, although I have to say, the gravy that came with the corned beef was a little better, kind of sweet and very complimentary to the meat. Well played, Tommy's Joynt. Well played.  After we settled into a booth, our very friendly and patient waitress came over to get our drinks. I asked her what was on draught and had to stop her after 30 seconds... the list is pretty much endless! Our other friend was too poor to order anything (times is tough, y'all!) but she brought him a half pint \"sympathy beer\" anyway. So sweet!  Seems like they do cater to a pretty late crowd, which was nice- we didn't feel like we were being hurried at any point. The place was still pretty packed when we left, around midnight.  So. If you ever find yourself in the TL with an empty tummy, the wind is howling and the air is damp, do yourself a favor and grab a seat at Tommy's Joynt... you can thank me later with a pastrami on sourdough.

The place was great, feel good food. Real simple, real quick. We did not order anything to drink. The place is cafeteria style, nothing fancy, and it was cash only, but while you wait in line there is an atm right on the way through the line (conveniently I might add.)  With some daily specials, cheap beer, and late hours, we will definitely be back!",

They've got an impressive selection of bottled beer from around the world. Overall a great place to bring people from out of town. On with the food!  Round of Beef Sandwich - surprisingly tasty although the bread is only so-so. Comes with au jus and the table has hot/mild mustard and horseradish. Although a little dry, it was still very good and only ~$6. \u00a0  Chili over Rice - This is ~$7 which is expensive for the amount of chili you get (not that much). But it was definitely memorable with big pieces of meat and beans. Delicious (albeit expensive) side order.  Pastrami Sandwich - This I thought was excellent. Probably some of the best pastrami I've ever tasted.   Some girls next to us got the Saturday special (short ribs over rice). It looked and smelled so good. Definitely coming back.   Other notes: It's an official landmark and really sticks out of the neighborhood. Great food and quite cheap.",

However, my +1 had the BBQ beef on sourdough, which made me instantly sorry I ever cheated on cows with a mere bird. \u00a0The sauce, served on the side in a little metal pitcher, elevated some pretty damn good beef to orgasmic levels.

The is a staff that takes bar orders, but they are super slooooow. I was almost done with my food before my beer showed up. It was a fun/interesting environment though and it was listed in our guidebooks as a \"local favorite\" which by the number of ppl there on a Monday night, I'd say is true. It was a pretty good mix of families/tourists and people who had clearly stopped in on their way home from work.   The food on the other hand is far from unique. That isn't to say the food is bad, it just doesn't stand out at all. I got the turkey platter with mash potatoes, a salad and a roll. My friends all got basically the same thing, and we all laughed that it reminded us of a (bland) Thanksgiving dinner. They did give us a very generous portion of turkey though.",

Didn't get sides because the sandwiches were plenty enough. However, did help ourselves to the barrell of pickles. The cornbeef itself was kind of too salty when eaten by itself but when eating it sandwich style - tasty, the bread helped. It came with a side of Au Jus which makes the sandwich even better and moist. The bread (sandwich roll) was really good!!! Something about the yeast in that bread was just.... satisfying.

Here there's a very dimly lit bar to the left, a packed dining restaurant in the middle and upstairs, and the cafeteria bar of glistening hot food on the right. As soon as you step inside you're greeted with the menu. I love seeing giant slabs of meat, giant buckets of sides, and lots and lots of gravy. Mmm.  I ordered a giant turkey leg, which came with a salad and bread. It also came with a side of stuffing, but I was pretty meh on the stuffing. The turkey was very juicy on the outside near the skin, but rather dry on the inside. No matter, I ended up not eating the inside and just gobbling down part of my boyfriend's giant open faced ground chuck steak sandwich that came covered in thick gravy and sliced mushrooms. That was so good - savory and gooey. Yum!  I love the giant barrel of pickles too. It says take all you want but only what you can eat. I took probably a bowl full, and ate it all. Yes!",

It was in my list of places to go to but it wasn't a for sure spot to visit. We were on the bus and one of my friends saw it and point it out to me. Since we were right there..we just got off the bus and decided to order a sandwich to go.  I'm so glad we stopped! I had a pastrami sandwich on a french roll....and hmm I loved it. It was one of the best pastrami sandwiches ever!! The meat was juicy and tender and literally melted in my mouth!

    "review_text": "I left my heart in San francisco...and it's okay, because I might of had a heart attack.  Drenched with delicious gravy and more inviting than most soup kitchens.  San Francisco host Tommy's joint a wonderful affordable place with hearty portions that even a homeless person can afford.   This recession friendly place has been a staple for the blue collar worker and looks as if it was a tavern or den that host Vikings or warriors, yet one of the best affordable sand-which places and good eats.  I've been here several times, It Is my go-to place in San Francisco since the hours it seems as if its open for late night (until 1pm) with it's wooden old-school cafeteria style atmosphere.   The portions are American style stewed meaty dishes.  The Buffalo stew is awesome, but I almost always take the Turkey leg, Yesterday when I went I has the Turkey Sloppy Joe.  Everyday there are different special featured.  It was delicious, My heart still pumps the taste of the richness in my veins. It's a very manly place, I know I enjoy it because I am a manly man,  not saying women won't enjoy this place, but she has to be a cool girl, this is not really a \"date\" place to my standards,  unless you date doesn't mind being seen in public without makeout.  This place has a awesome bar and TVs  playing the game as if it was the world contact to the real world outside... Truly, this place is a world of it's own.  The downside It's also not a place with a selection of veggies,  for my herbivore friends.  but I dare you to try EVEN as a plant licker a piece of meat and you would be converted into a meat-eater so quick, \"Peta\" will slap you in the face.  Pro-tip - Cash-only",

Your first sense that is overloaded is sight. Just the outside of the building is a spectacle of itself. Really rad artwork and a huge ass sign. You can go by this place without noticing it. Which is I think is intriguing. You see all these bright colors, and ginormous and you want to know what exactly is going on inside.  Upon entering there was a line about 15 people deep and the whole place was packed! It was nice to see people chatting and enjoying the food, always a pleas er. Observing this I knew I found a gem. Reviewing the menu they had the standard deli menu. Corned beef, pastrami, tongue, turkey, etc. And every day they have a daily dinner plate special, which is nice. I walked up to the counter, ordered the corned beef, and watched them slice it right in front of me with a knife, and not a meat slicer which is always appealing. I paid, got my soda and they offer unlimited pickles at the end of the bar, awesome!  I finally took my first bite. Juicy, tender, perfectly cooked corned beef on a very nice soft and chewy roll that soaked up all the delicious juice of the beef. I was fully satisfied after one bite! Enjoying my sandwich I was looking around the restaurant. Really cool decor, a cool crowd and a full bar, which is always a plus. I was very pleased with my meal, my surrounding and was almost ready to order another sandwich although I was full, it was just that good!!  My meal was over and so it's time to go, aw man!! I had such a blast at this Joynt! Definitely check this place out if you're ever in San Fran. Just a quick heads up it's cash only.",

So I ended up going for the top round beef on sourdough and corned beef on rye (half for me, half for my Matt N.)...knowing that I would soon need to come back to just quell my curiosity.  After taking my seat upstairs with my meal in hand, I sat next to a very diverse crowd of businessmen in suits, mechanics in jumpers, and constructions workers with hard hats in tow, all having in common one thing: hunger. \u00a0Hunger for a freaking hearty meal of meat.  The corned beef was really fantastic, definitely a step above most delis in LA. \u00a0I mean, they obviously must make it in-house and take time in preparations. \u00a0You can taste a difference. \u00a0However, one bite into the top round sandwich instantly ablated my indecisiveness. \u00a0Holy god this was good. \u00a0The chewiness of the sourdough alongside the tender meat with droppings of fat dotting its edges hit the spot. \u00a0But the Jus is where I almost lost it. \u00a0I couldn't pour enough of it on the sandwich. \u00a0It was the first time I've ever tested the absorbency of bread on a sandwich. \u00a0Sure it got soggy. \u00a0Who cares? \u00a0It was so delicious that I almost ordered another sandwich just to use the rest of the beefy, brown concoction.  So I will definitely be back for another try, especially for them lamb shanks. \u00a0Cause my curiosity of missed food can only be shut up for so long.",

We stopped here after finding quite a few places closed on a Sunday afternoon. My first impression was this would be a good spot for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and then I saw the little placard announcing they had already been on there.  With all the different choices, I took a good 10 minutes to decide. Everyone's plates around me were full of bread, mashed potatoes, huge stacks of meat and bowls of beans. I ended up getting a corned beef sandwich with swiss cheese. Actually, 3 of the 4 of us got the same exact thing. The 4th person got a meatball sandwich.  While ordering it was kind of hard for them to hear us over the football game on the television. Not a big deal but I didn't appreciate the cashier interrupting me a couple of times while still communicating my order to the meat carver. The only glitch in our short visit. Again, not a big deal. The waitress at our booth was very sweet and attentive. The meat was carved perfectly with only a few specks of fat. It was moist, flavorful and stacked just high enough that you could wrap your mouth around the meat and the perfect sourdough roll. The au jus on the side was VERY tasty. I usually just like a little mustard on my corned beef but I found myself dipping into that quite a bit. \u00a0I managed to steal a bite of the meatball sandwich and it was really good. The marinara and meat were seasoned just right and melted in my mouth. The servings are all huge. There is no way you can leave this place hungry!

Tommy's Joynt, located in the heart of San Francisco, is simply one-of-a-kind. Cafeteria style eats serving huge slabs of slow, savory, and beautiful cooked meats ready to be craved before your very eyes. The only problem I always have.. is unsure of what succulent meats to gorge on!   Hot Pastrami Dinner Plate - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=abC2EQN24Y8JXb4rCYu-ow&amp;userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a> What's for dinner? PASTRAMI. I EFFIN' LOVE PASTRAMI and Tommy's knows wsup. Hot, tender, heavenly slices of flawless meat-to-fat pastrami, seasoned to perfection, and smoked in all it's own natural juices. Don't you dare add sauce on this meat, or I will find you! Best of all, they pound the meat on your platter! One can't have too much pastrami.  Beef Brisket Dinner Plate - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gumkJTkpWuu0HvGSRUdmbw&amp;userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a> Meat that melts in your mouth; it can rival House of Prime Rib in all its glory, and with only a fraction of the price! All dinner plates come with a dinner roll and your choice of mashed potatoes, baked beans, or a side salad. (wait, EFF salad, MORE BEEEF!) Just don't forget to apply some of their table-side Spicy Mustard for that intense horseradish flavor!   Pastrami Sandwich -  My favorite \"On-the-Go\" option at Tommy's. The same great pastrami, piled high, on your choice of sourdough, white, rye, or wheat. (Go for the sourdough!) Don't forget to ask for a cup to grab some of their homemade pickles! (It's in the barrel next to the fountain!)  Buffalo Chili -  Made in-house but WTF are you getting chili for? The chili is slightly pricey ($6+) and really, ain't that great. A lot of beans, minimum buffalo meat, and didn't have any spicy kick. You should slap yourself for ordering this (because I sure did..).  Clam Chowder -  Who doesn't visit San Francisco without grabbing a cup of Clam Chowder, amiright? Sure, it's quite the story to say you ate it out of a bread bowl, but forget that tourist trap, and get it at Tommy's! The chowder doesn't have much clams but is creamy redefined, and paired with a house dinner roll, it's the same exact thing!   Grubbing at Tommy's Joynt, which is family owned and badass since 1947, will not disappoint. The meals ranging from only $5 to no more than $10 is too unbelievable. A meal cheaper than 2 gallons of gasoline, WTF! Daily specials also available or opt to try something new and hey, as long as your plate is succumbed with meat, you can't go wrong!",

Really, the service staff and huge beer list made up for the over-hyped food. \u00a0Maybe I just came on a bad day, because Tommy's seems like one of \"the\" places to go in SF. \u00a0Ambience/decor/people-watching are all top notch - even the busboy was funny! \u00a0The dog and multiple beggars were friendly as well.  But the food... the lamb shanks and brisket had great flavor, but both were way overcooked (possibly sitting under lamps too long?). \u00a0Coincidentally, the turkey sandwich was dry, too. \u00a0The jus for dipping was very salty and lukewarm; it did little to help the turkey go down. \u00a0Sides were good, but I'd like to see lower prices for slaw and some sides (all are $2.50). \u00a0Free rolls with meals are average quality. \u00a0Mustard on table was too scary looking to try (definitely had been in that jar for a while).  I liked the cafeteria style service and free pickles yet will need to revisit Tommy's to reevaluate my rounding conundrum.",

Well, this place serves it fresh, I don't know about school food..... \u00a0And then you pick an available table to sit.   Babe and I each got a Roast Beef Dinner Plate which also comes with a choice of mashed potatoes or veggies, beans or salad, and bread&amp;butter. I grabbed the mashed potatoes, and salad along with the bread and butter.   I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much from the place judging by how they served food, but I was pretty surprised. Food was delicious and pretty darn good for the price. \u00a0Roast beef was extremely juicy, and the mashed potatoes were pretty good too, but I doubt that anyone could mess up on that. The salad, and bread with butter was okay though.  Overall, not a bad place, definitely a good place to go to grab a quick bite if you're near the area.",

I recommend getting the brisk with a side of mash potatoes. Do the dinner special and then you get a side of salad and a roll all for under ten bucks.  As mentioned this place can get really crowded. The best time to go here is for a late lunch or an early dinner. During these hours you can always find an empty table upstairs.   For the first timers upstairs is the best place to eat. There is a lot more room up there and you can enjoy your food over a nice conversation.  Highly Recommended. This is one of the Must Eat At Restaurants in San Francisco.",

A fully loaded bar, might I add, stocked with a diverse assortment of beers, wines, and liquors. Although Jessi and I merely ordered Budweisers, it was impossible to ignore the selection of drinking options at hand.   The inside of this \"sandwich and cocktail stop\" is remarkable, very San Francisco in both a tourist and tenderloin sense. The bar sits across the room from the meat counter, where you order your meal, receive it on a plastic tray, and then sit at one of the long tables in between. A server either takes your drink order or you can mosey up to the bar and order for yourself. Our bartender was an older gentleman dressed in a white shirt and black vest, looking quite dapper, I might add; however, a bit later into the evening another bartender arrived wearing a polo shirt and jeans, causing me infer that the first bartender just chose to wear his fancy clothes for the hell of it. And I find that incredibly charming.  What else? The walls are plastered with signs, posters, and everything under the sun; even the ceiling houses some select paintings and decorations. The bathrooms are upstairs, off of a small balcony that overlooks the utter beauty that is Tommy's Joynt. They have those novelty sex toy machines (at least in the ladies room), and for a mere 75 cents I purchased a \"blow job enhancer.\" Which I have to say was pretty sweet, since I've been in the market.  I'm totally going back.",

I ordered ribs here and they pick it out of a huge pan of oily brown watery liquid that the meat has been sitting in for god knows how long and I get a nasty grisly piece of fat attached to a bone.

Also, there's this amazing thing nowadays called, spices. They make things taste good. Use them.   I've eaten here about 5 times and every time I have almost vomited and eaten like 5 bites.   I am not a fan of nasty cafeterias. I am not a fan of flavorless fat and soggy veggies.   Also the guys who serve your food are rude. I point to one area of soggy meat and ask, what's that? They look at me like I'm an idiot and say, \"Lamb.\" Um... am I supposed to know what meat's are what by the amount of brown in them?

Food is inexpensive, both in quality &amp; cost...read; this place was meant to feed the masses with massive portions and inexpensive booze.

But if you're hungry for a sandwich, you will not be disappointed. The sandwiches look small, but they will fill you up. Just make sure to get a side of potato salad, and a big side of pickles (you help yourself for pickles from the giant keg of pickles to the left of the register). ***Note to sandwichers: if you're leaning towards the round of beef, you're better off getting it on a plate. The round of beef is super rare and it's a challenge to take bite sizes from a sandwich. You'll need a knife to get though the delicious rare meat***  Drinks are relatively cheap. Getting a full meal feels like you're stealing from Tommy because it's so cheap.   If you go and it's crowded, don't be afraid to pull up a chair at someone else's table. Thats how they do here.

Tommy's is a SF institution, great for everything except the food which is very neutral middle of the road stuff. The pickles are free but standard jarred fare. Some of the food is not that cheap so may as well order a hot dog or the specials since the eating experience will be the same.   In fact if Tommy's wasn't in SF I'd give it one star less, but here it's a great palate-cleanser between your meals of raw kampachi and artisanal organic cheese. It's a part of \"old\", Harry Bridges-style San Francisco and in fact it might be a good idea to eat there on July 5 in commemoration of the union busting \"Bloody Thursday\" in 1934.

    "review_text": "Yes, please. A San Francisco staple. When you walk into a place and the first thing you see is a long line and a sign that says \"Cash Only\" you know it must be good. After reading some reviews my partner and I decided that we would walk a few blocks and find out why this place was so special. There wasn't a long long when we walked in, probably because we went at an odd hour, but I would've waited in a line twice as long for the food.   We both ordered the exact same thing, bbq brisket with mashed potatoes and a salad with ranch dressing. The order came with a roll (carbs, my favorite!). First off, the brisket was melt in your mouth, pure deliciousness. Even if the mashed potatoes were made from a box, it felt like they were made from scratch with lots of love. I could eat them for days. The salad was a salad, nothing special, but the roll was carbalious.  Of course we had to have a drink. My #1 choice is ketel &amp; soda. I'm all about getting doubles and triples, but I have to draw the line at quads and quints. The drink was extremely over-poured and was basically un-drinkable. I wasn't wanting to get completely drunk off one drink. Luckily they were having a special of all ketel one drinks for only $5 which was pretty amazing. Just watch the pour or go in expecting to get drunk off a few drinks.   If you're in San Francisco, uber, walk, ride, fly, do whatever you have to do to visit this place. It's worth it. Worth every star.",

Since we had been drinking and could not drive, and since your joynt was only about 6 blocks from our hotel, you were the perfect spot for a super late night dinner. If it was not for you, my friends and I would have went to bed hungry, which would have sucked.  Thanks again  Your pal, Craig R   That's right, you read correctly, Tommy's Joynt actually stays open until 2am, 7 days a week. Tommy's is a large, cash only, bar/restaurant that looks more like an old cluttered garage than it does a restaurant. Tommy's Joynt has all dark wooden walls and tables. The wooden walls are plastered with old pictures, antique beer steins, Christmas lights and lots of other kooky decorations. To get your food at Tommy's you have to wait in a cafeteria style line that is usually pretty long. Tommy's does not offer paper menus. Instead, \u00a0Tommy's list their menu on the wall above their kitchen, which is where you place and pick up your order.   Tommy's is definitely a carnivore's paradise. Their menu consists of things like buffalo stew, BBQ turkey sloppy joes, steak sandwiches, corned beef, lamb shank and many, many other delicious sounding carnivorous platters. Well, to be honest, I wish I would have gone with one of the items I just mentioned because the dish I ordered was not that great. I ordered their burgundy beef with white rice. Tommy's BB is made with big beef chunks, potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and celery in brown gravy. The meat in this dish was not really flavorful and was kind of tough. The sauce and veggies were good though. I also got a side salad and a side of coleslaw. Both of these were standard, nothing to write home about. I did happen to try some of my friends buffalo stew and it was phenomenal. The buffalo meat was really flavorful and juicy. I also had a chance to sample my friends beef brisket and it too was just average but still better than my burgundy beef.   The prices at Tommy's Joynt are dirt cheap. My entire meal with a lemonade was around ten dollars. Nothing on their menu seems to be over ten bucks, which is almost unheard of these days. The service is also amazing here. The long line moved quickly and since the food is served cafeteria style your order is given to you almost immediately after it is ordered.   Since my friends buffalo stew was so good and since everyone raves about their BBQ turkey sloppy joes I will definitely return to this joynt next time I'm in SF.",

    "review_text": "My husband and I stopped here late one night after leaving a club. \u00a0We'd been wanting to stop here for ages and we weren't disappointed!  You walk in and the place smells like my grandma's house used to! \u00a0Funny thing was that the smell was beefy, and it made me really want the turkey! \u00a0But, we were sharing so we compromised. \u00a0This NOT a place for vegetarians! \u00a0Their meat is the main draw.  We shared the corned beef plate. \u00a0It came with mashed potatoes and a salad. \u00a0The place was packed at 1 am on a Friday night, but it was still comfortable. \u00a0We weren't drinking, but HOLY CRAP they have a HUGE assortment of imported beers. \u00a0We had to wait in line quite a while because the place is cafeteria style, but at the same time, you don't wait for the food to be cooked and brought to you. \u00a0  The corned beef was very tasty. \u00a0Very tender - not like OMG the best ever, but well worth getting again. \u00a0The mashed potatoes tasted beefy in a pleasant homey way. \u00a0Like they were made with beef drippings of beef broth. \u00a0  The funny thing was the thousand island dressing. \u00a0Dunno what it was about it, but yum! \u00a0Not a strong flavor but uber tasty!  I'm trying to think of another reason to go here again! \u00a0You have to admit, braving Van Ness parking can be a pain.",

    "review_text": "Got the turkey dinner....was pretty good, no lie, definitely rivals Lefty's turkey dinner.    \u00a0Both white meat AND dark meat, stuffing at the bottom, potatoes and gravy were delish, and hiding at the bottom of this mound of food is stuffing!! Sourdough roll to boot, Thanksgiving in February without those a-holes we call family. \u00a0  I don't even know where to fit this in - it's not a complaint just an observation that the others I was with think I'm crazy but - I am a huge Costco fan, have been a diehard fan for 7 years since I got my first Costco card at 18.....and I am 90% sure the potato salad here is Costco potato salad. \u00a0It's totally cool if it is, I'm sure other people like it, but if anybody in the kitchen at Tommy's is reading this and you do indeed use Costco potato salad - it's fine, I GET it, that huge tub for gosh what $6.99? That serves 50? \u00a0Understandable. \u00a0However, if you are going to serve other bomb-ass food and then throw Costco potato salad on it, you better at least make it your own by mashing it some more, adding more veggies, BACON, dry mustard powder, not just as-is from the Costco container right to the serving plate!   If this potato salad is NOT Costco potato salad, then my stance is that the potato salad tastes like Costco potato salad.",

    "review_text": "After reading all of the good reviews, and seeing the mouth watering pictures on yelp, le boyfriend and I ventured here while we were in SF (senior ditch day tehe!).  Though I love the character and personality that this place has, I was a bit disappointed.  I ordered the beef brisket dinner plate, which was sooo yummy and tender. The sauce they pour over it was good too! Nice and tangy. The mashed potatoes were mediocre.  My bf got the pastrami sandwich on sourdough and that's where the problems begin. The meet was boring to me, and it was just bread and meat. I would have no problem with this if the meat was super juicy or had intense flavor, but nope. The au jour or w/e didn't help much.  My salad was drenched in watered down ranch, and his clam chowder was also watered down.   Our water was milky.. a big no no.  The guys behind the counter are super nice and efficient, the carver threw in an extra piece for me!  I want to come back and try other things, i'm not giving up on you yet!  Also, cash only! They do have an ATM machine available but it charges $2.00 -_____-",

The meat is tender and flavorful and they have a few selections to choose from. Had the brisket dinner plate with mashed potatoes, dinner roll, and two bowls of Clam Chowder all for less than 20 bucks. The clam chowder was pretty damned good too! This was a perfect meal after catching a movie at the AMC 1000, especially since we already had parking. I can imagine it can get pretty busy here but there are plenty of tables and a couple of booths for seating. Though be ready to carry your food to the table cafeteria style. Oh yeah...CASH ONLY :( \u00a0 (Really!? In this day and age?)",

The lack of credit cards kind of stinks and it takes a little while to get a drink but the food makes up for it. If you don't mind waiting in line for 10-15 to get your food it's worth it.",

So a couple times I decided to go and try their food since it does look pretty good. Parking over here is already bad and need to be careful of all the guys fly across Van Ness and up Geary. You swear you are standing on the freeway.   My mistake on both times. The first time the food just didn't taste good and was just lousy meal for the amount I paid. The second time I thought I would try something different and had a different result. I walked out of there with diarrhea.",
