We tried to host a birthday party here on a pretty weather day, but it was really hard to get people to stay because of the lines. We also tried to contact the management 3 times to this location and no one ever returned our calls (big disappointment) even if just to tell us they don't take reservations.

They also bring in food from Suppenk\u00fcche from down the street. That's a huge plus.  The only drawback is the huge line. Since the place opens at 3:00pm, the line usually wraps around the corner by 2:50pm. The longest part of getting your drink will be waiting in line. If you come closer to sunset (also when it's colder), you'll get your drinks faster. Good luck coming on a warm and sunny day ~ even though these are the best days to come.

We're from LA, where people don't do communal, so it was nice just to sit and BE with other people--- I noticed a distinct diversity in ages, races, orientations, families, etc. Also, people actually spoke to each other... rather than getting lost in their cell phones. Wonderful to see.  Fun way to spend a couple of hours and great for those new to SF. If I lived here, I'd definitely come back and bring out-of-towners.",

There is only one line and one bar. The line later in the day got to be about 25 minutes. The first time we got small beers ($8) because we were afraid the big ones would get warm.

I hope this will create opportunities for more restaurants/bars like this one  We arrived right at 3pm when the Biergarten opened and waited in line for about 30 minutes to get in, then waited another 20-30 minutes for a beer and a pretzel. \u00a0Kind of a long wait, but the place is new and I'm hoping they will work out a better way to handle the flow of people in/out/serving beers.  The staff was beyond friendly and a bit apologetic about getting things going with the new space. \u00a0Totally understandable. \u00a0The beers were big and delicious and the pretzels really hit the spot. \u00a0I did not have a sausage, but will definitely go back for one. \u00a0  It's not uber cheap (two giant beers came to approx. $21) but I guess that's just what giant beers go for in Hayes Valley. \u00a0  The atmosphere is still a little bleak - it's basically a chain link fence around a parking lot with picnic tables and a few trees for shade. \u00a0However, it looks like vines are being grown on the fence and the trees will fill out. \u00a0Lots of potential!",

FOOD: Who doesn't love pretzels and beer?! If you are a weirdo who doesn't like beer, wine is also available for 6 bucks a cup (literally served in a cup). I recommend a liter of Munich Gold ($14) and a cheese knot (like a grilled cheese with shallots on an amazing fresh pretzel roll, $6) Lactose intolerant? Get the frankfurter on an equally amazing fresh pretzel bun with a sour kraut topper and spicy brown mustard-heaven! Anything you order will be delicious. Even if you are allergic to calories and order a kale salad-still awesome!!   SETTING: Outdoor wooden benches situated in what looks like a parking lot with a chain link fence around it. Everything is served out of grey boxy bungalows and gives it a very industrial vibe. When the sun goes down and the temp drops, they have blankets available for those unprepared for SF weather. So thoughtful!   TIPS: Bring money for the meter (they charge on Sundays now) and a deck of cards for fun drinking games if the conversation is lacking. Get there early! By 2pm, the line tends to extend past the gates and seating will be hard to come by as people like to camp out for the afternoon.",

I've also tried a few dishes - Pickled plate - I had no idea ginger can be pickled, same with carrots, garlic, and a few other things. Frankfurter - yummy sausage served with sauerkraut and a house dijon mustard. Pork Risette dish - which is served on pieces of toast and topped with mustard seeds and chopped chives. Everything was delicious and great for an afternoon snack/early dinner.

If you can get past the crowds and grab a table then this is a pretty cool place to drink the day away. The beer is good (and comes in steins) and everybody seemed good natured and relaxed. Apparently the food is really good too.",

The eggs were dyed a bright, artificial pink, not too sure what the point of this was aside from wow factor. They were darn tasty though. Beer was good as well.  It's always nice to be able to enjoy beer outside, although it was pretty chilly that day. We did notice that the employees were handing out blankets to whoever wanted to bundle up some more.

    "review_text": "Spent a lot of time standing in line for a beer whilst discussing San Franciscans predilection for standing in lines. Some places in this fair city are worth the wait -- Tartine and Bi-Rite Creamery come to mind -- but Biergarten is not one of them. While those other establishments create a product that is simply superior to other offerings in the city, Biergarten serves a limited selection of mediocre beer (it is German, after all) and good (not great) food. Special shout out to the delightfully pickled deviled eggs, and the pretzels are legit, but it's tough to justify some of the prices for the other menu items.  I do really like the aesthetic of this place. Some people might get turned off because they feel like they're drinking beer in what amounts to a glorified parking lot, but I think it has an inviting, urban park charm. It benefits from a thoughtful, modern industrial architecture where the kitchen, bar, and bathrooms are all built in giant gray shipping containers (very cool), the tables are simple and sturdy, and the openness of the space affords ample people watching.   But man, that line! Would you go to a bar if I told you that you had to wait thirty minutes every time you wanted another beer? I doubt it. The food is better than the beers at this place, and the food line is generally short and easy to navigate, but you want your beer to keep flowing if you're settling in for an afternoon at a place like this, and it just doesn't. Some reviewers think it's a glaring operational problem, but I'm quite sure the management likes it the way it is. Why would they feel the need to change their service style if there is a never ending 30+ minute line full of patrons willing to wait it out? It undoubtedly creates turnover at the tables and helps to keep customers drunkenness levels in check.   I love outdoor day drinking as much as the next guy, and there is obviously serious demand at this place. I just think I'll take my talents to someplace like Zeitgest or Lucky 13 instead and head back to order my second (much tastier) beer from the bar as quickly as it would take you to get one less flavorful offering from Biergarten. That line is for suckers.",

On the other hand, their beers are moderately priced. A 1/2 liter will cost you around $6-8, and they have a good selection of beers. I tried the Stiegl Pilsner and it was great!

We stood in line for about 20 minutes because they were controlling the flow of people going into the area and making sure it wasn't getting crowded near the bar and food service stations. The wait was well worth it minus the fact that they were out of 3/6 beers they had available. Given it is the end of Oktoberfest, they should have been more prepared especially since it was only about 6pm and they opened at 3pm earlier that day. All that aside, I got myself a monster stein of Paulander Oktoberfest and I loved it. It's a pretty malty beer with slight hops, its an amber ale so expect it to be a little richer than a pilsner but less than a brown ale. Overall a great beer, although it's only in season during Oktoberfest. I'd definitely go here again because the ambiance and good vibes are worth it.",

On a sunny day in Hayes, it's hard to beat chilling and drinking beer with your friends and other locals in a communal outdoor setting. The one liter steins, brimming with beer certainly encourage feelings of joy as you bs the rest of your afternoon away with friends till your hungry. I mean sure, you can be productive with your day but why would you?  Meat knot? What's that? I don't care. It tastes good &amp; bring me another stein please.  If you can't get enough of Biergarten, you should check out their sister restaurant Suppenkuche which is also in the neighborhood. They have delicious food and DAS BOOT, two whole liters of beer ready to help you stay tipsy. Watch the movie \"Beerfest\" for inspiration.",

It was an absolutely wonderful decision and the sun was shining brighter than it had before I started drinking.   So point of the story. Don't be a wuss and double fist some steins. I promise it isn't lonely on the floor.   Five stars for atmosphere (cute as hell), beers, food, bathrooms (so cute).

We wanted to go somewhere with alcohol. Somewhere in the city. She then stumbled upon an article on Thrillist that mentioned something about beer served by the liter...and that's how I found myself at Biergarten.   We thought we arrived early. To our surprise, there was already a pretty substantial line of hipsters and it was a bit of a wait to find a seat.   Admittedly, I'm not exactly a fan of most of the beers they serve here (more of a fan of American craft beers), but considering the venue, I wouldn't want to drink anything other than German beer. They do have a limited tap list. You can probably find something you'll like, though. As for me, I was really looking forward to drinking a dunkel (dark lager) since I haven't had a dunkel beer in a while, but they were out. Ended up with a liter of Schneider-Weisse ($16) which was okay. My friend and I also split the pork belly sliders ($9). The bread was fluffy, buttery, and nicely done. I really am a stickler when it comes to choosing the right bread for a sandwich and Biergarten did it right! The pork was tender and pretty flavorful. I liked that red cabbage slaw too. Overall, it was a great slider but not very filling for the price.   As for the seats, unless you are in a large group, you're probably going to be sharing one of those tables with a group of strangers.   Oh. And if you want another beer or more food, you'll have to fall back in line...which wouldn't be that big of a deal if the lines weren't so long.   Anyway, this place is pretty cool. I'll definitely come back for another liter and maybe one of those delicious looking prezels since the weather is nice right now. \u00a0If you're interested in getting some small german bites with large steins of german beer and \u00a0don't mind waiting in line or paying high prices, then I recommend that you stop by sometime!",

I was lucky enough to secure a table for my group before the crowds started to form, but if you're not lucky, you're gonna be standing for your entire stay here. Beer here only comes in two sizes - half liters and liters, and the selection is quite poor. Food selection is also quite poor, but that wasn't a big deal to me since I normally just order beer and pretzels. My take on the pretzels? Subpar. You will find pretzels that are 10 times better than the ones here at Jamber.

They have a handful (3-4) of German beers on tap that you can get in massive-sized glasses if you want (bitte, $15!). \u00a0Toronado and Rosamunde Sausage Grill (the one on Mission) have the same or better selection of these types of German beers. \u00a0Even The Uptown on Capp St. usually has some nice Paulaners.  As for the food, the sausage was undercooked (still pink on the inside!) and didn't even come with a bun -- for $9!. \u00a0Rosamunde Sausage Grill's sausage is ten times better at 2/3 the price. \u00a0Heck, Rosamunde's BUN is by itself better than anything I had at Biergarten.

Biergarten is proof that you can take mediocre food, a handful of common German beers that are available elsewhere, overprice it all by 50% and STILL have people lining up because you put the whole thing outside -- on a slab of parking lot asphalt surrounded by a chainlink fence. \u00a0\"Oh, we have a biergarten in SF... how Europeannnnnn!\"",

Biergarten is exactly what its name implies, which is essentially an casual, fun outdoors gastropub that serves up an eclectric menu of German favorites like Bratwurst with fresh pretzles, maple syrup bacon bread pudding and wide array of drinks. They are currently in the process of expanding the business so expect longer hours during the coming summer. My friend and I had very fortunately stumbled upon Biergarten on our way to Chantal Guillon for macaroons, while waiting to be seated for dinner. Both of us decided to return after our dinner reservation for late night (~7pm) spirits and snacks. Although they were bustling with people around dinner time, the crowd began to thin down when we got there...so there was no line and plenty of blankets, seating available. And now I can proudly say that we were very happy with this decision!  There were 2 draft beers, 2 wines offerings that evening with several snacks. We decided on a white dessert wine, Pilsner and maple syrup bacon bread pudding to share. Everything was delicious, although the bread pudding was a little burnt at the bottom. Our Pilsner was big enough to be shared between the two of us. The warmly lit ambiance and complimentary blankets offered a nice shelter against the chilly winter night, overall making the scenery extremely sweet and comfortable...to the extent in which I ended up taking a short nap amidst our talking, snacking and drinking. Overall, it was the icing on top of great evening. Even though I didn't eat here...judging by the hungry bites my fellow customers were taking, the menus would definitely be worth exploring! The portions of their entrees may not filling enough for dinner but would serve as generous snacks to pair with drinks. I would say that this is a great place to for a laid-back hangout with friends on a weekday night, after work, or weekend. Good choice! Will definitely be returning with more friends",

We were still feelin' the German beers, and the weather was perfect outside, so we staked our claim on one of the picnic tables. We got there around 9pm and it wad still pretty crowded, but we managed to find a free table pretty easily.   The outdoor space is pretty cool, with a few shipping container type structures, serving beer and assorted German sausages, pretzels, and other bar food. We ordered our beers, and I ordered the pork belly sliders, which were delicious, including the red cabbage slaw it came with. I would recommend against getting the burger, because although it was delicious as well, it was about the size of one of my sliders and more expensive. The waitstaff is very friendly and they were very efficient with bringing out the food.  I love the raucous beer gardens where everyone is singing and having a good time, but after being a plane for 6 hours, I definitely appreciated how laid-back and chill Biergarten was. If you're looking for an Oktoberfest-type experience, Biergarten might not be the place you're looking for.  The only disappointing thing was how early it closes. 9pm seems a bit early, but I guess, as a sort of a pop-up beer garden, you have to be mindful of the surrounding neighborhood. Anyways, I'm a big fan, and I'll definitely be back for some good German fare and delicious beers.",

I ended up getting two of these. + The food was decent. Better than average, but not amazing. The prices were reasonable, not that expensive, and accurately reflected the value food.  ++ We got pork belly sliders, deviled eggs, and a pretzel. They were all fairly delicious. The deviled eggs are pink!  When we went up for round two of beers, the queue was fairly long and it was quite a wait. Seating is definitely hard. They have plenty of seats, but this place gets packed and popular!  I cannot comment on parking because I biked.  There is no real \"service\" happening here. You buy your beer and then you sit down. Food is brought to you, and your tables bused. Very little interaction, so we'll keep that neutral. It's actually better that way so you can quality time talking with friends without being interrupted.   Good beers, decent food, reasonable prices.

Ambience: This place is basically an empty lot covered in black asphalt and park benches (rumored to have been flown in straight from Germany). The two buildings are basically converted storage containers. You sit where you can, and usually random people share tables. Me likey as fun social place.  They day we went there was also a band playing dressed in funny german outfits. I heard they volunteer and get paid in beer.   Only four beers on tap and very limited menu, but if you're going to be picky about those types of things, go to a sit down resturatant or the Yard House.

Oddly specific, long-winded, and tedious, but honest.  Your first priority should not be getting a table, going to the bathroom, or waiting for friends - it should be getting in line for your beer. My friend and I made the novice mistake of commandeering seats and taking lavatory breaks and suffered the consequences: forty minutes in line waiting to order our drinks. The sun beat down on the back of my neck and ears, freckling my face in a very un-German way as I gazed enviously at the wise folks already sipping their authentic Bavarian brews from steins so full and so heavy they had to be lifted with two hands.  Despite the wait, this place is glorious. Beer (German-brewed tongue-twisters in name and in flavor) comes in liters or half-liters, both of which stay surprisingly, blissfully cold no matter how long it takes you to polish them off. Traditional German fare includes pretzels with horseradish and sharp mustard, sliders, and bright, pickled seasonal things (eggs, grapes, carrots, and cabbage are common menu tenants). You'll probably end up sharing a table community-style with some pretty chill people; you'll probably really wished you'd paid attention in high school German; you'll probably want to go back again next weekend.",

Once you have your beer in hand, find a picnic table, kick back, and get merry.  And if you happen to get hungry, I'd visit the food trucks parked around the corner before buying food here again. On to the hugely disappointing snacks: I was looking forward to having a nice, warm German pretzel. What I got in return for my $5 was a COLD seeded pretzel with dollops of mustard and nostril-searing horseradish. F that.  Still hungry, I ordered a brat &amp; sauerkraut for $9. Tasty, but no bun so it wasn't as filling as I was hoping. Hey, at least the brat was hot. Still, $9 for a brat is kinda crazy. Is there a ballgame going on here?

I'm not much of a beer drinker but I really loved the Lemon Soda mixed with Beer. It was sweet but still had that grainy beer taste. It was perfect for those rare sunny sf days.

When in SF.... do what San Franciscians do right?   We waiting probably a little over half an hour to make our way to the front. The girl pouring our beer was super nice and knowledgable and informed us of the different brews they had on draft. We even got to sample a few of them! I forgot which one we got, but it was tasty. Two size options: A liter or a half. With my newly found appreciation for clean eating and giving up beer, I opted for the half. Wise choice on my behalf. *Pats on back*  By the time we all got our beers and wine, a table opened up. Score! Then it got chilly the longer we stayed out there. Probably around 5PM. The nice lady that worked there asked us if we wanted blankets. YES! Double score!   Definitely an awesome place to check out!",

Most folks will be friendly enough to scooch a bit for you and your friends (hopefully it's just 1 or 2 only).   I'd definitely spring for an entire 1L stein. \u00a0You think you'd only be game for half a liter... but chances are you're gonna be having a fun time chatting with your friends and sitting al fresco on a warm afternoon... you'll want to stay longer and drink more. \u00a0And it sucks majorly to have to line up again... guarantee another 30 min wait. \u00a0  Speaking of the wait... they need another person behind the taps! 2 cashiers can take the orders and 1 tap master can be dispensing the golden goodness. \u00a0This can hurry along the wait a lot faster. \u00a0But honestly, that'd probably fill this up really fast and there really isn't enough seats for such a big crowd.  As for the food... loved the bratwurst! \u00a0It comes with dijon mustard, horseradish that'll singe your nose hairs, and a giant heap of sauerkraut. \u00a0Though I was bit confused why it had sooo much liquid in the baskets it is served in. \u00a0That could be drained out a little better. \u00a0Brats are moist and flavorful. \u00a0The kraut was great! \u00a0I ate it like it was a side salad!  Deviled eggs were pickled in beet juice... gave it a unique sweet tang. \u00a0I added a goop of horseradish to balance it out. \u00a0Hoo wee!  Waitresses are really fast with serving the food and they're always coming around to pick up your empty dishes/glasses. \u00a0They either do that to replenish for the bar or they want to retrieve those back before it ends up in some TimBuk2 bag (yoink!).

This is such a shame, because the food was surprisingly good. Fortunately, it was not too bad, and neither of us missed work.  Had it not been for the incident with the food, I'd give this place 3.5 stars, maybe 4. The biggest problem is the lines. I don't mind waiting to get into the place (the guy at the door (the owner?) was really friendly and helpful), but you have to go back into that long line to order another beer, as there is no table service nor a separate line for customers already inside. I'd also deduct a 1/2 star for lack of variety. They had Schneider Weisse (yay!), but the other two beers were ok. The Radler is way too sweet for me, but that's a personal preference I suppose. Those were the only options the day we were there.  So my take on this place? If you don't mind the lines, this is a lovely place to spend a sunny afternoon. The communal outdoor benches are great. I'll personally avoid the food, but might be back for a beer. With Schmidt's and Walzwerk not far away, however, I might just go to one of those places to get a better selection of beer.",

By the halfway mark, the sweetness gets to you and it's harder to drink by the minute.   Beware that the line can get VERY long and unfortunately, it's the same line if you want another round. Ain't nobody got time for that! Maybe it's their way of crowd control so that there is not one group that stays forever unless they are really determined to wait in that line again.

I've driven by here so many times and never realized that it was a biergarten because I think the conexes kinda threw me off for something more industrial or something. My friends and I parked our butts here right when they opened at 3pm on a Wednesday and we were enjoying our Spring Break from our intense nursing school program...so we had an excuse to drink in the middle of the day in the middle of the week. For the rest of the folks there, we just had to wonder what folks did for work who drank full liter steins of beer at 3pm.  Anyway, the beer is what you'd expect to find at any fine German establishment. They rotate beers by season and pour in 0.5 liter ($10) or 1.0 liter ($20) glasses/steins. It's too bad they don't sell beer by DAS BOOT! I guess those might break too easily... The only thing that could make this place even more awesome is if the women who work here wore those German biergarten uniforms. But I digress.   The food here looks amazing, but I opted to just go for the beer and pretzels and had bites of my friends' burgers...which was pretty darn good. Next time I'm definitely going to try the pork belly sliders.  Overall, if you've got a big group of folks and want to just chill and hang out during a warm SF afternoon/evening, then come on over to Hayes Valley and sit your butts down here and enjoy a fat brew!",

SF lacks nice places like this to sit outside in the sun and drink a beer, and they are taking advantage of this fact.   When I arrived at the bar they were out of 1L glasses, but more were coming from the dishwasher. The barman twiddled his thumbs for 3 minutes, waiting for the glasses, and not serving anyone else. It seems like they are doing their very best to be as slow as possible. And then they expect a tip!  I'm Irish, so I know effective bar service and the duty a barman has not to make people wait. Employing some general efficiency in your work is a good start. And processing more than one order at a time is effective too; does however require the brainpower to remember more than one drink order. These people show neither interest in happy customers, nor even in making more money quicker for the owners or tips for themselves. Disgraceful. I won't be back.

They don't open until 3pm so you only have about 2 hours of warm sun to enjoy out there. Not sure why they can't open at noon so we can all make the most of the sun and some lunch at Biergarten.  Right now the beer and ID checking lines just combine in to one looong very slow line. Just order the largest beer you can \u00a0because after you wait in that huge line once you will not want to wait in it again just to get another beer.  I have also tried the \u00a0beautiful pink deviled eggs and the pretzels with mustard and horseradish. both are excellent beer snacks. At least they have an extra line so you can pick up snacks without getting in the beer line. They don't have very many beers on tap, maybe 3, but you are really there for the atmosphere.

Yes, the half-liters and liters are pricey, but you're essentially paying for this nice outdoor bar environment. Their snack options, especially the German pretzel, are outstanding. Pricey, but oh so delicious with that special brown mustard they serve. Didn't get to try the pickled deviled eggs, but friends liked it.

The Biergarten is a popular spot, so the line can get pretty long. My advice is order all your beers at once... and if you are contemplating a half v full pint, always go with the big boy.

    "review_text": "Cool outdoor beer garden in a great location. There are not many options for outdoor drinking in the city so this is a great addition right in the heart of Hayes Valley.  There are three German beers on tap ranging from $6 to $9 for half liters and $12 to $18 for liters. There are plenty more bottles available if the beers on tap don't do it for you.  Although when they first opened they did not have many food options they seem to have added to the menu. They have lots of small foods (pretzels, deviled eggs, chive bread, etc) to keep the beer company in your stomach. German sausages are also available if you want something larger but I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are looking for a meal though.  The line consistently looks long but it goes by really fast (5-10 minutes) and you can hop in line before you finish your last beer so you never go thirsty. The major downside is that it is not a very large place and the seating is limited so it can be tough to find a place to sit on a nice day, especially if you are in a group.  Clean bathrooms, pretty cool staff, descent crowd the times I went. Also, they have blankets to give out to people when the weather gets colder.",

RIDICULOUS lines for entry, beer, and food aside, my only real complaint? \u00a0THE BOUNCER...please enjoy my rant.  Saturday 10/22 in SF was absolutely gorgeous, it was in the 80's around 3:30pm when we got in line to get into the Biergarten. \u00a0The line wrapped around the block and took us 20-30min before we got to the front for entry. \u00a0When only one group was left in front of us, we noticed some random guy just walk up to the front of the line (came from the non-line side of the block,) and start searching his pockets for his wallet. \u00a0My bf notices this and actually calls this DB out, \"hey man, are you with someone or are you cutting the line??\" bewildered man's response, \"oh um, i have friends inside...\" disgruntled bf: \"dude i've got friends inside too and i still waited in this line to get in.\" \u00a0so the guy actually acknowledged this and went to the back of the line...score one.  so now we're at the front of the line, and it happens yet again...some b*tch just walks up and shows the bouncer her ID and the bf calls out this woman too... \"hey i just chewed some a**hole out for cutting in front of everyone...you need to wait in like the rest of us.\" \u00a0skank \"oh i have friends inside,\" \"WE ALL have friends inside dude!\" and the girl must've felt entitled and was like \"uh huh\" &amp; whipped her hair at this and proceeded inside. \u00a0At this point we turn to the bouncer and ask if he's gonna keep letting people in and his lame response was \"we just opened a few days ago, we're still figuring stuff out...\" really?? \u00a0i wanted to make the funny/dramatic point that society will start falling apart at the seams if he can't obey the rules of a line. \u00a0i mean really dude, DO YOUR JOB. \u00a0you're gonna have riots (not really,) and disgruntled patrons...this isn't cool.  upon entry into the biergarten, we weren't 5ft in the door when it happened a third time and this time I was fired up and called them out...and yet again the response they felt justified cutting the line because \"we have friends inside.\" man i guess i should've just done that upon arriving too... i had friends inside too but i still waited! grrr...  ok enough ranting already... after all that hooplah, we still had a wonderful time. \u00a0beer line was awful so i can't wait for them to figure that one out. \u00a0i still would totally come back, i love the feel of this place. \u00a0yay beer n pretzels! \u00a0(oh and they said at some point they will be getting a pretzel warmer, yahoo!) \u00a0the pretzel came with mustard and horseradish which i'd never had but was TOTALLY delicious!! \u00a0and the bacon saurkraut? \u00a0FANTASTIC. \u00a0 mmm.... go here, you won't be disappointed.",

I'm always in the mood to go to Biergarten, but then I see the line wrapping around the gates and I end up ditching that plan and going somewhere else. If you do manage to secure a table at Biergarten- first of all, congratulations. That's amazing. Secondly- yes, the prices are a bit steeper than one what expect for an outdoor bar, but the beers are good, the service is quick, and the pork belly sliders are delicious! Also- don't even think of driving here because you'll have better odds of winning the lottery than you will finding a parking spot in Hayes Valley. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, because the negative aspects of Biergarten (like the wait,crowds, lack of parking) are not really specific to the bar, but to the neighborhood itself. So count this as 3 1/2 stars.",

The good: - Conveniently located right off the Freeway - even if you aren't a city dweller, you can find this spot pretty easy. Simply exit at Octavia from 101 and you'll see it pretty quickly. - Parking is easily accessible, even on the weekends. - It's always fun drinking beer out in the sunshine. - Very good beer selection. Not too many choices, but the ones they have on-tap are pretty good. - Fresh baked pretzels to go with your brew. Yummy!  The not-so-great: - As with many outdoor patios, Biergarten gets pretty crowded on a relatively warm, sunny day in San Francisco. You definitely need to be aggressive when it comes to finding a seat. - Their Radler was disappointing. Having spent 3 weeks in Germany as an exchange student, I'm quite familiar with different varieties of lemonade/beer combos. This one wasn't good - way too sweet. Stick to the other drinks on the menu. - Once the sun goes down, it gets pretty chilly this time of year. Bundle up and bring a blanket! You won't regret it.  Overall, a very decent drinking experience in the city. Come with a group of friends and plan on drinking some Litres. Very fun!",

    "review_text": "Took friends visiting out of town to Biergarten for what i think is a very SF experience, arriving promptly at 3pm to find a line formed around the entire Biergarten's fence. Judging from the number of people and the side of the area i was afraid we weren't going to find a table. That worry quickly washed away when i realized we were actually standing in the food line and not purely an entry line. Once they open the doors anyone can walk right in and bypass the line to stake out a table! I highly suggesting splitting your party up - half find a table and half stay in line to order.  I truly believe i spend half my time waiting in lines in the city. Most of the time it's to eat at places like this biergarten where reservations aren't accepted. Almost 45 minutes later we finally place our order! Order all your drinks and food the first round because you will NOT want to get back in line.  The atmosphere is perfect for a laid back group who share a love of tasty beers and german food. It's trendy, in the middle of hayes valley, neighboring Smitten's ice cream and a Blue Bottle kiosk.The wind picks up like mad as the sun starts to dim. Drinking more beer doesn't always keep us warm enough! Luckily they know this at Biergarten and provide heavy duty blankets for us wimps in SF who can't handle a little cold.  Get the pickled deviled eggs, bratwurst with sauerkraut, and pretzels to go around. The horseradish only encouraged me to drink more beer!",

I want to give this place 5 stars but I had to take a star away because of the really long wait in line to order drinks. The line goes all the way outside of the area, so much that when we first got there, I thought it was a line to get in.   The beer is good. You can get one of the large beers for about $16. There's also a bunch of different food here you can eat after drinking. I suggest having one or two people waiting in line. Once that person is close to the front, everyone needs to give their ID's to that person and they would just order all the beers. When we brought the beer back, we didn't give the ID's back to people until they gave us money for their beer lol. It worked out in the end since most people had cash.   There's a bunch of seating but it's good to get here a little early to have someone save seats, it does fill up fast. But people are friendly and don't mind sharing the tables with other people. It was sunny when we came here but there was a slight wind, which made it great. My friend told me on really nice days, this place gets crazy packed. Later on in the early evening it started getting cloudy and chilly. But that's SF for you, so be prepared.   The bathrooms are in the back. The guys restroom is just one room and inside there's the toilet seat and the urinal. The faucet is back outside in middle between the men and women doors.   Overall, this is a great place to day drink, chill and enjoy the weather outside with friends. The wait to order beer/food is a bit long but not too bad if you wait with a friend.  Pros: -1L beers for $16 -Outdoor sitting -Great place to chill with friends  Cons: -Line to order beer/food can take awhile -No music",

When I got here with my cousin and her friend I was expecting the line to stretch out into the sidewalk but it didn't, so the wait time was very reasonable. Also keep an eye out for a space opening up so you can sit down with your glorious liter of beer. When I went to order, the person working the taps was very friendly and helped me choose a beer, even offering me if I wanted to try some to make sure I would like it.   We all got a liter of Edelweiss and that was enjoyable. As for the food (I'm not sure if it was because I was hungry or not) we ordered the bratwurst with sauerkraut and that was pretty delish. Later we asked the server as he was cleaning up our trays what he would recommend. He said that the sliders (cow tongue and pork belly) were good. I was thrown off when he said cow tongue but I just bit the bullet and ate it. It was pretty delicious on my part. Never know unless you try...  I also saw the reviews for Biergarten and saw some contradicting things. The one review saying they couldn't get a knife? There were knifes and forks a plenty! When we ran out of napkins we flagged down a server and he put in more napkins in the cup where it was organized with the forks and knives. And I'm not sick from the food...  Although it was my first time there, some pro-tips to follow by the next time I go: 1. Dress in layers (SF weather can get really cold and windy in an instant). 2. If you start getting cold, they lend out blankets, but get them before they lend them all out!  3. Just get the liter. Don't skimp out on yourself. 3. It'll probably be better to come on a \"off\" day, as in Wednesday or Thursday probably when they open up or later in the evening. I went on a Wednesday at around 6:30PM and it looked like it was dying out around 8PM ish. 4. GO WITH FRIENDS!!!",

Honestly, unless you're chugging the huge glass, why would you get it? Beer is pretty nasty once it's warm, so go with the smaller glass, which is still very big!   This place is located in a great location. There's tons of parking, it's close to muni/bart/freeway and if it's sunny in SF, it'll be sunny here!   Service is ehh... whatever.

None of us had ever been, though we were all intrigued by the Yelp photos of mugs as big as our heads.  We got in line at about 2:45PM-2:50PM (right before they opened), and it had already just turned the corner on the block. They opened at 3PM on the dot, and people immediately either stampeded for the shady tables scattered through the courtyard or moved towards the beer line. By the time we got to the gate, most of the tables were already filled up, so we commandeered what looked like the only empty one left right by the gate itself.  Then, we waited for our beers. It took us about 30 minutes before we even got to order. Not that I ever really mind having to wait, but I should be waiting for beers that I can't find anywhere else. The beers that Biergarten had on tap were ones that you could find at most good, local liquor shops. But whatever, we were here to enjoy the Biergarten for what it was.  At $7-10 a half liter and twice that for a full liter, and with food ranging from another $4-16 (from the knots to the baskets), Boyfriend and I ran up a $42 tab for a liter and a half of beer, a frankfurter with sauerkraut and a bratwurst with curried potatoes. Everything was yummy, but not mouthwateringly rave-worthy.  Overall verdict: a very nice little spot with the potential to be very chill, but a little over-hyped. I would totally go back -- but at the prices they're charging and for what you get in return, I might just grab their beer only instead of snagging something to munch on, too.",

Lines were out the door (or rather fence), but that didn't stop us.  Biergarten is a very simple concept. You get your beer, sit down at a table with your buds, and simply enjoy the blissful world of Hayes Valley around you. Aside from lights and umbrellas, there's no decorations.   Beer selection is minimal, but high quality. For Oktoberfest, they had around 5 different beers, including the famous but mediocre Hofbr\u00e4u Oktoberfestbier and the delightful Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest-M\u00e4rzen. $7 for 1/2L and $14 for 1L. Pretty decent prices for high quality beer.   In addition to beer, you get your choice of typical German street foods. Bratwurst, pretzels, deviled eggs, etc. It doesn't even compare with what you'd find at a festival in Germany, but it's good enough to balance out your beer. I got a Frankfurter, which is served with mustard and sauerkraut. Although it was pretty tasty, it's not worth $8. Most of the food items are heavily overpriced, so I advise you eat before coming here.   The venue gets crowded very easily, especially on a weekend or such a big holiday, so scoping out seats is a must. They could easily put more tables in here. Also, since you're outside, be ready for the temperature changes.   Overall, a great place to enjoy one of Germany's most vital contributions to American society.",

    "review_text": "Biergarten has that classic outdoor patio vibe that's great for hanging out with your favorite homies over a few pints that makes you feel like a viking (the pints make my arms feel tiny and weak). As a derivative of Suppenkuche, it's an extension of the German joint in terms of space, only featuring a much more limited menu. With only a couple lagers to choose from and a small selection of bar snacks (think: pretzels, sausages, pickle jars), Biergarten serves you mostly for a cool outdoor atmosphere when you want to impress your friends from out of town who aren't ready for the grit and grime of a typical SF dive bar. If you want more to taste, I would suggest just going to Suppenkuche down the street instead for a full meal and a better selection of beers. If you're looking to just chill on a rare sunny SF day, this is the place.  Things to know: - On really nice weekends, get there when it opens (3pm) to snag a table before it gets too crowded - They don't have space-heaters, so get cozy with some blankets provided in the far corner - They have 2 stalls of clean restrooms, so drink to your heart's content!",

There's a bunch of picnic tables for you to sit at with friends with lights that they have strung over head for when it gets darker, there's something about those lights that makes sitting out more magical.

Rainy season is upon us and they will be closed. I love Suppenkuche to begin with so I knew there was no way this couldn't be good.  There's a cash only line for pretzels and pickles. The larger line is for everything, including beer and sausages. Though this line can take a long time, it's not that bad if you get yourself a liter to last yourself a while until the next one. I often find myself going to the bar many times throughout the night at a bar, but here, I can settle down with a large liter stein. The pretzel was pretty good, but not the best German pretzel I've had. It was a thin style with mustard and horseradish, comes in seeded or non-seeded versions. The bratwurst with saurkraut was delicious of course, bursting with clear meaty juice.  There are two restrooms that are very clean and roomy. Sinks are smartly located outside. The drinking area is composed of thin picnic tables and thin benches positioned in a radial fashion around a tree. The tables are really close to each other, so you can literally be trapped in the center with the tree if you exit the wrong way. Otherwise, I love the coziness of good company and warm yellow lights on a nippy evening. This really, is a biergarten.  The huge, glaring drawback is that the line to get into the place at all gets long. I understand that this must be nice once you're inside to not have people crowding around you for seats. But still. It's a funny situation. I felt like I was waiting at the border to go to the promise land and that bouncer was US customs. Either that or it felt like prison, but where being in prison was a good thing. Several other people from the inside were at the chain link fence consoling their friends on the outside. I know how this feels because I was on the outside.",

The line moved fast and the beer poured faster. After that, tons of picnic tables or standing room for you to fill in and drink at.  And yes, when it rains, there's almost no shelter (a little bit of covered space but not enough for all) so then you're stuck trying to huddle under or drink your drink out in the cold and wet. Ah well.  I enjoyed this simple, fun little space. Just don't go when it's raining. Which it almost never does. Except yesterday.",

I thought it was just some outdoor randomagical place where strangers cram in with each other onto picnic tables and drain crazy-sized glasses of beer amidst loudness.  We went on Halloween day, which upped the antics that much more. Plus, there was at least one birthday going on. My group had left while I stuck around to sing happy birthday over red velvet(?) cake. There was jack-o'-lantern carving too. But no one had candles, so I turned on the flashlight app on my phone and put it in their pumpkin.  People were super easygoing, including those waiting in the slow-moving bathroom line. Back at the tables, some dude was standing around in a tank top as chilly evening began to fall. I remember asking someone to lend the dude their cape-like thing, and it happened.  I think I got some random phone numbers and business cards too. Happy Halloween. Happy Birthday. Happy Biergarten.",

    "review_text": "On warm, sunny days (the few that SF sees), you'll find Biergarten packed -- so packed that the line to get beer wraps around the block! But in the end, very few things bring as much joy as a liter of good beer with friends in the sunshine. In my book, all the beers are delightful. The razzler (a lemonade and beer mix) is a bit sweet and doesn't have enough alcohol content for me. Yes, this little girl CAN drink :)  Tip #1: If your doom is to wait in a line that wraps around the block (and I've been there before), make your time efficient by grabbing some snack foods from the snack stand (like a pretzel - they're pretty delicious) to make the wait go by faster. Also, waiting in line with friends is always a plus.  Tip #2: If you see that you have about a third of your liter beer left and you feel a tingling sensation in your bladder, be efficient with your time and drink the rest of your beer while you wait in line for the restroom. Sometimes the line for the restroom exceeds the line for beer!  Tip #3: SF weather is fickle. At 3:00, it may seem all sunshiny and warm, but when 5:30 rolls around, it'll be gray and cold, so be prepared and come with a jacket. If you forget and the beer isn't helping you keep warm, Biergarten staff goes around, handing out blankets! How awesome is that?!?!  Tip #4: Don't skimp on the beer. Order a liter (never the half) . . . you DID just probably wait 15-30 mins for it anyway. Make your suffering worth it.",

This location is more like a beer stand/food stand where there are tables you can sit out outside. They are suppose to open sometime next week. Also found out it's an extension of the beer place/restaurant, Suppenk\u00fcche - so if you like that place, you'll def like this place. They had German beers on tap and bottle with different sizes. Didn't try any of the food, but it looked good. A lot of people were eating their pretzels. The outside setting was very nice. Nice place to drink beer and chill in an outside setting with friends. Will come again sometime soon.",

Usually when there's a long wait, it almost always deters me from liking a place as much. Something about Biergarten doesn't do that. Good large beers, good yummy snacks - try to take turns standing in lines, because there's no table service, so you have to go back into line everytime. A great place to just chill with some beers and some food and chill in the sunshine",
