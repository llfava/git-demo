With that said, let's be clear: \u00a0The Willows sits in the western end of SoMa. \u00a0It is a bar where you can hang out, play pool, play cards, eat great bar food, drink exquisite beer. \u00a0It is NOT a pick-up joint. \u00a0It is NOT a place to come and flaunt your latest app. \u00a0It is NOT a place to flaunt yourself or your wares.  LOVE this bar because the staff is relaxed, yet completely dedicated. \u00a0There is a craft beer side of the bar with about 12-14 taps and some nice bottles (for in-bar consumption). \u00a0Excellent tap choices, usually focused on West Coast offerings, but their ability to obtain unusual beers from the East Coast (especially Maine) is impressive. \u00a0Obviously, one of the owners has a special \"in\" with several local breweries because this bar occasionally taps a keg that is only available at Willows, or at its sister bar, The Sycamore. \u00a0They also have macrobrews in bottles for those who drink bad beer (blech ... Why those folks even bother to wake up in the morning, I'll never know). \u00a0  The pub menu is perfect for those who have no guilt about what they will eat while imbibing. \u00a0On a diet? This isn't the bar menu for you. \u00a0Are you a hedonist? \u00a0You have hit the jackpot, buddy, because they grill their sandwich bread in BUTTER before slapping on the meat. \u00a0The OMFC is a hamburger served inside two grilled cheese sandwiches. \u00a0Jackpot. \u00a0Seriously.  I haven't spent much time at the non-craft beer side, but I do see they have a full bar and lots of drink specials. \u00a0That room is much larger, with tables, gaming areas, pool tables and a large standing 'share' table.  Let's also be joyous of the fact that this was one of the first bars in SF to ban Google glasses. \u00a0Keep the glassholes away! \u00a0Thank you, Willows! \u00a0  I highly recommend this bar to folks who live in SoMa and the Mission. \u00a0It's very reminiscent of the way SF used to be. \u00a0And I love that.",

What excited me the most was two-fold. First, the separate bar specializing in craft beers featured a fantastic selection, making for some satisfactory head nods with every new brew I ordered. Second, I love their menu, which had me salivating before ever trying the food. I settled on a DIY burger which comes with lettuce, vine ripe tomato, pickles and mayo. I added some cheddar and caramelized onions. For some reason I thought this would be just another bar where the menu was too clever and health-oriented for its own good, but the burger, like everything else, was clearly designed for someone who loves flavor over concerns about getting fat.   The only downside was the service. We sat at our table for what must have been 30 minutes before figuring out ourselves that our orders must be placed at the bar. The waiter pretty much ignored us except when bringing out food, and even then he had no idea who ordered what. I ordered my burger with the salt and pepper fries but got regular ones, though they were still damn tasty.   Tip: Be sure to stop in for trivia Wednesday nights after 7 pm.

The one bartender blamed it on lack of a second person, which I was fine with. But, when the second bartender came on it was no easier to get a drink. This was a slow Sunday early evening and there were maybe twenty people in the whole bar.  The food was pretty good. Cheaper than most places for a basket of fries and a sandwich. My partner got the sloppy joe and I got the pulled pork. Both just a bit above average and could really be quite exceptional if the bun quality was just a bit better. The fries were well seasoned with salt and pepper. Satisfying with beer, so I was happy.  Pork belly \"donuts\" were really disgusting and I love eating crap like this. First of all, they are not donuts. They are battered chunks of pork, fried and then put into a pool of syrup. They were also really over salted with big chunks of salt.  Tap list is a nice mix of imported and domestic beer, I am always pleased with a few things that pop up there weekly and have gone out of my way to come here to try some of them.  The board games are fun and on a slow day, it's a nice place to bring a few friends and throw a few back. Though, hands down...

The chili cheese fries were pretty good but again nothing special.   They have a happy hour which ends at 7pm (not bad!) but even without the discount the prices are very reasonable. Note they have 2 sections of the restaurant, one serves beer wine and food and the other side serves cocktails. Order on the right side, get a number and find a table.   Enjoy!",

Boasting a full bar and a tasty menu, the Willows is a great spot for a wide audience (some of whom may or may not be your cup of tea), whether you're killing time before a show at Slim's or DNA, or just hanging out.   Order everything at either bar, take a number to your seat and they'll bring the food. If I'm ravenous I get the pulled pork sandwich; for a medium appetite, a couple of sliders will do (my top 3: lamb, fish, and fried chicken w/ tomatoes), or the chicken salad (the low-carb version of the sliders).   Granted, I found out about this place from their (smaller, beer-only) sister bar, the Sycamore, but I don't think I can call myself too biased if I only got to know them from being a regular customer over the last couple years. Run by good people with good hearts (and good taste in music), and in my book that's pretty great.",

Back in my day, you were lucky if they cracked open a Rolling Rock --\u00a0though that used to cost about seventy five cents.

Stepping into the Willows you are greeted almost immediately with a sign listing all their craft beers in their first room. Craft brews from as far reaches as Portland, Maine or as closely hidden as Santa Rosa they have great tasting brews from near and far reaches of the country! My personal favorite is the Allagash Curieux- this bourbon barrel aged ale seems to fit so well with the decor- it just works!  The second room is what my friends and I call the fun and games room! Why? Because the room is set up for as stated earlier- fun and games! There are huge tables with ample seats where those who come in for a drink can also grab some of their favorite board games to test their skills with their friends! To top it all off there's a bar in this room just 10 feet from the board games! So you can hang out and share a tasty drink in the front room or you can take it to the second room and test your wit and creativity with Cards against Humanity (my personal favorite game because I do better when I get more drinks from the bar in me; win -win!).   Lastly, what could make a night better than some good beer, cocktails, and board games? The delicious food! A must have any time I visit is their infamous Pork Belly \"Donuts\"/beignets- warm dough and pork never tasted so good while glazed over with maple bourbon syrup! Other favorites include their fried mac and cheese balls and the simple yet savory salt and pepper fries.   Before you finish the night off, remember to check out their pinball room since next to the board game room. I'm not sure why, but every time I go, I am compelled to play a round or two... when was the last time most of us can remember play pinball? Exactly.   The Willows is definitely a great place to unwind and hangout with your friends over some nice drinks and board game competition-friendly of course! Loser buys the next round!",

I like that the place is sort of split into two, with two bars, but it`s a little too loud to play board games in. I don`t know why I expected it not to be, when I drink, I apparently lose all ability to speak at a reasonable volume. However, the side where the board games and pool table are is louder than the other side, so we just took the games to the quieter side [ which has nice, cushy booths, so it`s even better.] There`s a pretty selection of games to choose from, I just wish that they maintained it better, because most of the ones we tried that came with paper/charts were filled by other people. A few things were also missing from the boxes, here and there. I had a sweet tea drink [alcoholic] and it was really good - not too sweet, which is perfect for me, but if you see the name and get it in hopes that it`s like McDonald's sweet tea or something, it`s not.   3 stars for now, but if I come back sometime, I`d like to try some of the food, and then maybe I`ll add another star.

We walked through to the main room and sat down at the bar.

To eat: Pork Belly Donuts - not really a donut, but deep fried pork belly in batter with sweet flavoring. Incredibly good. I also got the fried chicken and fried catfish slider. I think I just like fried things. Both were served quickly and were really juicy and full of flavor.  What makes this bar awesome is the board games that they have in the place. We played Cards Against Humanity, as well as Jenga with crazy commands on them, like go dry hump the jukebox.  The crowd here is pretty hip and very chill. They cheered on my drunk friends dry humping the jukebox and doing crazy dances.  The bathroom is sadly just 1 single men's and 1 single women's, so the lines can get long sometimes.",

Here are my thoughts though:   Positives +: + Two bars, one with craft beers and another with hard alcohols. They also have daily specials with different drinks each day, and a great happy hour for both food and drinks.  + Games! Lots of board games all over the place for you to lounge and hang out with friends +Dog friendly(?) - I don't know for sure, but there was a dog sitting on a bar stool when we went. So, that's cool.  +Fried mac'n'cheese balls - they were pretty good +Pork belly donut - pretty unique, although it was a bit too greasy for my liking. Very rich in flavor though!   This place is pretty cool, I'd definitely go back for a night of drinking with friends.",

Depending on the amount of people you're with, whether you're eating or not, the variety is pretty cool. If you're in a party mood or more a mellow chill mood, there's a seating area that suits it.  The hubby and I split a burger and pulled pork sandwich. I liked both, and the fries were pretty awesome.  The burger was a little over what we requested, but not enough to send it back.  This seems like a fantastic neighborhood place. Good food, great beer selection as well as full bar, arcade games, a pool table, and they have pub trivia nights and beer events.

Onto the food/drink: they have an indulgent selection of gastropub menu items and some interesting cocktail offerings, too. We ordered the fried mac 'n' cheese bites, the Western burger and the Black Bean Patty burger. \u00a0I'd pass on the mac 'n' cheese bites, they were somewhere in the realm of meh, just tasted liked a breaded version of the Kraft variety. \u00a0Both burgers were quite good, not epic but solid in taste and freshness. \u00a0  The cocktails were so-so; I had the margarita and it was a bit too sweet and syrupy, not enough kick. \u00a0The followup, the Lo Siento, with grapefruit juice + tequila was better but nothing to write home about either.   So if the food and drink was just slightly above average overall, why the 4 stars you ask? \u00a0The bartenders, that's why. \u00a0They were super-friendly and provided great service, even with the chill vibe on a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0  For Missionites, this place is kinda like a spacious Sycamore, both in food quality and atmosphere, and better in service and attitude. \u00a0Worth checking out for sure.",

Everything is spread out, pool table, pinball machines, board games, and a chill side bar area with an eclectic tap selection separate from the main bar and room. I ordered the lamb and fried chicken sliders, side of fries with a random white beer. First off the fries were lightly salted, peppered, and crisped to perfection. I love a good crispy fry. The lamb slider was super juicy and packed with flavor...the fried chicken slider was crispy with accompanying pickled red onions that gave it a good flavor ....makes me want to come back to try the southern fried chicken sandwich. The sliders are tiny but ordering two mix and match sliders with a side of fries was just enough. I could probably eat a dozen sliders in one sitting, each slider takes about 3-4 bites to finish. I would \u00a0suggest the menu have a set price for three mix and match sliders but non the less both were tasty. Did I mention they have pork belly donuts. Say Whaaat?

I came in for my first visit on a Wednesday evening and got a delicious \"Tish\" -fesh tasting peach martini. I then discovered the beer (and shots!) bar in the second room. They have a *very* well selected beer menu, and that's a tall order for someone who works in a brewery. I loved that there was a large table of people playing cards against humanity and the corner location with all windows on two sides gets great afternoon light. The service was prompt and friendly on both sides and \u00a0I'm looking forward to returning and trying some munchies! Extra points for the big jukebox and arcade games, and the fact that almost all the other patrons looked like people I might enjoy chatting with.",

My friend and I got the arugula salad and pulled pork sando, which was THE BEST FRIGGING PULLED PORK SANDO I'VE HAD IN THE CITY. Not a pulled pork connoisseur, but I'd be willing to bet money on it.   Played pool too, which was nice because it is a brand new table. The place was pretty dead at 8:30pm on a Saturday, but I know that won't last. The Willows is well on its way to be as reputable as its sister bar The Sycamore- however this will never happen until they find a bartender who can get people drinks in under 30 minutes.... If my rating were on service alone I'd give it a hard 2 and 1/2 stars, but I have faith that this is just one of those kinks that needs to be worked out over time.   Be back soon!",

Negatives: It's around the corner from my office but we never eat there because the food is WAY overpriced for what you get. $10-$13 burgers that don't come with fries is pretty absolutely terrible. Paying an extra $5.75 for fries and an extra $1.75 for a \"flight of aioli\" is just plain stupid (especially when you don't just offer ranch dressing as an alternative to ketchup). Seriously, a burger and fries/aioli is $20!? I'd much rather go eat at Catheads as it is a much better deal and the food is way superior. $12 for pulled pork, Mac n Cheese, and a beverage. Seating in the back bar is pretty lame. Need more table space to set drinks down on while standing around.",

In any case, this is definitely a strange place. Don't get me wrong - I had a decent time and all. It's just that this place doesn't really have an identity. It's kind of all over the map. On one hand, it's kind of a divey SOMA bar with a pool table. On the other hand, they sell food (burgers, sandwiches, pork belly donuts, etc.). They also have their own craft beer bar in the back, and a small video arcade in the front. This place is literally trying to be everything for everyone.  I ordered a Side Car to kick off my evening. It was tasty/strong - and made with their own special cognac. However, when I tried to order a second one, the bartender informed me that they they \"ran out of the ingredients.\" \u00a0Um... ok. No biggie. I'll have an Old Fashioned then.  In any case, the food is actually decent pub grub. I ordered the fried chicken slider and the lamb slider. Warning: although delicious, the sliders are quite small (even for a slider). So I'd recommend ordering at least 3 or 4 if you're really hungry. The burger looked large and scrumptious. The fried mac and cheese balls with dipping sauce was a winner. And even though they sound weird, the pork belly donuts were actually pretty good.  Service here is definitely spotty. Don't expect a waiter to come to your table (even though they have a full menu). All food orders need to be placed at the bar. It took us about 20 minutes to figure that one out (but that's our own fault). The bartender (who seemed a bit overwhelmed) typed in our order, and we received our food within 20 minutes.   FYI - they do trivia night on Wednesdays at 7pm. There's no cost to play. And the winning team gets $30. Though make sure the other teams aren't cheating. I'm convinced that the team behind us was using their smart phone to look up answers. Oh well.  All in all, this place is decent - not great. If I come back, it will def be for trivia night.",
