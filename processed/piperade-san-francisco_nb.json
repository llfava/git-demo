The calamari appetizer is amazing! The rack of lamb and duck are tasteless. The orange beignets dessert that everyone is raving about is overhype. I much prefer the milk chocolate hazelnut cake! Service is not that great either. Once our server knows we are using Travelzoo voucher he took away the wine menu and said \"Only house wine is included\". What if we hate those house wine and want to order something else and actually pay for it?!?! Parking is relatively easy. There are some street parking in front of the restaurants on Saturday for dinner.   Recommended: No. I am definitely not coming back.",

That of course and the quality of the food, \u00a0and the ambience in music, lighting and comfort supporting the cuisine on the menu.   Our first experience at Piperade one year ago was perfect in every way, even if the professionalism of the waiter could have been a little more generous with an occasional smile and appreciation of our family as his customers. But our experience last evening, New Year's Eve, was lukewarm, and our server though mildly accommodating of my food allergy/sensitivity concerns, was a dud. I can't help but wonder whether my not imbibing in any alcoholic beverages, and therefore our not ordering champagne or a bottle of wine, made our potential check less than he hoped.   The food was delicious, the spirit of the place and fellow diners festive ... but I am doubting we'll choose Piperade again for a romantic dinner for two.",

And the butter lettuce salad, simple, fresh, and tasty. And the stuffed piquillo pepper. J's steak was delicious as well. My cocktail was nothing special, but it wasn't bad, either.

We ordered a bunch of food: beef crudo, mushroom tartlet, dungeness crab with mango, piqullo chilies, roasted cauliflower soup, cornish hen, piperade, and the Friday special black cod, and for dessert we had the meyer lemon roll.  I loved the mushroom tartlet and the cauliflower soup and wasn't that impressed by anything else. \u00a0Oh wait, the meyer lemon roll was actually pretty tasty, I wasn't really expecting much by the time we got there, but it was definitely delicious.  My biggest complaint was the service. \u00a0I sat for more than half of dinner without any water. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0The waiter walked by multiple times and saw my empty water glass and did nothing. \u00a0Additionally, a few times he came and filled everyone else's water glass but mine. \u00a0Really? \u00a0REALLY?!?!  Not ok. \u00a0I don't think I want to come back here, for the money I'm paying I feel like I should at least get some water and not have to ask multiple times for a refill. \u00a0I understand that things are a lot more laid back in Europe. \u00a0I get it, I enjoyed that we got to take some time and enjoy ourselves without being rushed, but I just hated asking for water every time. \u00a0And I wasn't that impressed with the food. \u00a0I'm hoping that March's date night will turn out better than this.",

Chef Gerald Hirigoyen used to own Fringale, and now along with Bocadillos, serves amazing Basque food at the former Pastis. And plenty of parking on the street too! When we arrived, we hung out at the bar while we waited for our table, and a few us had the sublime Chateau L'Hermitage Costieres de Nimes, an off-dry white with a subtle note of honey that I have not been able to find anywhere else. It's become my favorite wine. Among the 8 of us, we had the ham and sheep's milk cheese terrine, the garlic soup with rock shrimp, the braised seafood stew, the rack of pork, the squid with grapes and foie gras, and the gateau basque. I came back in January 2005 when Piperade participated in Dine About Town. I had a perfect meal, with a cute Slovak waiter. The waiters wear jeans here, and that can prove to be a bonus. :) But come for the food, everything else is just extra. Love this place!",

Didn't know what to expect really because I don't know if I've ever had Basque-specific food (thought I've been to restaurants that have dishes from the region). Everything was very tasty!! Had great grilled calamari (though it is rolled in a somewhat lemon juice/sauce, so if you're sensitive to lemon... and a really good albacore (?) spread for appetizers. I got the duck confit while mom got the rack of lamb. Both were cooked to perfection and served with some pretty tasty sides (lentils for me, veggies for her). We also got a side of summer vegetables which was surprisingly expensive ($10) but was actually a huge portion and very good, so that was fine.   Dessert was Gateaux Basque (basically a million layer cake-- whatever I don't remember the french term for it huckleberries) and an apple tart. Apple tart had caramel sauce (which is awesome for those of us who are not pro-chocolate) and was served warm. Noms.   Good atmosphere, seems like it could be good for a (small) family dinner or a fancier date night. Without the coupon would probably be about",

I've learned that when a restaurant has an item on the menu that shares a name with the restaurant you're supposed to have that.  And so it was.  Piperade is a pretty simple concept.

My girlfriend felt the peppers were unnecessary though.  The calamari: it's 8 or 9 bucks, and you get about 8 pieces of calamari. At first i thought \"Jip!\" and then i tried some. I wouldn't be surprised if they cooked just those 8 pieces by themselves with full attention. Not only were they the most unique tasting calamari I had ever had, but it was obvious they had had plenty of attention and effort put into them. Mmmm, tentacles.  I tried some of the Garlic Soup, which my girlfriend and I are still trying to think about how they pulled it off; The lamb chops, really nice and tender and with a smooth sauce that tops the whole thing off; and something who's name escapes me that seemed like a Basque version of cioppino that I really kind of wished that i had ordered.  It's all about taste here, not portions, but at the same time the portions are actually not bad at all. You'll walk away full but not bloated. One of my favorite places.",

This year we chose to go to Piperade the day after Valentine's. It was scrumptious. It was lovely. We'll go again.  It's located in an interesting space on Battery street, and although we sat inside there was a lovely little patio space outside that would be ideal if the weather in SF was cooperative, or if you are bravely bundled (they have patio heaters!) The interior is dimly \u00a0but artfully, lit and has the perfect mixture of exposed urban brick and reclaimed wood floor that says \"I'm having a laid back yet swanky dining experience tonight\".  I started out the evening with the Biarritz cocktail, it's mixture of Jasmine infused vodka, citrus, and a little sugar was refreshing without being cloying.  Since we were little piglets and literally everything on the menu sounded tasty we opted for two starters and an ala carte main course. Mr. H started with the Calamari. It was perfection with it's light dousing of vinaigrette and almonds. I got the open faced mushroom pie. scrumptious. Then came Mr. H's garlic soup and for me, the goat cheese and ham terrine. The soup looked almost like a Chinese egg drop soup when it arrived, a slightly clearish broth with recognizable egg and shrimp. But the taste was utterly unlike eggdrop, \u00a0deep and redolent of roasted garlic. My terrine was one of the clear winners of the evening. You know how when you were a kid and your mom made the most perfect grilled cheese sandwich in the world and the most perfect part of that perfect sandwich was the small, lacy rim of crispy cheese that had melted and oozed out of its bready home onto the griddle and cooked itself to golden perfection? Well this terrine is a 3\" by 3\" by 1/2\" piece of that married to smoky ham and kissed with a little sherry. By that time I'd moved on to a glass of Tannat and it was perfect with the cheesy goodness, and later with the sweetbreads I ordered. The generous portion was lovingly cooked and tender in it's madeira braise with some carrot and spinach. Mr. H had the Sea Bass which was tasty, tender and juicy. We finished up with a piece of Gateau Basque (it only seemed right!) and apple tart. Both were good, although the Basque and it's side of glacied cherries were the winner for me. I'll definitely be back for the chilled mussel and bread salad and the orange blossom beignets. For a dining experience of that caliber we expected to spend somewhat more than we actually did, so we were more than pleased all around.",

Instead, he suggested Piperade. Apparently this is a Basque restaurant. There only four things I vaguely know about the 'Basque' is that its an area that straddles France and Spain, there is a separatist movement including a militant faction, the roots of the Basque language predate Western Europe, and they were historically renown as cod fishermen. I know nothing about the food.  I had the house sandwich, which is good and bad. It was good because it was something easily recognizable, but it was bad because it still gave me no idea about Basque food. The house sandwich, known as Mister Williams, is a panko encrusted chicken cutlet served with thinly sliced avocado, Manchego cheese, and a roasted red pepper.   I'm pretty sure 'Mister Williams' is not a Basque name, but Hell, it was a damn fine sandwich anyways.  Pro-tip: There is a backdoor take-out if you don't have time to sit down.",

Several dishes were very good, notably the sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine. My friends loved the lamb chops and stews, though I can't speak for them personally. There were a few mediocre dishes: my grilled swordfish was boring with little flavor, and the artisanal cheeses were nothing special.

The room's interior was appealing - lots of wood and brick - and the low ceiling had subtle sound-deadening materials that enhanced conversation at the table. After a few minutes wait, we were quickly seated and attended to by a pleasant waitress.  Appetizer: a selection of four cheeses, with two of them having Spanish origins. However, the best were the creamy French-styled brie and the mild blue from Oregon.  Main course: lamb chop, lamb sausage with grilled fennel and roasted new potatoes. Lamb chop was quite good, but nothing spectacular; the accompanying sausage contained paprika and other spices, but tasted more like mutton than lamb; fennel was a nice side, as were the small new potatoes.  Beer: instead of wine I chose a Stella Artois draft beer, for a change, and enjoyed this pilsener.  Service: good throughout the evening.  Parking: plentiful street parking available, as the commercial area is largely deserted at night.

Piquillo Peppers Stuffed with Goat Cheese - It is not spicy, but it has a strong and rich goat cheese taste to back it up. It is quite heavy that I do not recommend finishing this dish by yourself.  Cold Poached Fois Gras - This is as rich as the piquillo peppers with goat cheese, if not heavier, and it is smooth like butter. It's great dish, but not a must-eat.  Fried cheese - This is an awesome dish and surprises my taste bud. \u00a0A recommendation from me!  Piperade with Sauteed Serrano Ham and Poached Egg - It is not up to my expectation partly because I heard how amazing Serrano ham is. \u00a0Made with fresh ingredients, but it's not on top of my list.  Lamb Chop and Sausages - I have a more favorable memory on this dish than the Piperade because I am a fan of lamb.

Had to take some friends from out of town out last night, and since they are right by my office, why not? Rainy Monday night, friend with in-laws in tow... seemed like a great idea.   Food was ok, no one said anything bad about the food, but then again no one said anything great about it either. I personally have had much better duck (NOPA, but be warned, they will skew your duck experience forever).   The real kicker was when it came to paying for our food - and we divvied up the bill and I was signing for my share - our lovely waiter noticed I hadn't included a tip. As I was about to sign my copy, he loudly proclaims (while tapping my check with his finger) \"Service is NOT included\".   Now, I know its not easy being a waiter, but doing something like that, totally uncalled for. Especially since I then had to explain to him that someone else was leaving the tip for the whole table on his check.   Mortified. Definitely not coming back. Never been treated so poorly at any restaurant in my life.",

Everyone at our table had a bite and commented it was \"really good\".   The bread basket of slices of bread came with olive oil and was OK. \u00a0We started off with some appetizers. Raw beef slices were topped with tiny potato chips and was quite good. My mushroom tart was OK. Full of slivers of mushrooms but I probably wouldn't order again.  The meat was tender. 2 of us had the beef cheeks and 2 tried the rack of lamb. \u00a0Hubby likes rack of lamb no matter who makes it. The meat was tender.  The beef cheeks had a robust beefy flavor, as if it was marinated in beef demi-glace'.   The drinks were strong and pretty good. The desserts didn't impress me much. \u00a0I tried the orange blossom beignets, you can taste the orange blossom flavor filling. \u00a0I took 2 of the round beignets home and Jr. Yelpers said it just tasted like a fried oily ball. \u00a0BFF had this dessert which looked like a panna cotta. \u00a0It was on the bland side. \u00a0  We saw the chef come out to talk to customers at a couple of tables. \u00a0Wait staff was good, the bus boy seemed a bit rush and at one point I was afraid our water glasses would never get filled but the lady who seated us, came over with the water pitcher to fill our glasses. \u00a0That's good team work far as I'm concerned.  The great thing about this place is that there was a ton of parking spaces on the street.",

I'll begin with the food. \u00a0It was okay. \u00a0The asparagus salad was tasty, but the flan's consistency was too crumbly and the flavor too sharp for the smoothness of the dressing. \u00a0My halibut was fine, but not stellar. \u00a0The potatoes gratin were PHENOMENAL. \u00a0This was the very best item on the table. \u00a0(Hence the 1 star.)  Now I'll write about the service. \u00a0It was BY FAR the WORST SERVICE I have ever experienced in my life. \u00a0The waiter took 30 minutes to take our order. \u00a0He never asked if we wanted wine. \u00a0(An obvious up sell that he could have benefited from.) \u00a0There was a dirty wine bottle from the previous guests right next to one of my dining companions. \u00a0It remained there for the entire meal. \u00a0After the food was LITERALLY DROPPED in front of us, we ate. \u00a0Most of us felt the food was, \"eh\". \u00a0  After we were finished with our entrees, the dirty dishes and EMPTY water glasses sat for about 20 minutes. \u00a0(Our water glasses were NEVER refilled.)  Our waiter finally DROPPED a few dessert menus. \u00a0We were all so frustrated by our experience thus far that we were praying for a delicious dessert to sweeten a pretty bad experience. \u00a0 Unfortunately, it took our waiter 20 more minutes to ask what we wanted for dessert. \u00a0(Still with empty water glasses and dirty cocktail glasses.) \u00a0We took a pass on dessert completely.  One of my dining companions needed to use the restroom... \u00a0It was completely FILTHY. \u00a0There was actually wet vomit sitting in and around the toilet.  We left a 10% tip. \u00a0I've never done that before.  I doubt I will ever try Piperade again. \u00a0It's a shame. \u00a0They lost several real \"foodies\".",

I will say we got a *good* deal, as in we paid $69 for the Travelzoo voucher and food alone regular price would have been $114 (plus 2 glasses of champagne with the deal). Then again, they add tax + 18% mandatory tip on top of that, so you end up paying way more than intended.   Great rustic atmosphere with outdoor seating area, although it's definitely an older crowd, potentially because it's in a back alley/warehousey section of North Beach. No problem getting an online reservation for a Thursday night, and we were seated right away. We were pretty close to the 2 tables beside us, like when we stopped talking we could hear every word of both their conversations. Not quite ideal. Our server definitely took her time getting to our table, and was rushed, rude, and inattentive the entire night. We heard her say to the couple beside us how completely swamped she was (\"sigh\"), and how she had too many tables, but honestly she just seemed to hate her job. We actually had to ask for ice for our water, and I had to request salt &amp; pepper shakers from the bus boy. I guess I get the whole European authenticity thing, but we're in America here ...  They were out of the cheese plate, which I was most excited about ordering, and so we ended up with the serrano ham and crab txangurro appetizers, which admittedly were both excellent. I had the halibut entree which was tasty, but my bf's steak was way overcooked when he had specified medium rare. The spectacular desserts would have partially made up for the poor service, if only our waitress hadn't forgotten to bring us our leftovers after we asked her to bag them. (????!!) I swear, expensive underwhelming restaurant experiences like this make me thankful for Thai food and pizza.",

We came here by default because it was the only place that could accommodate a party of 6 on short notice on a Saturday night. \u00a0We had 2 appetizers: the cold mussels with bread salad was okay, but the \"bread\" was just straight up CROUTONS. The open mushroom pie though, was AMAZING. This was the best piece of food of the entire night.  The entrees were nothing but disappointment. I ordered the lamb. It was decent, but the rack I had at Chouchou less than a month ago was way better. Also, it was way more overcooked than the medium rare that I had ordered. In fact, I'm sure the lamb that went to the other person at our table was medium rare when she had ordered medium. Umm.. when the waiter brought the food, didn't I ask, \"Is this the medium rare?\" As for the other entrees.. well.. I have nothing good to say. The sea bass was very overcooked and bland. The sauce/toppings that came with the chicken was good, but one of the chickens at our table was so undercooked that it was raw in the center. Shouldn't a chef know how long to cook a chicken breast? And the pommes frites we got on the side were simply store-bought frozen fries. Yea... totally not worth it.  Service was not good, either. My water glass was empty for most of the meal and no one came back to check on us, even when my friend was waiting for someone to come by to take back the raw chicken. Horrible.  I guess we weren't the only ones who were dissatisfied, because the couple at the table next to us just walked out of the restaurant since their food never came out.  Nope, not going back there again.",

ENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: THREE STARS (* * *) The restaurant is beautiful and the chandelier made of bottles was rustic without being too kitschy. \u00a0The noise level was perfect for a business dinner or date, and overall the experience struck the perfect balance between romance/formal and relaxed/casual. \u00a0The bathroom was adequate for a restaurant of this caliber. \u00a0I found the service to be generally good and consistent, but it did sometimes border on pretentious--one instance of requesting a few extra spoons for the appetizers was met with \"you have spoons on your table.\" \u00a0Tsk tsk.  VALUE: TWO STARS (* * *) I found it to be overpriced, certainly for the entrees (ranging from about $17 to the steak at $30), considering the portion sizes. \u00a0The appetizers were also slightly expensive given their sizes and lack of culinary sophistication (butter lettuce salad, anyone?). \u00a0Their prices ranged from $8 to $16. \u00a0All desserts were $8, and well worth it, given their taste and presentation.  Average of FOOD: THREE STARS ENVIRONMENT/SERVICE: THREE STARS VALUE: THREE STARS ================ AVERAGED GRAND TOTAL: THREE STARS  Would I recommend it to others? No. \u00a0For the money, I feel you can certainly get better food elsewhere in the city. \u00a0If you need an easy client dinner spot and this is close by, go for it, you won't be disappointed, but you will not \"thrill the pants\" off of anyone, either.

These are really good.  Seasonal Mushroom Tart-let - Light flaky pastry, nice selection of mushroom types, great taste. Fungus heaven.   Pacific Snapper Spinach and fried garlic vinaigrette.

Food 5 stars Service 3 stars  For example, we had to ask for water about 3 times despite the waitress walking past us on many occasions. We even saw her hanging out at the bar talking to other staff rather than pay attention to the tables.   Perhaps if we had had a different waiter it may have been different but you've got to blame the management for either poor training or attention.   In a lesser restaurant it wouldn't have mattered but Piperade is not cheap and I would expect better. The problem it's things like this that make you think twice about coming back!",

The Basque tapas here are quite interesting and different, definitely not my usual meal. I've tried the appetizers calamari (not fried! grilled in a lemony sauce), piquillo peppers with goat cheese, and the dungeness crab. Entrees I tried were the sole with fried garlic and spinach and the braised seafood and shellfish stew. My favorite out of everything was the sole. The meat was really buttery and soft and the fried garlic and spinach complemented the fish well. Everything else was average. I had the orange blossom beignets for dessert which were great. I liked the unique subtle hints of orange in a thinly fried donut. Great service, really sweet server who accommodated us despite us being the last party there on a Monday night.",

My large plate was the chicken which was extremely flavorful, but the down point was that it was a bit overcooked and dry. My friend did get the piperade which was really good too. i'd recommend it. Lastly i had the lemon curd for dessert. It was good, but they should work on the name. right? curd just doesnt seem appetizing. But i digress. i say its a place to AT LEAST try once.

    "review_text": "Amazing service, great upscale charming atmosphere, very good food!  Crab Salad- a large tower of lightly dressed fresh dungeness crab salad- diced apples, cucumbers and red peppers. Light and refreshing, full of flavor, so glad they didn't drown the delicate crab in dressing.  Mussel Salad: Simple mussels (de-shelled) with frisee and a light vinaigrette, some mini croutons. Good but not mind-blowing.   Rock Cod with Spinach: A fillet of rock cod with a little red vinegar sauce on a bed of sauteed spinach, vinegar...a lil too acidic, too much vinegar. Rock cod was cooked well though.  Sea Bass, Vanilla Brown Butter Foam?, Brussel Sprouts, Pancetta: Sea bass was cooked perfectly, brussel sprouts were full of flavor and pancetta added nice bite. Maybe a little too much vanilla in the foam/sauce but overall pretty good dish.  Duck Breast, Potatoes: Nice sweet and savory sauce, duck was tender, potatoes simple but flavorful. Very good overall, would have preferred slightly more rare duck but that's just my preference.  Lamb Chop: Perfectly cooked, juicy.   Their desserts were REALLY GOOD, definitely not an afterthought!  Flan: delicious!! Best flan I've ever had...I'm not a huge flan fan and this one blew me away, it was creamy and had a wonderful caramelized sauce.  Almond Cake- dense, full of almond flavor and a little liquor maybe? Super yummy.  Chocolate Cake- rich, dense, fudgy, with a yummy cream on top that tasted more complex than a plain whipped cream..perhaps some marscarpone or creme fraiche.  Orange Blossom Beignets: Though they are known for these, I thought they tasted too perfumey, like when you spray your floral perfume and then accidentally get some of the mist in your mouth :( The texture was good, just too floral.  Cheese Course- yummy fig cake, cheeses were all very good especially the manchego.  There service is awesome, very attentive, quick and friendly, and not uptight.   The ambiance is wonderful: charming and elegant...something about this place just feels happy and comfortable, and even though it's an upscale dining establishment it doesn't feel stuffy at all. The lighting is bright and cheery and there's a celebratory ambiance. Great for a special occasion.",

Parking was easy, there was ample street parking and the restaurant was busy for a Saturday night. It's a cosy little restaurant. The staff was prompt and welcoming, we were seated right away.   The wine list is pretty impressive, from the finest Basque wines to wines from France, Spain and then, our very own California wines. We got served with some fresh bread and delicious olive oil to compliment our wine/bubbles.  We had a bunch of appetizers, and here is what I would recommend:  \u00a0 \u00a0- Dungeness Crab \"Txangurro,\" Mango, Peppers, Basil : Served cold and absolutely incredible in flavor. I was enjoying the chunks of mango and pepper.   \u00a0 - Piquillo Peppers, Goat Cheese, Pistachios, Golden Raisins : Being not such a big fan of cheese, in general, I'm skeptical trying it. But this was a perfect 10 for me, absolutely delicious and the texture was firm yet smooth. I happily went for a round two.  What I didn't enjoy was the Cold Poached Foie Gras, Sea Salt, Black Pepper, Fruit Compote, it was my first experience with Cold Poached Foie Gras and the after taste it left me with, didn't make me happy. People in the party seemed to enjoy it but it did make me loose my appetite for a few.   I had the Black Cod, Broccolini, Baby Leeks, Pil-pil Aioli. An absolutely well done, well presented and delectable item. Cod was mild and tender, the portion is small. I did sample some Lamp chops and NY steak, but the tenderness of the Cod beats all the other sampling I indulged in that night.  Out of the desserts, what stands out was, The Dark Chocolate Cake \"Amatxi\" &amp; Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche.

I've been to the Basque country and the \u00a0restaurant should be called 'Barely Basque'.  Sure, the presentation was lovely (1/2 star), but \u00a0the appetizers and entrees were bland bland bland. What it lacked in actual taste was made up in the salt used in the dishes. The garlic soup tasted more like salt water to gargle with--totally lacked flavor.   Another 1/2 star for the rustic decor.  I am giving it an additional star because the gateau Basque was actually good. Minus a star because the beignets were cold and should have been at least warm.  I was pretty disappointed with the whole experience. It used to be a fairly decent restaurant with authentic Basque dishes.   The restaurant is definitely over-hyped.",

    "review_text": "The first time I went to Piperade a year or so ago, I had a lovely dining experience. \u00a0Service, ambience and the food were great. \u00a0So when I recommended it for a work dinner for 8 of us, I expected more of the same. \u00a0Sadly, I was wrong.  The food as always, was terrific. \u00a0Every dish we ate was delicious and cooked exactly as we would have liked it.  The glaring issue this time was service. Our server was downright useless and felt like a banquet waiter serving 100 people in a Las Vegas hotel ballroom. \u00a0He took a half hour to first come to our table and subsequent visits were rushed, perfunctory and entirely reactive. \u00a0Not once did he make suggestions on menu items, offer to pour our wine or even ask us if we wanted anything. \u00a0We'd have to flag him down, order and/or ask for additional items including water and wine and then wait another half hour for him to show up again. \u00a0Between orders, we'd get our dishes nearly thrown down on our tables by expeditors and buss boys. \u00a0Our waiter would come by a couple of times to ask \"are you enjoying\" and then quickly disappear. \u00a0Because of his constant absence, our dinner took nearly 3 hours from start to finish, which would have been ok were we having fun instead of waiting for long periods between courses and for wine and water. \u00a0In his defense, his long absences were clearly because he was working multiple large tables including a party of 12 next to us. \u00a0That said, no one from management once came over to pick up the slack. The celebrity chef/owner of Piperade was doing his rounds around the restaurant, saying hello to patrons and kissing regular guests on the cheek.... perhaps he and his staff should have picked up the slack and covered for frazzled waiters instead of doing his celebrity round.  The icing on the cake was when our bill came with 18% \"suggested\" gratuity included. \u00a0One of my biggest gripes about our dining culture is this pervasive need to over tip and for entitled wait staff to expect 20% or more in tips for lackluster and sometimes downright bad service. \u00a0Tips should be considered a gift for good service, not expected for a terrible one. \u00a0Our hosts stayed back after the rest of us left to have a talk with our clueless waiter about his misguided expectations. \u00a0I wonder how that transpired.  In any case, back to what i said in the beginning.... the food was excellent and all things equal, I'd go back in a heart beat. \u00a0Sadly, the terrible service from last night's dinner shocked the entire group and unfortunately, terrible service overshadows good food. \u00a0In a city with a plethora of great dining venues, what sets restaurants apart is service. \u00a0In that aspect, Piperade fails miserably. \u00a0I don't envision going back anytime soon.",

She knows nothing about any of the menu items if you ask her and she is just plain stupid and unfriendly. Sorry to be so harsh but this is a daily occurrence and I see others EVERY DAY storming off with their orders.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to ring up orders and hand people food but this just not seem to be getting any better and it has been months now since she has been there.

For appetizers we got the following: Warm piquillo peppers with goat cheese, California raisins and moscatel vinaigrette -The goat cheese was warm, creamy and the proper degree of tangy; the raisins added a hint of sweetness that complemented the cheese and the pepper was the perfect envelope to pull all the flavors together Dungeness crab salad \"tangurro\" with apple, curry, and piment d'Espelette -It didn't hurt that it was dungeness crab season - this was the best crab salad I've had - it did not smell like fish at all, was creamy (which usually a gross consistency to have with fish, in my opinion), and had whole, nice big chunks of crab. Chilled mussel and bread salad with red wine vinagrette -Not usually a fan of mussels, but these mussels were big, full of flavor (like an ocean in your mouth) and the bread salad complemented the texture of the mussel. Thinly sliced Serrano ham -The ham was wonderful, thinly sliced, airy pieces of meat that melted in your mouth (it also was excellent with any leftover goat cheese from the first appetizer).  For lunch I had the Steamed Pacific Snapper with Fried Garlic Vinaigrette. \u00a0The snapper was perfect - flaky and again, no fishy smell. \u00a0The slices of garlic were perfectly pan fried and echoed of Goodfellas. \u00a0The meal was on a dish of spinach that even a child would eat - delicious, eloquently sauteed with a hint of garlic.  The service was excellent - all the wait staff was easy to talk to, ask questions, very quick on asking if you needed anything. \u00a0For lack of a better word, they were well \"trained.\"  Regarding prices, I'm not really sure, since it was a business lunch, it looked a bit pricey, but there are affordable entrees on the menu for under $15 and all the appetizers are around $7. \u00a0This is only for lunch, not sure how dinner works, but I definitnely recommend Piperade for an elegant lunch, if you feel like treating yourself, or if you need to entertain a client.",

Of course, if the food was good, I wouldn't complain, but it really didn't deliver; I was truly hoping that Piperade would have amazing food with all the decorative hype.   The service was cordial and the restaurant is quite nice. A bit on the fancy side, which is perfect for a business luncheon when the food is only secondary to the conversational transaction.   I do like the originality of the Piquillo peppers. It's stuffed with goat cheese with pistachios and golden raisins on the side. For an appetizer, it's delicious! The goat cheese was slightly warmed and melted inside the peppers, and the sweet taste of the raisins added a nice touch to lighten the flavor. Piquillo peppers: 5/5!  The tuna sandwich I ordered turned out cold and dry, so I don't recommend it. It's actually a real tuna sandwich, where a thick piece of tuna fish is stuck in the middle of two pieces of bread. The tuna was seared well, such that the middle was still half raw, like how one would cook medium-well steak... but it came out cold! Also, because the tuna was so healthy, it lacked any flavor to help take down the bread. I was so disappointed, that I actually wished I had a normal tuna sandwich. At that point I didn't mind having just pieces of tuna marinated in mayo...I just wanted SOMETHING that had SOME flavor! I think the dish would have been better if the tuna wasn't in a sandwich form. Tuna sandwich= 2/5.",

Perfection.  - Calamari \"a la plancha\": I'm not even a calamari fan and I liked this dish. \u00a0Not breaded and deep fried like the abominations they have everywhere else. \u00a0You can really taste the quality of the squid here.  - Marinated mussel salad: Excellent taste to this dish. Especially for seafood lovers.  - Wild mushroom tart: Delicious mix of umami here - all on top of the most buttery, rich crust you'll ever taste.  - Almond and pear tartlet with creme fraiche: The perfect amount of sweetness, with a slightly tart whipped topping. \u00a0After a spectacular meal, I just couldn't believe the desserts matched up.  Just a skoach from the top:  - Fresh goat's milk cheese and ham terrine: Delicious, rich dish.  - Butter lettuce salad: A little plain compared to the other stunners on the menu, but a nice start with the perfect, crisp acidity.  - Cold poached foie gras with pepper, sea salt and pineapple and vanilla compote: Really nice foie - I just couldn't get down with the vanilla scented fruit.  - Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese: I liked it, but it wasn't anything outstanding.  - Artisanal cheese plate: You all know how much I love cheese, but it's pretty much the same anywhere you go.  - Duck confit: Not a big fan of duck (except the extra crispy, extra fatty kind) so I'm of no help here.  Gateau basque: What a way to end a meal.  - Chocolate cake \"amatxi\" with creme fraiche: \u00a0So dark and decadent. \u00a0And there's that creme fraiche again...  There were seriously no dishes that I didn't enjoy here. \u00a0I'm truly impressed with Piperade. \u00a0It's the perfect spot to take your foodie friends that like to share. \u00a0I'll definitely be back to finish off the big plates!",

The restaurant is lovely and the staff is attentive and courteous but I found both my appetizer and my entree under seasoned and lacking in depth of flavor. I started with the garlic soup which I had expected to be more creamy but was actually somewhat similar to the egg drop soup you get at Chinese restaurants. It had some bland rock shrimp in it and really the overwhelming taste was salty. I could see what they were going for in the soup though and it was disappointing to me that it didn't quite come together. For my entree I had the piperade which was also good but was hampered by the fact that it was served to me way too hot and again the overwhelming flavor profile was salt. I didn't taste enough of the vegetables and it felt like they had not been allowed to cook enough to develop the flavors and let them meld together into something wonderful. I'm really bummed about my less than stellar experience but am willing to give Piperade another shot.",

Our waiter was excellent and the consumate professional. \u00a0He is from France, and he was very knowledgable about the menu. \u00a0He helped us choose the first course and the wine, which were all excellent:  Hericot Verts -- had a surprising hint of mint. \u00a0Delish! Calamari -- perfectly cooked squid with a perfect almond tomato sauce. Stuffed Peppers -- great blend of flavors with the cheese inside. Tomato Tart -- Wow!!! \u00a0The cherry tomatoes were very sweet.  The second course was also very good. \u00a0I enjoyed the seafood stew, and my brother in law had the lamb, which was perfectly cookedl. \u00a0The ladies had the piperade (described by our waiter as ratatoulle without the eggplant) and the halibut.  The best part was the dessert. \u00a0The begneits were just as good as other Yelpers have described. \u00a0I also really enjoyed the the apple tart with a dark carmelized sugar drizzle.

I ordered the goat cheese appetiser, which was decidedly small for restaurants in this country. For my entree, I ordered the sea bass, for dessert the chocolate cake, and a glass of Tempranillo. The latter, I thoroughly enjoyed.  Per the service, the waiter, Daniel, came by asking me if I was done twice unnecessarily and failed to come by when I'd cleaned my plate. Odd that, I would think that an empty plate would \u00a0serve as a signal to the waiter to come by and offer, well, something -- the cheque perheps?

Everyone's food was delicious and nicely presented. I'll start from the beginning. :)  Bread - huge basket full of sliced sourdough (?) bread. The olive oil was full of flavor and really robust. I think I ate 4 slices and sopped up at least 2 TBS of olive oil.  Garlic soup - had very high expectations, as everyone was raving about this soup. It smelled garlicky, but didn't actually taste garlicky. I liked the bits of bacon in it, and thought the shrimp and egg bits were delicious. In itself though, I thought it tasted like wonton soup. Almost all the girls who ordered this put in pepper to taste. Pretty filling though, and still good. Shouldn't have been that hyped though!  Roasted pork - YUM. The meat is quite tender. At first bite though, I did think it was slightly dry. but then I ate another bite with the cabbage, and WOW. My mouth was in heaven. The pickled cabbage was perfectly sweet/sour, and complimented the pork very well. I finished everything. I want more now...  Orange blossom beignets - a very unique spin on beignets! The aroma of orange blossom really came through, but didn't overwhelm the taste buds. I didn't feel like I was eating perfume, so that was an A+. It was quite a delightful treat.  Chocolate cake \"amatxi\" - delicious. Great flavor and consistency. Reminded me of the insides of a slightly overcooked molten lava cake...so still dense and moist, but not runny. The creme fraiche that accompanied it paired very well with the rich chocolate cake. The cake disappeared within 4 mins. I got to eat the last bite. i win! :)",

    "review_text": "Not a bad dinner but nothing special either. We started with the piquillo peppers stufffed with goat cheese and golden raisins. The sweetness of the raisins went quite well with the goat cheese and the peppers. I had the lamb basquaise chop/shoulder/loin and my dining partner had the piperade. The lamb shoulder and chop were quite good. The loin was a little raw even for my taste but tender nonetheless. The presentation really wasn't much to write home about and it was pretty much all meat on the plate except for a few beans. My friend's piperade looked pretty weird and it wasn't much of a presentation either.  We had a very nice 2005 Bodegas Verdutuev Volver Tempranillo for around $40. Given that it's a $12 wine on the street that's quite the markup.  Deserts were quite good. We tried the Gateau basque and the and the chocolate cake.  Service was efficient but a little gruff and impersonal. Some confusion about who was our waiter was also a little weird.  So like I said, not a bad experience but for almost $150 for 2 (including tip, tax, a bottle of wine, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 dessert) definitely felt overpriced and not worth the trouble. Really no reason to go back.",

    "review_text": "Love the ambiance of this restaurant, but I've always been a bit unsure about it. The food is usually quite nice, but there's just something,,,not right. Last night I figured out what it is.  Went in with a TravelZoo voucher for the 2 glasses of sparkling wine, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 dessert menu ($79). Not a bad deal. Were were seated right away, the waiter came over, took the voucher and immediately returned with the wine. If he had waited to talk to us, I would have said, bring one now and one later (for my SO), since I didn't plan on having the sparkling wine at all. The waiter seemed somewhat distracted when he took our order. Perhaps he wanted a different set of diners.  Food was excellent, though. I had the smoked herring salad, husband had the cheese plate; I had the lamb rack (done perfectly), husband the seafood stew (served somewhat cool). We would have asked for a warmer stew IF THE WAITER HAD STOPPED TO ASK US HOW ANYTHING WAS. But he didn't. We were seated in a spot where he had to pass us constantly and he seemed purposely not to look at us.  We had to flag someone down to ask for pepper and more water. Who has to ask for water in a restaurant of this caliber? \u00a0  During the meal, the bus boy would stop by and remove something from the table that needed removing, but not everything. We spent the meal looking at 2 olive oil dispensers (why 2? I surely don't know) and dirty wine glasses and flutes. But the waiter NEVER returned to the table. Except to throw, and I do mean throw, down the dessert menus.  My orange blossom honey beignets were outstanding and hubby enjoyed his apple tart. Time for the check. Where did our waiter go? Hmmmm. He finally did drop, and I do mean drop, the bill on the table on one of his fly bys. No smile. No thanks. No looking directly at us.  Unfortunately the Travelzoo voucher requires an 18% tip, otherwise we would have made an adjustment.  So, what I figured out about Piperade is that they concentrate on the food and only the food, but that is not the only reason we go to a restaurant. We like to have a comfortable time in a welcoming environment. It will be a long while before we return to Piperade, if ever. And we live only 3 blocks away.",

The service was very attentive and accomadating - they rearranged our entire table so that we could have more room with 9 people instead of 10!   The food was tasty but a bit overpriced. Among the 10 people of my party, we tried most the main dishes of the menu. For appetizers, the garlic soup and the mushroom pizza tart were the best and most flavorful. The garlic soup wasn't overly garlicy and the mushrooms on the tart were amazing. As for entrees, I had the salmon w/ summer corn. It was pretty straightforward - however the nectarines atop the salmon were a nice surprise. For dessert, the french apple tart w/ caramel was delicious. Small &amp; simple, but a nice close to the meal. Also, the citrus beignets were refreshing and melted in your mouth. They even gave us an extra bowl!  Overall this place was a nice find for a dinner restaurant. The food was simple yet full of flavor. The ambiance was homey and comfortable, not too loud and not too quite.

On days that I'm not too concerned about carbs, I'll get a toasted sesame bagel with cream cheese, tomato, and pesto. Pass on the baked egg whites - the whites are overdone and bland. Frittatas are tastier but heavy, and I've found egg shells more than a few times in mine. Lunch runs around $8+. The chicken mandarin salad ($7.95) is my go-to salad, although I'm usually hungry again by 4pm. I also like the side tuna &amp; black rice salad, but it's so small that I usually get a soup along with it. \u00a0   On rainy days, the lines are ridiculous and you're better off walking in the rain a few blocks away cause you'll get your food faster than the suckers staying in line.

It was the holiday season, and even on a Thursday night, the dining room was jam-packed with people.   My companion and I started the meal off with the garlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon and egg. It had a savory piquency that was quite memorable. A refreshing, zesty beginning to a great meal.  Next came my pick for my favorite dish of the evening, if not the entire year: Salt-cured cod (bacalao) with lemon creme fraiche, oysters and caviar. Words cannot describe the sensory pleasure this dish brought: The thin cod fillets were fork-soft, flavorful and ice-cold, as were the tender, plump little oysters on top (my favorite part of the dish). I still remember biting through one of those little oysters atop a piece of rustic bread, topped with some of the creme fraiche - absolute heaven.  A close second was the cold poached foie gras with membrillo paste. Personally, I much prefer hot foie gras to cold. Foie is so meltingly tender and succulent when served hot, but when cold, all the fats seize up and what was once tender becomes firm. (Sort of like what happens when you cook a chicken, then refrigerate it, allowing all the fat to become solid as a rubber ball). Still, of course the foie tasted lovely smeared on the crusty bread, particularly paired with the very sweet, complex-tasting membrillo paste.   The entree was less unusual, but still delicious: I think it was a rare duck tenderloin, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.   If we had dessert, I can't remember it now; nevertheless, the meal was really one to remember.",

I do think it's expensive definitely, and therefore, I can't go more than once every couple weeks I guess.  I do feel that I have to wait a weirdly long time for my food as it seems to come from the nether-worlds when I order it and the several times I've been there I've inadvertently tried to take someone else's food as it's being handed out the window!

They also had quite a simple menu, but I think a place like this focuses on a few dishes just to make sure they're done right.  I settled on an order of the lamb chops, which I really liked, but a lot of other options seemed very appetizing, such as the chicken, duck, and sea bass. If I had a bit more money, I wouldn't mind coming here more often.  Credit to their staff for getting the food out very quickly for a large group (I noticed this since my dinner last night was ungodly slow) and for being very patient in our inability to get orders out quickly/leave the table quickly. Politeness goes a long way in my book!",

    "review_text": "I had the pleasure of dining at Piperade with a friend recently.  In all, it was just the perfect evening out. The ambiance of the place is chic yet warm, and the aroma that fills the dining room was simply intoxicating. After a glass of txakolina at the bar while waiting for the table to be set, we were seated for a memorable feast.  First was the cold poached foie gras with blue berry compote. It was beautiful in its simplicity: the crisp toast, the lushness of the foie, and the sweet acidity of the compote blended very well.  Then came the soup. It was unpretentiously called chicken, bacon and white beans soup, which is exactly what it was. But the execution!!!! It's not often that I'd just slurp the broth alone: never mind the bits of smoky bacon and perfectly cooked beans, I was in heaven just with the broth.   This is one area where so many restaurants fall short: the quality of the stock. Stock is the foundation , and without a proper foundation, no matter how you engineer the edifice, it will fall down. Here, it's bolted directly to the bedrock.  The main course was duck confit, with lentils. This rustic food with its humble origins deserves loving preparation, and the chef delivers. From the crisp, crusty skin to the melt-in-your-mouth-but-not-falling-apart meat, I was in heaven. It was accompanied by lentils, with more bits of bacon or jamon, pearl onions, and probably a good amount of piment d'espelette that lent distinctive, fruity character. It formed an effective counterpoint . \u00a0In short, enjoying the whole dish was like listening to a J.S.Bach fugue.  Being a fan of aged Spanish wine, I brought my own bottle: good 25 years older than most on the wine list. However, the wine list here is quite extensive, and wines are very carefully chosen to accompany the food without overwhelming the palate. There are some top-shelf stuff like Krug champagne and various vintages of Opus 1, but I found them to be priced very reasonably. I would not hesitate to order any of the wine from their list.  I came away thrilled by the experience. I can't wait to return, and bring more friends to this jewel.",

However, the cream of mushroom herb soup and the garlic soup with ham croutons was excellent! Also highly recommend the mussel salad if you are a mussels fan.

All sandwiches come with a small green salad, which definitely makes the $7-$8 range worth it for me.  Their signature Mr. Williams' fried chicken sandwich is a treat, but it's kind of greasy so I don't have it too often. Same goes for when it's in salad form. I forget where they get their cookies from, but they're giant, delicious, and make me feel like a total fatty. Quite the treat.  The guy at the register seems like a genuinely nice dude. Has started asking me how my day's going. They've recently set up their ordering, paying, and waiting process so it's easier to follow, so even long lines go by rather quickly.",

You won't have difficulty getting what you want when you want it, you'll just get it with a bit of attitude from the snooty waiters and the icy hostess.

I just went there a few weeks ago and was a little upset that my favorite garlic prawns are no longer on the menu. \u00a0However, I did find many new dishes that would take its place. \u00a0 Chef Gerard really knows how to handle seafood. \u00a0You will rarely go wrong with his fish dishes but don't limit yourself to that. \u00a0He REALLY knows how to make an amazing melt in your mouth Daube (aka stew). \u00a0The last time I was there, the lamb chops were perfectly seasoned and perfectly seared and just oooooh... sooooooo... gooooood!  As for the desserts - you cannot go wrong with the apricot and almond tart, cornmeal cake with fruit, and orange blossom beignets (for a great fried kick!).",

The food &amp; the service was excellent. \u00a0We started out splitting the haricots verts with figs &amp; walnuts salad, which was light &amp; refreshing. \u00a0My husband got the halibut while I tried the duck. \u00a0Both were delectable. \u00a0It's really hard to not overcook duck, but my dish was moist &amp; not overpowered by the cherries. \u00a0We wrapped up by splitting the apple tart with vanilla ice cream, which I'm sure is not a traditional Basque dessert. \u00a0If it wouldn't have been completely inappropriate, we would have licked our dishes clean!  Bonus points for splitting the appetizer &amp; dessert for us before they came out (we didn't request it) &amp; for not charging us extra for splitting items. \u00a0Also, we were charged for two appetizers instead of one &amp; our server quickly corrected that as well.  Definitely on my list of restaurants to revisit in the near future!",

Watching porn is strenuous activity. One must consume a proper meal as to not bonk out in mid porno session.  It was a Tuesday night and the crowd was a bit older than I expected. The table next to us was full of lawyers having an \"I can be louder and more pretentious that you can.\" contest. Although annoying, strangely captivating. Maybe my need to eavesdrop is just really that bad. Anyways, our server must've been smokin' crystal or somethin, he would never fully stop when he talked to us he kept trying to take our plates while we still had food on them. He was like the little kid who cant sit still. But he did suggest a nice pinot.  We started with foie gras torchon which was served with pear puree, sea salt and cracked peppercorns. It was ok, but the pear puree was too sweet. Next we had braised oxtail wrapped in cabbage served in broth. \u00a0Pretty slammin'. Dippin the bread in the jus was mmm mmm tasty. First entree halibut with clams in a light broth. This was pretty dope. Fish was light flaky and moist. Broth was light and flavored with clams. Second entree was a lamb extravaganza. There were a couple of very nice cuts from a rack of lamb and a pile of roasted lamb shoulder. Served with a vegetable relish or something like that. It was kinda mixed together. Not gamy at all.  Dessert Apple tart and corncake with creme fraiche. Pretty standard stuff not great, but very good. \u00a0The Macallan neat was a nice finale.  Overall a nice dinner. Pretty costly tho. I'll be back, when i need another break.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful, the food is consistently good, and the staff is wonderful.   I would highly recommend the goat cheese and ham appetizer. It's a great combination of flavors and has an interesting texture -- it's crispy and sort of melty at the same time. My only complaint is that it wasn't large enough.   For entrees, you can't go wrong with the steak or the lamb. I hear the seafood is very good but I'm not much of a fish fan. I went here with a friend one evening who ordered the duck at the waitress' recommendation even though he rarely, if ever, likes duck and he thought it was perfect. The meats here are often cooked just right so it's a great place to try new things.",

I really like the decor of this restaurant, especially on the outside. \u00a0It's intimate with low lighting. \u00a0Basque food is the specialty, and we ordered fried manchego cheese, sauteed green beans, a tomato tart, and chicken with corn and chorizo. \u00a0The fried cheese was good, but it was lacking acidity for me.. It had to be eaten with the pickled vegetables for a more robust flavor. \u00a0The green beans were okay too. \u00a0They had to be eaten with the marinated pluots to compliment the dressing.  The stars of the meal were the tomato tart and the chicken. \u00a0The tart had simple ingredients: cherry tomatoes, a flaky crust, basil, garlic, balsamic, and thyme. \u00a0And together was an explosion of flavor! \u00a0I wish it was bigger because I could've eaten more. \u00a0My friend ordered the chicken, and she devoured it. \u00a0I got to try the corn and the chorizo, which were fantastic.  We weren't thinking of ordering dessert, but we got the menu, so we decided to treat ourselves. \u00a0The orange blossom beignets caught our attention, so we ordered one to share. \u00a0They were okay. \u00a0I'm assume it's not a traditional beignet, but I wish it had more of sweetness to it. \u00a0And it was a little dry to me, but if it was drenched with sauce, it would've been more of a Greek dessert.  There were some hits and misses, but overall it was a good meal with friendly service, and I would definitely come back again for the tomato tart.",

This time again, our reservation was 8:30pm. \u00a0I called them in advance to save the mushroom tartlet if possible.  We walked in the restaurant and the host welcomed us with a very nice smile telling us that they saved the mushroom tartlet for us! \u00a0Delightful! \u00a0  And here is my review for it:  I got so excited to see the plentiful mushrooms when the dish came to our table. Oh my god, it is FANTASTIC!!! \u00a0It is full of flavors with the very flaky piecrust. \u00a0Yes, I would say it is more like a pie. It is the best mushroom pie I have ever had. \u00a0 I forgot to ask them what kind of mushrooms they have in it, but definitely there were King Oyster mushrooms and Maitake mushrooms at least. Definitely it gets 6 stars! \u00a0It is a MUST-TRY! \u00a0  Let me move to other dishes here:  - Warm Sheep's Milk Cheese + Ham Terrine, Aged Sherry = 3.5 stars  I love how crispy it is, but it is too salty for me.   - Rack of lamb, Merguez, Fennel, Cumin Date Relish = 4 stars Lamb is tasty and tender. Sausage is delicious and spicy. Fennel is so sweet.  - Braised Veal Cheeks with Peppers = 4.5 stars Soup has a rich taste of peppers. \u00a0Veal is melting tender.  Overall, I would give them 4.5 stars. Piperade is a wonderful restaurant with a lot of flavorful dishes and pleasant service.  Mmm, mushroom tartlet.... cannot wait to come back.",

Upon arriving, we told our server we were grabbing just a quick, small bite as we had somewhere to be. \u00a0Clearly she didn't understand the \"quick\" part as she didn't return for our drink orders for 10 minutes. \u00a0We ordered the mussels, a sheeps cheese and ham terrine appetizer and sauteed sole to split. \u00a0When we got our first two starters, we were super confused - the mussels were actually a cold salad - and very fishy at that. \u00a0I was sad that our server didn't explain that this was actually different than most traditional mussels - at a place as nice as this, I would expect more guidance. \u00a0Same went for the terrine - you actually couldn't see the cheese, it was extremely light and in between the superfine ham slices...so really was like a salty ham slice with slight crusting of cheese. \u00a0It was good...but again, not at all what I expected and way too salty for me. \u00a0Most disappointing was the fact that our server never came back to check on us to ask us how it was. \u00a0I would have liked to let her know that it would be helpful to know beforehand as I honestly couldn't eat the salad (too fishy) and would have like to know the other options. \u00a0Finally, the sole came, which they split for us and while it was good if I took a bit with all ingredients (garlic and sauteed spinach were divine), the fish itself was, well, fishy. \u00a0Again, since runners brought out our dishes and she never came back until the bill, there was no opportunity for feedback to our server, even when the bill came. \u00a0It should always be a question in any restaurant about the satisfaction of the taste of the food - so needless to say in such a nice place, she soured the experience for me. \u00a0I really want to like this place, but after spending $80 for a meal to my disliking with no question of my satisfaction, I will definitely have to spend my money elsewhere.",

    "review_text": "The precision and attention to detail that are usually Piperade hallmarks were conspicuously missing during my last meal here. \u00a0I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since I've had many an outstanding dinner at Piperade and hopefully last night was just an anomaly (the place was packed and there was a party of 12-14 people so the staff was overtaxed).  We started with the crab, mango, and pepper salad and the cold-poached foie. \u00a0The crab was anemic - severely lacking in flavor and refrigerator cold \u00a0(bland and too finely shredded, making the dish texturally boring), accompanied by precise dices of just-ripe mango and overpowering pickled peppers. \u00a0The foie was of inferior quality and the terrine was haphazardly made, breaking into pieces when cut into. \u00a0The \u00a0vanilla-infused compote was its saving grace.  We then had the duck with sunchokes, onions, and balsamic reduction and the lamb trio (chop, shoulder, and loin). \u00a0The duck was our one unadulterated highlight - beautifully cooked and well-accompanied, very mellow and delicious. \u00a0  But the lamb...oh, where to start. \u00a0The portion was comically oversized, with easily a pound of protein on the plate. \u00a0When I cut into the chop, it was rubbery and grossly overcooked. \u00a0Our server was very attentive and considerate in immediately noticing the problem without my prompting and taking the plate back to the kitchen. \u00a0She returned just a few minutes later with a new chop. \u00a0I wanted to let it rest so the juices got a chance to recirculate and cut into the shoulder to find it dry and below room temperature. \u00a0The loin was likewise lukewarm and completely devoid of any lamb flavor, as was the chop. \u00a0They were accompanied by mushy and bland gigante beans. \u00a0Again, our server really took care of us when I told her it was not to my liking, sending the plate back and removing the charge from the bill, as well as offering another entree free of charge.  I got the seafood stew, with perfectly cooked and delicious clams that had a compelling iodine and brine flavor. \u00a0The remaining fish was a bit overcooked and unremarkable.  Desserts were a marked improvement, we got the beignets and the kefir yogurt with asian pear and honey. \u00a0The beignets were room temperature and doughy but the flavor was good. \u00a0The yogurt, however, was spectacular - tangy and creamy; well accented with the crisp fruit and sweet honey. \u00a0The kitchen could have ramped up the presentation though, as the yogurt was simply ladled onto the plate. \u00a0A simple piping bag would have greatly enhanced the visual appeal of the dish.  I've had too many stellar meals at Piperade to be seriously bothered by this miss-step and will certainly be back, expecting the greatness that I know chef Hirigoyen can deliver.",

Despite the post-modern architecture, the staff kindly found us a four-top which assisted her parents in hearing everyone.   Honestly, my only concern with the entire meal was finding a wine to pair well with the diverse flavors represented in our orders. What a great problem to have! Piperade's tone was convivial, though not exuberant. As proof: every party, seated at tables or at the bar, was smiling and laughing. I've never seen such a large group of random restaurant patrons, on a Monday night no less, in such a pleasant mood.  Returning to this restaurant will be a pleasure, and likely another excellent experience, thanks to the superior execution in so many facets.   BTW, parking nearby at night isn't too difficult.

    "review_text": "55% Pretty good Basque.  ***Short Review  Came here for dinner with a small group of four in Sep '11  Although I tried their prix fixe, some of my dining companions ordered of the 'a la carte' menu, so I got to try more dishes. My prix fix included a butter lettuce salad, veal &amp; red pepper stew, and an orange beignet dessert, all for around $38-ish.  Food here is fairly hit &amp; miss, but the experience wasn't bad overall. \u00a0 Dishes rate from pretty good (although not quite great), to mediocre. The 'Roasted Lamb' was probably the best dish we had. I also enjoyed their roasted their Piquillo peppers. Their 'Bacao' of raw cod &amp; oysters over creme fraiche is a bit of an acquired taste, and probably too briny for some. Avoid their NY Steak, the quality is comparable to what you'd might expect at Sizzler.  I feel that the prix fixe presents the best value. Other menu items are reasonably priced. Portion sizes are reasonable.  Ambiance is a pleasant, rustic and comfortable. Service was personable and more attentive than average.  Detailed review will go into the dishes with further info. I'll also add some thoughts about the general experience.  ****Detailed Review  Cooking style here I feel is not really that different from Spanish, although it refers to itself as Basque. \u00a0Although you are not having tapas, the flavors aren't too different. \u00a0The preparation here isn't complex, and the approach in cooking is relatively conservative. \u00a0The quality of ingredients can be hit &amp; miss. \u00a0While I enjoyed their veggies and lamb, I felt their NY steak was unforgivably poor. \u00a0Ordering the right dishes here, or at least one that fits your preference will make a considerable difference. \u00a0  On to the food;  -'Butter Lettuce + Fresh Herb Salad' ($10 or part of prix fixe) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=lYW2-NnVpPFjTheytHdD9w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5V\u2026</a>  I had this as part of my prix fixe. \u00a0Salad itself is quite fresh, and a generous portion is offered. \u00a0I like butter lettuce, because I feel (as the name implies) it has a more buttery texture and it one of my favorite greens. \u00a0Ultimately it wasn't a bad dish, but the use of the herb (I'm guessing vinaigrette) dressing really didn't add much to the greens. \u00a0I don't think there would be much difference if they served the greens as is. \u00a0Dish rating, 45% (two and a half stars).  -Haricots Vert Salad, Black Mission Fig, Perfect Blondes ($13) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=Rbdo67vnABZOVLH3xEqGAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5V\u2026</a>  This was dessert of string beans with fig and various spices, the most notable being (what I would guess as) mint. \u00a0Walnuts were a nice touch. \u00a0It's a nice simple appetizer, and the ingredients hold their own. \u00a0I felt it was a bit overpriced, but a good dish nonetheless. \u00a0Would have also be a fairly solid side dish for an entree. \u00a065%  -Cherry Tomato Tartlet, Basil, Balsamic ($13) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=ddqVs0X5FNEVq8uMBcy6Zg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5V\u2026</a>  One of the better appetizers of the evening. \u00a0This was a simple tomato tart, but executed well on every level, albeit the concept was more on the conservative side. \u00a0Tomatoes &amp; basil were fresh. \u00a0Just the right amount of basil &amp; balsamic were used. \u00a0The pastry crust has a nice tender texture to it. \u00a0temperature was perfectly warm. Good execution and good balance of pronounced flavors. \u00a081% \u00a0(four and a half stars).  -Cold Poached Foie Gras, Black Pepper, Sea Salt + Rhubarb Compote ($20) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=KS0m6WkOtGa3gJMUUcVAnw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5V\u2026</a>  Not a bad foie gras dish, although short of exceptional. \u00a0This was similar to some of the foie gras torchons that I've had prior. \u00a0Texture is rather dense, and it is predictably heavier. \u00a0Unfortunately the flavor of the foie was a bit more muted than I would have preferred. \u00a0I felt the flavors of the dish were brought out more by the pepper, salt, &amp; rhubarb jam. \u00a0I can't remember what bread was used, but I don't recall it being any better than the usual choice of brioche. \u00a0Portion size is reasonable however. \u00a050%  -Balcao of Raw Cod &amp; Oysters with Creme Fraiche <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5VcB6XuSp-C1mAggD_Cg?select=npaw3jwOfv4lK8t6rrHC2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eG5V\u2026</a>  The raw fish here isn't similar to Japanese Sashimi, Italian Crudo, or Ceviche. \u00a0It was too briney for my palate, and so are raw oysters. \u00a0One bite of this was already more than enough for me. \u00a0Just not my thing, but some of my dining companions enjoyed it more. \u00a0I'm not going to rate this because it's not something I would appreciate even if executed well.

I must've read the menu 10 times through before he told me and made my choice. The soup had rock shrimp, bread and eggs. I dont enjoy shrimps, but i'll eat it. The soup was more salty than garlic-y. There was one spoon where I actually was able to taste the garlic. I found myself dumping a bunch of the free bread into the soup to alleviate the saltiness, and i'm usually pretty good with salty foods. I think if the chef wasnt so heavy handed with the salt, the soup would've been pretty good, on the lighter side. Slightly reminiscent of chinese soup.  As far as the experience, I dont like being in fancy-smancy restaurants in general. For what it was, service was really nice--they were patient with our party of 18, especially when we were holding the table up for another large party. I felt pretty uncomfortable being there simply because it was obviously I didnt fit into their demographic of upper class diners.  I think I'm too much of a casual eater for this place--I really didnt need someone to unfold my napkin for me. That should've set something off in my head.  On the bright side, PLENTY of parking spaces in front of and around the restaurant. I was surprised since it was so close to the embarcadero, but its probably far enough from north beach to not attract a bazillion cars.",

    "review_text": "I am, no doubt, one of the most annoying non-Basque people in San Francisco to take out to a Basque restaurant. I try -- I really do -- but as someone who has spent a few months in the Basque Country, as someone who has literally seen almost every Basque movie to come out in the last twenty years, as someone who wrote a thesis on narrative representations of trauma and their implications on the construction of Basque national identity in the films of Julio Medem, as someone who spent three years taking Basque language courses... Well, I'm an overly-critical prick who expects all things Basque to be nothing less than completely authentic while simultaneously avoiding falling into easy stereotypes of Basqueness. Which, if you think about it, is totally impossible.\n  Of course, I realize that the authenticity factor is not the only axis upon which food is measured. The other one, of course, is the chichi factor. Cuisine can be completely authentic but still be disregarded by those who consider themselves epicureans simply because it lacks the appropriate chichi-ness. These people are, I would argue, fuckheads. Take, for instance, the Harvard professor I met at a conference in Milwaukee who I overheard say immediately after delivering a keynote address on how academics need to relate better to, respect more, and listen more carefully to, the general NASCAR-loving population of our country in order to have progressive change -- while drinking a martini in the hotel's top-floor martini bar that had a needlessly French name despite it being, you know, in the middle of Milwaukee -- that there are only two \"worthwhile cuisines -- cuisines, period -- in the world: the French, and the Chinese.\"\n  Obviously, Mr. Harvard Professor -- would-be savior of the palates of the underprivileged -- has never drank a gas station slurpee, eaten samosas sold by a street vendor in a sketchy alley, or devoured fried tortillas covered in cinnamon and sugar and washed them down with a jug of pulque at a country hut outside of Cuernavaca.\n  I've been to plenty of Basque restaurants, from tavernas in villages outside of Donostia to completely disgusting steak-houses-in-disguises next to truck stops in the San Joaquin Valley. As far as authenticity, Piperade falls somewhere in between. As far as chichi, well: it tries to bill itself as \"French\" Basque cuisine, when there really isn't much difference between French and Spanish Basque food, since it's a tiny-ass region to begin with; its menu says, \"West Coast Basque\" and we all know that that is a euphemism for \"California Fusion Yuppy Basque\"; they have many items on their menu that include mango; and many of the menu listings include the French name for the dish instead of the Basque name. So, yeah, it's up there.\n  Chock full o' chichi, I must admit, is not necessarily a bad thing. It resulted in, I'm sure, such a carefully constructed combination of fresh herbs, perfect golden raisins, ridiculously smooth and tangy goat cheese, and their placement inside of a just-ripe-enough piquillo pepper. It resulted in, no doubt, perfectly seared scallops. And, to be sure, it resulted in a fluffy mousse approximation of the oh-so-Spanish turron. In fact, I could have even dealt with a tad more chichi in my \"cod donostia\" \u00a0-- the Basque-iest of Basque dishes -- which was completely uninteresting and maybe even a bit overcooked.\n  But despite the inherent snobbishness of their attempt to Frenchify Basque food, Piperade's fusion approach is, in some ways, representative of the only possible solution to the nationalist violence that has plagued the Basque Country for so many years. Basque food is as dear to many Basques as it is to the rest of the world. Old Basque men in berets attend secret Men-only cooking society meetings where they trade -- and guard -- traditional recipes. They will argue that it is the best cuisine in the world, that they invented many French dishes long before the French. However, as important as the preservation of this tiny culture is, too much emphasis on authenticity only creates the kinds of perceptions of difference -- between Basques and Spaniards or French, for instance -- that have fueled both the terrorist organization ETA to commit violence against the Spanish as well as against Basques who do not support its cause and the conservative Spanish government to commit violence against and suspend the civil liberties of many Basques. Yes, I know that the chef at Piperade probably had no political message in mind when he added a slice of mango to a traditional Basque dish. Still, it's as good a place as any to start.",

Oh how the mighty have fallen. Maybe at one point this place deserved to be on Bauer's top 100 restaurants in SF...no longer.

Extremely tasty flaky crust...a great savory dish. - The foie gras was pretty good. It was served with a compote that overpowered the foie gras slightly, but was interesting  Avoid: Oh...so many things... - Saffron potatoes (just a cold plate of blah) - Mussels on a bread salad (not delicious like the bread salad at Zuni) - the piperade (served with a completely cooked poached egg, by a waiter with no shame...hah)  One final note: most people dining at this place are like 50-70 yrs old...kind of creates a sort of \"Retired Wall Street\" feel.

The menu mentions that the appetizers are small but the appetizer portions to me were pretty generous in comparison to other restaurants.   Dungeness Crab \"txangurro\" \u00a0- Best dish here. They split the appetizer into two plates for us and I was surprised that they gave so much. I was all prepared for this expensive appetizer to be super small but it wasn't. AND it was delicious Beef Crudo, Chile - TIP: If you order both this and the crab, eat this one first. Solid appetizer but definitely a more subtle flavor than the crab (which is not a bad thing at all) Seared Duck Filet - Duck was cooked so perfectly. And the carrots and sauce were surprisingly just as good as the duck itself! Caramel Custard \"koka\" - Basically, it's a flan dish. It's basically a really, really good flan.  Consistently great dishes. Would highly recommend for either a date or group of friends. It's surprisingly in a really quiet part of SF which is nice so it's relatively easy to find parking.",

    "review_text": "If a deft hand in the kitchen, a warm personality, and a genuine concern that his guests are enjoying themselves are the makings of a 'celebrity' chef, then Gerald Hirigoyen qualifies. It's not unusual to see him out front, schmoozing with dinners and graciously accepting their deserved compliments. The simple but stunning space, with its wooden beams, bold, colorful paintings, and subdued lighting, is a pleasant setting for the cuisine, a creative blend of his French Basque origins and contemporary California touches. The menu is divided into small and big plates; the former include options like garlic-spiced prawns, warm sheep's-milk cheese-and-ham terrine, white bean salad with eggs, chives, and anchovies, and garlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon, bread, and egg. Among the more substantial offerings, all priced below $20 - are piperade (a traditional dish of melted onions, peppers, tomatoes, and garlic) served with sauteed Serrano ham and poached egg, blue nose sea bass with brussel sprouts, and beast of chicken with roasted butternut squash. Each day Monday through Friday, a different Basque specialty - such as sauteed calamari in ink sauce or braised rabbit with prunes - is featured. Orange blossom beignets and kefir cheese yogurt with honey and caramelized nuts are irresistible desserts. Hirigoyen's culinary empire includes Piperade Cafe in Icehouse Alley (between Union \u00a0&amp; Green and Sansome &amp; Battery ), with a wide range of high quality take-out soups, salads, sandwiches, pastries, and coffee drinks, and the more informal Bocadillos, a sandwich-soup-and-tapas bar.",

    "review_text": "I buy a lot of groupons, bloomspots, yelp deals, etc Basically if it is a deal I'll consider it. BUT I am picky. I first look at the Yelp reviews - anything over 3.5 stars I'll consider, but I also look at the amount (sometimes too much money for a meal for 2, sometimes just an awkward denomination for a meal, sometimes limitations on WHEN it can be used, really I do my research.  Anyway I have not been to this restaurant, but it had 4 stars and the deal from TravelZoo looked great - 2 glasses of champagne, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts - all for $69. (the deal said they add 18% tip and tax, and was worth about $140). \u00a0I LOVE that they included the champagne, and that there were TWO desserts and TWO apps- often these deals only include 1 to share, and I love my man, but I'll rock paper scissor him for the 3 beignet every time, and if I lose, he often lets me have it any way. - what can I say? I'm a lucky gal. \u00a0(FYI so is he, I'm the one who buys ll these groupons - he just has to leave the tip!)  Now I NEVER let a groupon expire, and I never lose them, I have a system, \u00a0I print them out right away, highlight the expire date and stack them in expiration date order. \u00a0This one was coming up and so I called on Friday for a reservation for the following Thursday the deal was set to expire on Sunday. \u00a0They said they had 9pm...not really my style. \u00a0Then they said they were \"extending the expire date\" \u00a0FANTASTIC, the following Thursday was great with me, 6:30 please.  We arrive into a beautiful space, and are seated against the wall with a nice view of the dining room (well I had a nice view of the dining room). Our sweet waiter Jean (something) was very gracious about the voucher and asked if we would like our champagne - INDEED. \u00a0  I ordered the ham terrine, and let me tell ya, I am still dreaming about it, hard to describe, check out the photos and what looks like potatoes on top is really sliced serrano ham fried up like crispy bacon, and blew my mind \u00a0- on top of a frisee salad. You had me at \"ham\". \u00a0  in order to maximize the voucher's deal, we ordered the 2 most expensive entrees, the steak and the rack of lamb with sausage. \u00a0I cook a mean rack of lamb, and while this was cooked to a perfect med rare, I think I do a better job of seasoning on the grill, but the mergeuz sausage was awesome, and the figgy/fruit sauce was quite nice. The steak was actually better than the lamb, and I almost NEVER order steak in a restaurant, why bother, you can get it anywhere and cook it yourself if you are so inspired, but the steak was better than the lamb. Again cooked perfectly and the size of my foot - HUGE. \u00a0(we had leftovers enough for a steak egg taco for breakfast for my man and a petite lunch sammy for me.)  I think we fumbled a bit on our dessert selection - the orange beignets were great, but we ordered the almond cake - which was good, but I could have used some chocolate and there were a few selections.  Like I said we did not finish our steak, so I asked the nice waiter to package it up WITH the delish bread we had leftover - YUP, I'm exactly that cheap, but they were gonna just throw it away anyway right?  I wanna go back, sit at the bar and get a big glass of red wine and that crispy ham terrine...drool",

We ordered the stuffed peppers, halibut, and the calamari with squid ink rice. I probably wouldn't get the peppers again, the whole nuts just didn't do it for me. Our calamari dish was so good that I'm hungry again thinking about it. I had black squid in all over my mouth. We had a good laugh.  Desserts could use a modern touch and their drinks need help. I suggest hiring a new mixologist to spice things up and bring in a younger crowd.",

Refreshing, delicious &amp; a great start to dinner.  \u00a4 Prawns (3*), from the Txikitos menu. They swim in a bath of Basque Ketchup &amp; Lemon Confit. Almost reminds me of shrimp cocktail but without the horse radish burn. It's good.  \u00a4 Braised Seafood (5*). This tomatoe based sauce is devine. The seafood is delicious &amp; I can lick this dish dry. Yum yum.  \u00a4 Veal Stew (4*). This was the days special. Another great broth/sauce. Veal stock to be exact. Glad we went with the special. The Veal was fall apart tender, juicy &amp; so flavorful.  \u00a4 Warm French Apple Tart (4*). If you're into warm Apple pie or fruit tarts then you'll love this. A thin crispy crust, sliced apple filling &amp; caramel drizzle. Mmm mm.  \u00a4 Biarritz Rocher (5*), this is the Milk Chocolate + Hazelnut dessert. Chocolatey, creamy mouse with a crunchy bottom crust. Loved the texture &amp; loved the taste. Not too sweet, just right. Wifey being the chocolate lover she is loves this dessert.",

    "review_text": "I grew up eating Basque cuisine, and I don't know, Piperade didn't really fit the bill of what I had been expecting.   Basque restaurants are kind of hard to find, so I was excited about Piperade! I had been expecting a foodie's delight, more of a familial cuisine and environment (larger portions, moms, kids, grandmas, etc.), agricultural atmosphere (because Basque people are that way! My family's favorite Basque restaurant was in Chino, CA- cow country!). I wasn't expecting something cheap- a hamburger heaven, or a place with coloring menus for kids, but I was thinking it would be a little different.   Piperade had good food, but the experience was rather unmemorable, and was not the Basque restaurant I had wanted so desperately to replicate in San Francisco.  My BF has a seafood AND nut allergy and he was limited to 2 items on their menu (other than salad)... who wants to go to a Basque restaurant and eat salad? I got the lamb, he got the steak and fries. (safe and boring, but he had no other choice.)   I'd seen Piperade on \"Check Please Bay Area\" and had been dying to go, and it was awhile before I could get a reservation. In fact, despite our reservation, we ended up standing, waiting. I can comment that that fact was a little awkward because they do not have a foyer or waiting area. They had an extensive wine list, and the place itself was very beautiful with its wooden beams and large windows, but in a location that was out of the way from the hustle of Broadway, but close enough.  Though intimate and refined, I still left a bit disappointed. Piperade is part of a group that also includes Bocadillos, so maybe I should try that before I give up on Basque SF. We'll see.",

    "review_text": "Always one of my favorites, not trendy, the style was trendy 15 years \u00a0and they haven't changed since opening 8 years ago. \u00a0The menu is an ecclectic mix of French, Spanish (i.e. Basque), Californian, and just, well, food. \u00a0Dungeness crab tower in a house-made red pepper aioli surrounded by little pieces of vegetables, for example, good, tart, and tasty, but crab was all shredded (meaning, either the leftovers from the shellfish stew or they bought it commercially) yet had several large-ish pieces of shell (meaning, someone shelled a fresh crab). \u00a0  The first 3/4 of dinner I was a little disappointed. \u00a0Flavors were mild, not much spice, when they put out for you it's in extremely subtle ways, like your very normal looking chicken has surprisingly crispy skin and perfectly square 1mm almond slices. \u00a0It was dry, but cooked with a precision that smacks you down with a vengeance, no way in a million years can you cook chicken like that in your home oven. \u00a0It was like a beach bully beating you up on an off day without really trying or caring, and you, strangely, enjoying and admiring him for his skill.  No warm-and-fuzzies. \u00a0Service was a little curt, stiff, and confused in a French way - they were out of quite a few items on the menu by 9:30 on a Friday night, and didn't bother to figure that out until the table-side apology. \u00a0There was no talk of artisan farms or what the waiter's housing situation was like, it was all very formal. \u00a0You sensed the waiter could toss a table setting perfectly aligned in three seconds in his sleep...with his feet... but did not feel the urge, so it was all a little askew.  The crowd was 40-60 but a few younger ones, one of the rare age-integrated fine dining restaurants in town. \u00a0Decor is a double-sized version of Globe, comfy, dark, red brick walls with substantial seismic bracing, bustling, noisy but not too noisy, \u00a0 On the front table they feature a few books written by their chef, Hirigoyen. \u00a0Sounds Japanese but he's Basque and he's left a trail of wonderful restaurants in his wake: Pastis, Fringle (back when it was the shiz), Piperade, and now Bocadillos.  Somewhere between the bussers trying to take the plates for the third time and my sopping everything up in their excellent homemade bread, I slid unknowingly into a food bliss. \u00a0The sauce on that chicken was good, beyond good, it was damn good. \u00a0It's hard to pinpoint it, but something happened here that's happened every time, a deep sense of calm, connection, and contentment. \u00a0It all fits together here like a puzzle, a glove in a hand. \u00a0There is a deep rightness here. \u00a0This is what food is all about, why we desperate creatures are born to eat. \u00a0They answered that desperate question of human yearning with something you really enjoy eating. \u00a0\"If you come back tomorrow we will have it\", the waiter said, after explaining that the only two desserts we wanted were sold out. \u00a0And right now, I'm pretty tempted. \u00a0The dessert menu is intriguing, saliva-inducing, and inscrutable unless you know French cuisine or Wikipedia it all on your iPhone.  I've been pretty blunt about Piperade but really, it is one of the better restaurants, I would take a visiting relative here, or choose it for a romantic date, or just come to enjoy. \u00a0There is a lot going on here, there is nothing superficial, easy, or glib about it. \u00a0It's like an indy film, it makes you think about the subject. \u00a0But it's an American film. \u00a0You know, happy ending, you leave feeling whole and uplifted. \u00a0Highly recommended.",

I'll start with the cons and work my way into the good stuff  so first thing, the address on <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a> is incorrect, the address is actually 1015 battery between Union and Green streets. I think it's listed as between pacific and Broadway which through us for a loop so i had to call the restaurant for the address which i explained to the woman who wanted to put me on hold (seriously, i work in customer service, it would have taken 2 seconds to tell me) so I walked the 4 blocks to the restaurant until the hostess was back on the line...didn't need the address anymore, but still...annoying.  Ok, so we step in and instantly i felt two things; 1. i was the youngest the person in the room (I'm nearly 30) 2. the old white man's republican convention was at La Piperade  My boyfriend (who is French and doesn't know proper terminology) said it was pretentious...the point is, it was stuffy.  After we got the stare down from the hostess who couldn't answer simple questions on the phone, we were seated...  We had a nice table at the end of the restaurant \u00a0near the bathrooms, and kitchen...yay! Our server was nice, the bf insisted she was related to the chef...she only spoke French to us,assuming we both spoke French. not a problem, it's a beautiful language...  We ordered: Appetizers:  Oyster tartare with lemon creme fraiche  foie gras with peach compote  1 star for the tartare...just not my thing, WAY too fishy and the lemon...um, no. fyi, my bf LOVED this...he says it's really French. 5 stars for the foie gras-buttery, smooth, delicious and paired with my fav...something sweet. Dash a little salt on top and WOW!!  Entrees: 5 stars for the garlic roasted salmon 5 stars for the pacific snapper with spinach  both really great entrees...I had the snapper...it was light and delicious. A warm vinagrette smothered on and around it...really good stuff. The roasted salmon was beautiful on top of a creamy risotto side..really nice, not what you expect form looking at the creamy brown sauce. very recommended.  Desserts: 5 stars...anything you get.

I came away satisfied with a curiosity of how I could recreate the dishes rather than the feeling that I could have done the same, if not better.   - Bread - generous Acme? whole wheat sourdough levain w. excellent olive oil.  - Appetizer - Cold poached foie gras w. quince compote - accompanied by a sprinkled streak of sea salt &amp; ground pepper; served w. thin toasted wheat bread. The sweet-tart quince (texture of applesauce) and crunchiness of the salt paired w. the fatty duck wonderfully. The waiter automatically split our appetizer into 2 portions without prompting. Very good, silky, smooth, the flavor of duck was delicate, not the least bit strong. - Seared duck breast w. sunchokes, cippolini &amp; huckleberry sauce - Wow. incredible. Thick duck medallions perfectly medium rare came w. its crispy skin. Surprisingly the tart huckleberry sauce accompanied it so well. The sunchokes (jerusalem artichokes / potato like tubers) were thin shaved and stirfried until crispy. More assertive flavor than potato, I kept digging under my duck to unearth more sunchokes. Wonderfully harmonious dish. The only dissent came from the fresh italian parsley sprinkled over the chokes &amp; onions, green flavor was a bit overpowering.  - Lamb chops w. potato confit, fennel &amp; some sort of relish - lamb came in thick portions, also very well cooked, great flavor. I appreciated the deviation from typical rosemary or mint seasonings. This one used a light cumin seasoning. great lamb. The potatoes were well-cooked, perhaps needed a bit more salt (i'm not a huge fan of potatoes), fennel was braised, not much flavoring beyond its own slight licorice taste, a little bland.  - Dessert - Orange blossom beignets - very light, airy, almost like a soft choux batter. Moist inside, well dusted w. powdered sugar (dough was not too sweet). Also not particularly drawn to orange blossom essence but this was not overwhelming. - Coffee - flavorful, not bitter. excellently paired w. dessert  Bar manager was extremely rude &amp; put-offish. Waiter was nice, attentive, and professional.   Friday night w. reservations, the place was packed. The dining area is an unusual angular shaped open space with wooden floors and warm lighting. There's a nifty recycled wine bottle chandelier centerpiece over a large round family table.   In summary:  Very good food, well prepared. Different from the conventional French style of preparation or Spanish flavors. I'm interested in trying a fish dish sometime.",

Service is uneven sometimes, but we've never had a really bad experience.  The calamari a la pancha is a delicious starter made with fennel, capers, olive and lemon. \u00a0The calamari is rendered soft but not too chewy and the brightness of the flavors are a delight. The seafood stew is a winner, generously filled with scallops, prawns, mussels, clams and halibut. \u00a0While you can't go wrong with the seafood items, the NY steak is well executed too.   Chef Gerald Hirigoyen started his career as a pastry chef in France, so don't miss dessert: we went for a classic tarte tatin topped with soft apples and drizzled with caramel sauce. Divine!  On a recent visit, we shared the app and dessert and the kitchen already split the dishes for us, so that's why the portions look small. Although I prefer to have the dish come as a whole, it just looks better for my pictures ;-) \u00a0  Piperade is a bustling spot for lunch, but I like coming here at night because of the readily available street parking!

The entrees were good, but both seemed like the vegetables were overcooked and had lost some of their zest. Piperade- Serrano ham with peppers and mixed veggies- good, but not worth a special trip. Cod with Fennel and vegetables- More noteable, although the fennel was overcooked and had lost it's unique flavor and texture.  Drinks were STRONG!  Dessert- Gateau Basque was worth the trip alone- excellent!  Service was a little slow at times, and I did get a glass of sour sherry, which was replaced with a better one afterwards... some time later... Pet peeves.  All in all a great experience, although clearly the best value is the entree prix fixe with soup, salad and dessert for under $40, our meal was easily twice that per person by the time we were out the door.",

I live on T-Hill and although I'm right off of Union and so is Pip\u00e9rade, we are 500 steps and a hillside apart. I guess that doesn't really make us that close! So the other night I thew on a pair of flats, stuffed my heels into my purse to thwart off the Clutz Clause, and set out on a nice walk down the Filbert Steps.  Pip\u00e9rade, the sister restaurant to Bocadillos, is casually decorated with architectural warmth and sports a similarly styled menu. Brick walls (like many FinDi buildings), low ceilings, raw wood beams, and a \"chandelier\" of empty wine bottles had me momentarily transferred to wine country. There was a good mix of ages present and my people watching radar was tuned up high. Most unusual spotting: A white haired man dressed in white pants, white leather motorcycle jacket holding a white double wine carrier. Sean Connery couldn't have been smoother.  Well, let's get right to it. I decided to lean towards tradition and went with their famed Garlic Soup and signature dish of Pip\u00e9rade. \"Huh?\" That's what I said. So, I Wikipedia'ed it on my phone while sitting in front of the menu. Oh yeah, I'm totally \"THAT person\"! And so you don't have to be, here's what Pip\u00e9rade is:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPiperade&amp;s=f95b8708c5d94615929af2b60708bee07fdc7093413c09245fbf0ca8ee45c815\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi\u2026</a>  Don't you feel better now? It was just as they say: a wonderful combination of bright, peppery flavors with light fluffy pieces of egg, a yolk to break, and jamon sarrano. It served as a nice accompaniment to Monday's special of Sweet Breads, which I recommend sharing. Both dishes were tasty, but to eat that many slippery lumps of lamb in one sitting could quite seriously make a person ill! As to their Garlic Soup, it was so glorious that I gave mine up to the Birthday Guest of Honor. I reluctantly ate a bowl of the Potato Leek soup, which we all agreed screamed for a little salt and pepper, and then wished it had been my birthday.  They kindly let us stay til the lights went out in the kitchen and our server, who taught us a little Basque, was lookin' like a Monday night was just not the same as Saturday. Sometimes a 3 hour dinner is just what you need!",

    "review_text": "I went to a wine supplier lunch here yesterday, and it was my first time experiencing Piperade (although I have dined at Bocadillos once before).   I ordered the txangurro crab app to start. It was a composed salad of dungeness crab meat (in a tall cylinder form), with brunoised mango and roasted red pepper around the bottom. I didn't taste much of the alleged basil accompaniment, and I had to repeatedly salt the crab meat as well so I ended up giving away a lot of it to the other diners. I was a bigger fan of everyone else's starters: the warm white bean salad (although I didn't try any of the anchovy or egg accompaniments) and especially the mushroom pie - this was basically a seasonal mushroom tart with creme fraiche. It had the most amazing savory flavor tempered by the creamy goodness - I will be back for that!  My seafood &amp; shellfish stew entree was just okay. There was a giant head-on prawn, several tentacly (rubbery) baby octopi, a couple scallops, and some thoroughly overcooked fish chunks (salmon? whitefish? not sure). The flavors of the broth also needed to be more developed, and I was looking for a toasted bread slice smeared with romesco or something. I thought it would be a Basque interpretation of cioppino or bouillabaisse, but I was so disappointed. Once again, everyone else's dishes were great. Clearly, I need to order differently next time. The sea bass entree came with some of the best brussels sprouts ever - they were almost blackened and were braised with bacon - plus there was some buttery froth all around the plate. The burger looked a little unwieldy but tasted good, with just the right amount of cheese (Ossau Iraty, a sharp little Basque cheese). I only tried one fry and it was kinda limp, but the spicy ketchup was great on the burger. The duck confit Plat du Jour looked very good as well, nice crispy skin and plated with green lentils, but she didn't want to share.  The desserts were all-around fantastic though: the traditional Gateau Basque was a little slice of heaven - almond cake served with a cherry compote - and the Rocher dessert is a must-try (although a little hard to eat since it is semi-frozen and there are whole hazelnuts on the top). I would definitely come back to try the orange blossom beignets and the roasted pineapple clafoutis.  I am giving three stars because of the general under-seasoning of my dishes, plus the extremely slow service. Our waitress was a lovely little Basque woman, but we were not on Basque time! It took almost half an hour to get our orders in, and while the food/desserts came rather quickly, espresso/the check/etc did NOT. Our companions had to call their next appt to cancel because we were there for so long. We arrived at 12:30 and left at about 2:45!  Get a more attentive server and the salt shaker in the rotation and I would give 5 stars. Until my next visit...",

    "review_text": "Disappointing, for an upscale establishment in the Financial District. I have the sense that they often do better than they did last night, but last night was \"off\" in a few important ways.  I arrived quite early, at 6:45pm for a 7:15pm reservation; and as such, had absolutely no expectation that I would be seated early. My expectation was to have a cocktail at the bar and await my friend's arrival. However, since I was there anyway, I figured I'd announce myself to the Ma\u00eetre d so they would know I was present. So I did, then I went to take a seat at the bar, however there weren't any seats. So I walked outside and took a seat on the stairs of the chiropractor's office nextdoor and waited a bit. Understandable, so far everything was as one would expect.  My friend arrived and we announced ourselves at 7:10pm for our 7:15pm reservation. We were told that our table wasn't ready yet, but that there were two seats at the bar, and we were welcome to sit there until they were ready for us. So we walked through the crowded restaurant to the two seats at the back of the bar, to be informed by someone that they were \"saved\" for his two friends who were in the restroom. So we cancelled our order with the bartender and walked BACK to the front of the restaurant to wait again.  At 7:30pm we were told our table (7:15 reservation) was almost ready. And again at 7:45pm. At 7:50pm we were offered complimentary cocktails since we had to wait so long. At 8:00pm we were finally seated. In the meantime, I had to call and cancel an appointment I had made for after dinner; there was no way I could make it on time. That appointment had to be rescheduled for next Friday, as they had no other openings beforehand... so now my schedule for the week is skewed and my weekend plans have to be adjusted. Really annoying.  The food was fairly hit-or-miss. Credit where credit is due; the stuffed piquillo pepper was flavorful and delicious. Though the menu said peppers and it was, in reality, one small pepper (for $14). It was fantastic and totally worth getting, even at that price, but a bit misleading and I was already cranky at this point. We ordered the pommes frites as well, and they were amongst the best shoestring french fries I've ever had. The Calamari Txipiroa, however, which was their special of the night, was really not a dish I enjoyed at all. I don't know what \"ink sauce\" is supposed to taste like, and perhaps the dish was prepared flawlessly and I simply have a peasant's palate, but to me the entire dish tasted like smoke and rice. I actually left it mostly unfinished on my plate. The orange blossom beignets somewhat made up for this, as they were perfection.  In summary, a delightful aesthetic, poor organization and time management, cursory efforts to compensate us for a fairly ridiculous wait, some really good dishes, some really unpleasant dishes, and pricey.  I probably wouldn't return; in a city with so many high-end restaurants, I suspect that there's just better out there.",

Everything from the Poached Foie Gras to the rack of lamb to the Veal stew was tasty, hearty, and quite delicious.   I was expecting a bit from the desserts, especially if Michael Bauer raved about the Beignets, but desserts were nothing special.   Service was great, but nothing too outstanding. Restaurant was fairly spacious and not too cramped, most or all the tables were for 4 people, so seating 2 at a 4-seater made it feel spacious. The crowd is also very energetic and makes you want to just stay and linger on for a little while after your meal",

We had:  APP: (1) warm sheep milk + ham terrine. \u00a0SO GOOD! \u00a0Crispy on the outside, melty on the inside. \u00a0It looks a bit funky but just cut it up and eat it with bread. \u00a0It's very salty but sooo good. \u00a0 (2) serrano ham - delicious if you're a ham fan, which I am!  ENTREE: (3) rack of lamb - so tender and juicy and perfectly medium rare. \u00a0I ate it separately from the cumin fig sauce so I could just enjoy the lamb flavor. \u00a0decent portion considering it's rack of lamb. (4) snapper with spinach - so soft and moist, really well cooked. \u00a0loved the garlic chips on top.   DESSERT: (5) orange blossom bignets. \u00a0A delicious surprise. \u00a0Orange blossom fragrance was so subtle and wonderful. \u00a0As some other reviewers said, they're more akin to the Chinese egg puff pastries rather than a really doughy ball. \u00a0I love both, and I loved this airy light texture. \u00a0 (6) Basque tart with cherries -- really good, although this wasn't the stand out dish, but that's probably b/c everything else was so good!  WINE:  (7) the cote de provence rose is delicious (I think there's only one by the glass). \u00a0So light, perfumy, and perfect with the snapper. (8) garnatxa- went really well with the lamb. (9) white dessert wine - can't remember the name but man it was soo good! \u00a0  Wine list is great. \u00a0We had a fabulous time and I would definitely recommend it. \u00a0Enjoy!",

Dining companion had been there several years ago and still remembered it = must be pretty good. Decided on several small plates. \u00a0Garlic soup, special of asparagus soup, mussel salad, white bean salad, sheep milk cheese terrine, mushroom pie. \u00a0 That garlic soup is delicious. Straight up. Reminds me of some kind of Chinese soup. Probably due to egg floating in it. Really garlicky, bacon, egg, and perfectly cooked rock shrimp. Not rubbery at all. How do they do that in a boiling soup? I would order that anywhere over and over again. Did not share it, though that was original plan. Asparagus soup. Eh. not my thing. Companion liked it. Mussel salad- well, i mistakenly thought we were getting steamed mussels. My fault for not reading. Still, it was really good, though seeing mussels out of shell struck me as odd. Didn't stop me from gobbling it up. \u00a0White bean salad very tasty. Not a whole lot different than something I'd get at maybe Whole foods. Well, maybe a bit better. Also wiped plate clean. Mushroom pie kinda disappointed me. Was barely warn, crust not so much that of tart (i.e. shortening and flour), but more like flaky pastry that's toughened or sat around too long. Tasted ok, but not exciting. The Terrine was also not what I anticipated. I thought it would be melted cheese in a casserole, as I'd had at \u00a0a few Spanish places. Nope. It's layered cheese and ham that appeared to be pan-fried. I love salt but this was WAY too salty for me. My friend loved it. Thought it was the best thing we had. I enjoyed small bits of it atop the mushroom pie. It was just way too salty (and quite greasy) for me. Though we were both really full , especially after eating 2 baskets of bread (did I mention we were hungry?), we still got dessert. From these reviews it seems most are comped a couple glasses of the sparkling dessert wine. We were as well. Very nice, not too sweet but just right. I got the hazelnut chocolate Rocher mousse and he got the caramel custard. Both were very tasty. I prefer chocolate and I like Ferrero Rocher chocolates, so the crust made of what seemed to be melted Rocher was really lovely. We were both stuffed afterwards, and both very happy with dinner. Service and food was exceptionally good. All in all I guess it does warrant 5 stars.",

Our bread was KICKIN---that's the way I like my carbs...Olde World recipes with nice crunch, and chew, light on the interior. Some ratio of wheat..yum!!! The dip was an Arbequina olive oil that was SOOO good and awesome, I asked where to buy it (Berk Bowl).  Our calamari starter was wonderful. Loved the Basque flavors of olive oil, tapenade, etc  Dessert was the best, with a milk chocolate hazel nutty, rice crispy layer, with large shavings of more chocolate to cover. Deeelish.",

We arrived early for our 7:30 reservation, but were not seated until close to 8. It would have been nice to receive a complimentary appetizer or glass of wine for our wait, but we were given nothing.

I like my soups thick with pieces of things otherwise it tastes too much like baby food.  Blue-nosed sea bass was good &amp; served with some green stuff that looked like a cross between asparagus &amp; broccoli (apparently called brocollini).  Snapper was good (not great) had too much cayenne pepper on it, overpowered the actual taste of the fish and was served with A LOT of spinach (the spinach was really good)!  The chicken was ok, but could have been more tender. The mushrooms that were served with it were really good.  The desserts were my favorite part: a Basque cake with cherries (and almond flavoring) &amp; an almond cake with pear and cream fraiche.  The atmosphere definitely made the restaurant. Piperade is forgettable, but better than a bad memory! I would definitely go back for the atmosphere.",

Main course: - Roasted halibut: I thought this dish was also very delicious! \u00a0I'm a huge fish person and though I don't remember clearly what exactly I enjoyed about the dish, I remember feeling thoroughly satisfied.  Dessert: - Almond and pear tartlet: very good!  We also ordered a nice bottle of wine. \u00a0Unfortunately I can't remember the details of our meal, but I definitely remember that I was impressed and thought to myself as I was walking out of the restaurant, that I would have to come back again.",

    "review_text": "hm. I wonder when I'll ever look old enough to be respected in fancy restaurants like this. Eating at a restaurant like this that reminds me of how much one's appearance determines the level and quality of service one receives.   In any case, my friend and I came here for our monthly blackboard eats dinner saturday night. There is really nothing to complain about the food in my opinion. We shared one entree, the saturday night entree of a veal stew, which was kindly split by the kitchen for us. We had the mussels, the cheese and ham terrine and the dungness crab salad for small plates. All were delicious though my friend found bits of shell in the dungness crab and I thought the mussels were occasionally gritty.   I had a glass of urxi, which was a slightly fizzy white wine from the basque region.   As to the service, it wasn't horrible, not at all. It was just disconcerting to be treated dismissively by the waiter. When I as pondering the wines I asked a question and which he answered, then he turned away before I could ask anything else and walked away which was just strange. However, our water glasses were always full, dirty plates were cleared fairly quickly and they asked us if we wanted more bread so I suppose this speaks well of the busboys.   In any case, this is not a place to go for the casual meal unless you're old enough to have an expense account. \u00a0I definitely couldn't have afforded it without the coupon. We actually tried to make a lunch reservation, which isn't served on the weekends, but our schedules weren't working out.   In sum, good food, decent portions (nothing too generous), street parking, excellent service if you look old - fine otherwise. I think that's all one would want to know. I'm not really knowledgeable enough to comment on the wine.",

    "review_text": "4.5 STARS  Mr. NSS: \"Wow, this would make a great first date place!\"  *Looks at menu prices*  Mr. NSS: \"Ummm, I meant 20th date place.\" Me: \"20th date place?!?!\"  Mr. NSS: \"Yah, you know...once you've secured the goods.\" *Wink Wink* Me: \"No, I don't know what you mean *Wink Wink*...women are NOT cargo on a ship, you know!\"  Mr. NSS: \"Geesus, is it that time of the month again?\"  Whether it's the 1st or 20th date, Piperade is definitely a solid choice for date night. Fantastic food and strong cocktails in a sexy yet rustic ambiance with dim lighting, exposed red brick walls and wooden furnishings with crisp white linen clothed tables. They also have an outdoor dining area which is perfect for those rare warm city nights and a private room to accommodate larger parties (up to 30). Piperade is nestled in a more desolate area between North Beach and the Embarcadero which makes finding free street parking after 6 pm a breeze.   Acclaimed as the top basque chef in America, Chef Hirigoyen's menu focuses on Californian influenced Spanish and French Basque dishes. Every dish we had was very well-executed and packed a big punch of flavor which justified the high prices for the portion sizes. For a less spendy meal, try his other nearby restaurant, Bocadillos (next door to Bubble Lounge) which focuses more on Spanish Tapas. \u00a0  We started with the Dungeness Crab \"Txangurro\" w/ Orange, Grapefruit, Basil &amp; Aioli ($16): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F12J1KCr&amp;s=30d58c953e544fa129d79fc300e4f08a663ba3f36ca86e18f275f1a673912f40\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/12J1KCr</a> which was a tower of freshly shredded sweetly tender crab. It was a very light and refreshing way to start a meal. While Mr. NSS grappled the crab appetizer, I lusted over our second appetizer, the Piquillo Pepper Stuffed w/ Goat Cheese Topped w/ Pistachios, Golden Raisins ($14): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F140RAZI&amp;s=72b686326c6c77556b902286add59da31d2b340a2c6f27f048540b8fe927cd49\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/140RAZI</a>. An absolute must order, the goat cheese was like devouring creamy, fluffy clouds with a nice textural contrast from the crunchy pistachios. The golden raisins gave it a lovely pop of sweetness.   For our mains, Mr. NSS had the Roasted Rack of Lamb w/ Merguez Sausage, Fennel, Cumin &amp; Date Relish ($32): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1600lUZ&amp;s=bd00980a0ffaeb32ea88c9e50d917f751eb83c3edcbb56b7d5e99c5e7bec2be5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1600lUZ</a>. The lamb was succulently tender but the date relish was what made the dish; it was like a savory and tart honey glaze. I was delighted with my Seared Duck Filet w/ Braised Carrots, Coriander, Orange &amp; Green Olives ($29): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14yZ87Z&amp;s=0fde99c6107e8f13da083f14ec1f800f341250e9364de6142b34f92bccd48e8c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/14yZ87Z</a>.. One of the best duck dishes I've had, \u00a0the breast was perfectly rendered and seared leaving a deliciously crunchy skin atop. The breast was lean yet had a luxurious fatty flavor. Loved the accompanying sweetly crisp braised carrot as well. The better half grappled half of my duck breast because yes, it was THAT good. I didn't mind because I had dessert all to myself (Mr. NSS doesn't eat sweets). The Biarritz Rocher ($9) was calling my name on the menu and it was a wise choice: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F12qa1tF&amp;s=53ca960db62a5630d2e71f76ec8e0090688791bb56322e1d83f7d4b14b798bed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/12qa1tF</a>. A Ferrero Rocher in dessert form, this was THE best dessert I've ever had. The chocolate mousse was divinely light and airy while the hazelnut crust was chock-full of crunchy hazelnut bits. Words can't describe how heavenly this dessert. GET THIS!  Service was friendly and very timely though not very polished. Dishes were abruptly plopped on our table without any explanation by the food runner while our waiter was stretched thin. He had to tend to our section and the outdoor dining area which understandably lowered the attentiveness. Had service been a tad better, this would definitely be a solid 5 star review.   Piperade is easily one of my top picks for date night especially if you want to \"secure the goods\" as Mr. NSS so eloquently put it.   Oh yah, no date is complete with starting with one or two...ok, three cocktails. I had the tequila based Spring in Biarritz ($10): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F11inn6s&amp;s=ee3a25b17c7908aaaee95c14cd4fb57b2473a8e8f2df53c6bd27b22e944fa2ac\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/11inn6s</a>.

The food enjoyed included: - Mushroom tartlet. VERY RICH, creamy and probably 1000 calories. Good, but thank goodness I only had 1/2 of one.  - Rack of lamb with cumin-date sauce, veggies and fennel bulb. For the longest time, we couldn't figure out what the mystery white vegetable was --- cabbage? onion? artichoke? --- No, apparently it's fennel. Ok, moving on the meat. The lamb was cooked exactly as we requested with a charred outside. The veggies were also very well seasoned.  - Steak with a small sauce-platter of romesco and broccoli rabe. I've never had romesco with steak and it was brilliant. Need to try that at home next time. The broccoli rabe had parmesan cheese melted on top which really hid the bitterness of the rabe well. Delicious! And of course, the steak was PERFECTLY cooked with a crusty, grilled outside.  - Dessert: Dark chocolate cake with cr\u00e8me fraiche. It was like a dark chocolate flourless cake. Good, but nothing special.  The restaurant doesn't have anything that you probably haven't had at other restaurants, but it's probably cooked better at Piperade.   Service was also very attentive even though we were probably the youngest people there that night. Also loved the d\u00e9cor including the wine bottle chandelier, although the round table that seats 10 under it was unusually large, which made it difficult for people to talk to anyone other than the people directly next to them.",

The ambiance of this place is awesome as it is dark wood floors, ceiling and a cool ass wine chandelier in the center of the room. \u00a0We started off with the 2 glasses of champagne and some bread, and then had the calamari app and some crispy fries for the little one. \u00a0Next course for me was the rack of lamb which was delicious and a nice size portion. \u00a0The flavors of the food were really nice and not something I am accustomed to. \u00a0It really felt like I was transported to Spain in a tiny village along a rural street.

I spent two weeks eating my way through Spain recently (think seared foie gras pintxos, black pudding, creamy discs of goat cheese, fried calamari sandwiches, deep fried chorizitos, grilled padron peppers, creme catalans topped perfectly charred sugar, arroz negro with seafood, etc.) so the bar was set extremely high.   Piperade is great - on a relatively quiet part of Battery Street, the exposed brick dining room is warm and inviting, service is efficient, and the tapas portions are just right. We tried the grilled calamari in a tangy but savory tomato sauce, bacalao tartare with raw oysters and aioli, garlic soup with shrimp and croutons, and the crabmeat tower with veggies and microgreens. On an SF restaurant scale of 1-10, I give it a 7, which is pretty high considering the quantity and quality of good food in this city. However, as I said before, the bar for Spanish/Basque tapas is set extremely high, and ultimately, Piperade failed to wow me.",

The translation from menu description to plate falls just a wee bit short of expectation, however. \u00a0The house specialty (piperade) was flavorful, but the unanimous impression was that it would be better as a breakfast dish. \u00a0The seabass and snapper were dry and rather small portions at $26 each. \u00a0The chicken and steak were good but not outstanding. \u00a0The desserts were all amazing, and I agree with the reviewer that declared \"the desserts are much better than the main courses.\"  I can't wait to come back on a warm summer evening for a glass of wine and small plates on the open patio. \u00a0This is a great spot to take family visiting from out of town or an intimate dinner pour deux.",

Service- sucked. Once our waiter found out we had a travel zoo voucher, with a mandatory gratuity we barely saw him. My water glass was constantly empty and we were forced to stay about 20 min longer than I wanted to BC I couldn't track him down to deliver the check. Food- meh. Stuffed pepper was good. Really good. The Dungeness crab was weird. Tasted more like tuna. Entrees were just bad. New York steak was super chewy. Only ate half. My salmon was undercooked and over buttered. Barely touched it. I didn't even have the energy to complain. It was so damn hot in there and they sat us under some kind of goddamn flood light. I was sweating like a hooker in church. The saving grace and only thing from keeping this above zero stars...the deserts. I had apple tart. Friggin bomb. My gf got the chocolate cake. Really good too. Either way, glad I tried this place. Because I was always curious and now I know to stay far away. The price is too high. The food and service too crappy to ever consider going back. Much better basque influenced restaurants within walking distance.",

    "review_text": "We had been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile, based on some favorable reviews from friends and my parents. It is wise to make a reservation; the restaurant was packed on the week-night that we chose to go. My husband, our infant daughter and my parents were seated immediately at the only available table as soon as we arrived at the time of our reservation. The service was excellent and they helped allocate space for my daughter's stroller. The food was truly the star of the evening! We were collectively blown away by the repast. We shared a bottle of wine from the basque country as well as appetizers: calamari and cheese selection. I ordered a soup that was so good, we bought the restaurant's cookbook that evening (I just happened to notice it by the hostess in the front of the restaurant) so that I could mimic it back in Montreal (which I did just two nights after arriving home). The garlic soup with rock shrimp was perhaps the best part of my meal - if you go and you love the 'stinking rose' as much as I do, then it is a must! My husband and mother both ordered the duck entr\u00e9e and my father and I both ordered the signature dish, the piperad\u00e9. Everything just sang in our mouths and tummies. Maybe because the chef accidentally made an extra by mistake, maybe because our server truly was wonderful, regardless, without provocation, a dessert magically appeared before us on the house. It was the traditional Basque donuts and they were just perfect with our after dinner espressos. \u00a0This was the most memorable dinner during our trip to San Francisco.",

The ambiance is romantic yet comfortable for a group of kids that came with some grown-ups to celebrate a birthday. A beautiful, tasteful wine bottle chandelier hangs from the ceiling that does not scream \"look at me!\" the way so much restaurant lighting does. The exposed beams and dark wood floor exemplified the aesthetic of the rustic Spanish-Basque menu well.  The hubby and I decided to chance it and walked it without a reservation on a Saturday night. We were greeted at the door by a very nice hostess who offered us a table, even though she was saving it for a 730p reservation. Having exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes to dine, we didn't dillydally with our decisions. Our server and waitstaff didn't dillydally either as they gave us brisk, concise yet efficient service.   After taking our order, the bread, that was absolutely to die for came out. Complimented by the even more impressive olive oil, we had to stop ourselves from eating all the bread. I noticed no salt and pepper were available at the table, which I thought was a gutsy move that showed that Chef Hirigoyen really encouraged his customers to trust his flavoring. WIth no salt or pepper, we were also able to taste the wonderful olive oil in its true, barest state. Wow, I might never put salt in olive oil again.  We both ordered the garlic soup (on the 7X7 list) to start. The soup was indeed a simple yet complex clear-broth soup. My tastebuds were amazed to find how well seasoned the soup was given it's bare, yet simple home-cooked look. I concluded that I had never had anything like it. My hubby ordered the lamb chops and I had the seafood and shellfish stew. \u00a0Both dishes were excellent, well-portioned and presented, and left both of us with exactly enough room for a cup of coffee afterwards.  However, the clock read 730p as we both sopped up the last bits of sauce from our dishes with the two pieces of bread we wisely saved. We paid for our dinner and thanked the hostess for her kindness. No dessert but we were glad to have another reason to return as we walked out with warm, happy bellies.",

    "review_text": "My friend Tina celebrated her birthday here and I was part of the task force to find a restaurant that could handle a table for 12. Finding a restaurant that's open on a Monday and that can hold such a large group without charging a fixed price is almost impossible. I finally found the perfect restaurant, Piperade. Piperade gets MAJOR props for being so incredibly nice and accommodating. When I first made reservations, it was only going to be a group of 10. When I had to change the reservation to 12 people last minute, they were incredibly flexible. I even asked for a \"nicer\" table since we were celebrating Tina's birthday and they made sure to give us a gorgeous, round table at the center of the restaurant. Piperade is a smaller, intimate restaurant that serves Basque food, influenced by Spanish and French regions.  So I need to preface this review and mention that I was not feeling well at all during this meal. I was fighting a cold and was super congested. It affected my sense of taste. As a result, I think my food was less flavorful. Nonetheless, there were a couple of standout dishes at Piperade. I loved the calamari \"a la plancha\" and the piperade. The calamari was cooked very well (didn't have a tough, rubbery consistency) and I was loving the slightly tangy sauce on top. I had never had piperade before so I can't vouch for it's authenticity, but I can vouch for its tastiness! Piperade is a vegetarian stew with onions, green peppers and tomatoes and the restaurant topped it with bacon and a poached egg. It reminded me of ratatouille with a spicier kick. Out of all the desserts we tried, my favorite was the apple tart. The crust was flaky and buttery like a puff pastry and the apples and cream/custard were delightful. The caramel on top was the icing on the cake. I didn't want to share.  My dungeness crab txangurro had a healthy amount of crab in it, but it tasted a little bland. My cod was cooked well, but I kind of wish there was more sauce or a broth to bring the dish all together. The dish almost seemed too simple. The orange blossom beignets failed to impress me too. I'm not a big fan of floral-flavored things (I hate rose water and lavender) so the orange blossom was not my cup of tea. I also wished that the beignets were a little lighter and had a creamy sauce like a creme anglaise to dip it in. Oh man, Grand Marnier creme anglaise would have been a life-changing addition.  Overall, the ambiance was warm and inviting with wooden tables and really comfortable chairs. Seriously, those chairs were a lifesaver because I was feeling so uncomfortable otherwise. I would totally recommend Piperade if you're looking for a restaurant that can handle larger groups. And, parking is easy too! Glad we got to celebrate Tina's birthday in style!

Needless to say, I rarely eat there cause they charge like $18 dollars for a hard boiled egg. \u00a0But when I do decide to throw my money to the wind and my ass to the morbidly obese, the food is fantastic. \u00a0  Hard day today. \u00a0I just polished off a three million dollar salad with pecans, ripe avocado, mandarin orange slices, grilled chicken breast, slices of rich parmesan cheese and a lovely vinaigrette.  It was hard, but I stayed away from those sneaky snacker Greek Yogurt cups.  So this one time I walk in to get a snack, and they are out of the little hummus cups that I usually make mouth sex to. \u00a0I ask the counter lady when they might get some more. \u00a0She says she doesn't know and points me in the direction of the Greek Yogurt Cup. \u00a0I am like, sure. \u00a0Greek Yogurt. \u00a0Whatever. \u00a0I'll take it.  I get back to my desk, and sure enough I have been fucked royally. \u00a0The Greek Yogurt is the thickest most insanely delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0It's like eating a whole cup of sour cream.   2.5 seconds later, I need more. \u00a0That's right. \u00a0I got ANOTHER one. \u00a0All the while thinking, \"It's YOGURT! What harm can it possibly do?\", and also giving major props to Zeus or Aphrodite or Chlamydia for sprinkling some their big phat Greek wedding magic into healthy food to make it taste like straight butter covered butter.  You might have already come to the punch line of this stupid, tedious little story, but I'm blonde, so I'll take you all the way through the painful details.  Cut to Casa G****berg about a month later. \u00a0No wisdom teeth. \u00a0Moms asks me what I want to gum on.  Ummm, greek yogurt of course. \u00a0The most amazing, delicious, ridiculous shit ever.  So she brings it to me. \u00a0Sho nuff, it tastes different. \u00a0Not as thick. \u00a0Not as creamy. \u00a0Not as sour cream, buttery. \u00a0So I am like, \"WTF?\". \u00a0   Turns out what the lunch ladies have been shoveling in my yogurt hole weighs in at about 25 grams of fat and 300 calories per serving. \u00a0Can anyone say Big Mac? \u00a0Like, I could have been eating fried bananas covered in peanut butter and fudge sauce this WHOLE MOTHER FUCKING TIME? \u00a0  So, I came to work very enraged and wrote a little note for their suggestion box, that went a little something like this:  Dear Lunch People,   The greek yogurt is fantastic. \u00a0And why wouldn't it be? \u00a0IT'S MADE OF FAT. \u00a0CHUNKY, PEARLESCENT, WHITE FAT HARVESTED FROM GREEK BABIES.  YOU SUCK. \u00a0I HATE YOU.  - Rachel  PS. \u00a0Can you please think of adding a Vegetable Cup to the menu?",

Perfect with the glass of muscato gifted to me by the bartender.

I've always had issues with the menu items tasting like processed foods churned into charming brown-boxed goods: The orange cheese in their sandwiches is pretty much Velveeta; the Mr. Williams \"fried chicken\" looks and tastes like it came out of a supermarket freezer; mandarin oranges in a popular salad clearly come from a can. However, given the close proximity and the FRIENDLINESS/ sheer EXUBERANCE of the people there--seriously, what are they on?!--made me a regular customer, and hey, their sandwiches are decent enough.   Usually the wait is rather long, but today, they neglected my order completely. As I watched entire lines exhaust and dwindle down to the last stragglers, I inquired about my order. The buoyant cashier keeps referring to some other sandwich I did not order, but never mind that, because they never made a sandwich period! She talks to the guy manning the kitchen, and instead of taking care of my order from at least 20 customers ago, he fills incoming orders until he feels my order is fit enough for his time. In my opinion, he should've made me his priority customer instead of taking his sweet a$$ time.  Now, I mentioned service is usually slow, but slow meaning a total wait time of no more than 10 minutes of standing around the little window. Grilled cheese is no mad science, and half the cheese isn't even melted. I can see the beveled edges where they were sliced at the factory.  What irritated me further was how, of course, they handed me my sandwich unapologetically and with that HAPPINESS of theirs, and then I realized that they are not \"on\" anything...they are happy out of sheer ignorance!! If I had run this window, I would've not only made my order as quickly as possible, but I would've refunded my money. But nope! Instead they've lost a customer.",

    "review_text": "I understand service has been a major complaint about Piperade in the past, and perhaps it is an issue more at dinner if the restaurant is trying to turn the tables faster. But for lunch, service was unrushed and extremely pleasant. One the table for shared starters was a tartare of bacalao and oysters, a garlic soup, and a French onion soup. The garlic soup was easily the favorite, but I convinced everyone to leave some as I knew I wanted to take some home for a late-night snack. This was all consumed with a Tablas Creek Roussanne which worked quite well.  K chose as his entree lamb chops served with Manchego potato gratin and I opted for rarely-seen veal cheeks with fava beans and cepes. Our guest was dieting and opted for a butter lettuce salad. Both our entrees were astonishingly good but the veal cheeks, undoubtedly a sous vide preparation, melted in the mouth. We had as a second pairing a Guelbenzu blend that consisted of a cab-sauv/tempranillo blend which worked quite well.  Being a business meeting, more time was needed for negotiations and dessert was ordered... a cheese plate and port for K, a Gateau Basque for me, and our guest (then realizing how great the food was and foregoing the diet) ordered an apple tart. At one point during the discussion, I mentioned in passing to our guest that K and I were experimenting with making cheese but were struggling with finding goat's milk that is not ultra-pasteurized. While clearing plates and overhearing this remark, our server brought a large hunk of goat's milk cheese from Petaluma for us to try. It was a simple gesture, done without largesse and was well-appreciated.",

    "review_text": "Ever walk into a place and just feel all warm and cozy. That's the feeling I got when we walked into Piperade. It had the feeling of a place you would go with your grandparents when they visit and where all dishes should always be shared.   Is it cutting edge locavore cuisine? no. Is it cheap American comfort food? no. They don't list the farms they use, nor do they add on the SF health tax on afterwards to your bill instead everything is done with class and a manner that lets the history of the food speak for itself.  There were so many smaller plates that looked interesting that we decided to get lots of them and just split a larger plate. We both started with soups, my spouse got the soup of the day which was a pea soup unfortunatly she realized after it came and she tried it that it had bacon in it and had to return it as she doesn't eat land animals. They were nice about it and removed it from our bill. I had the garlic soup which was wonderful, it has the lovely bouquet of garlic while not being bitter or too strong, there was egg and croutons floating in the broth as well as perfectly cooked prawns.  Seafood is really where Piperade shines. All the seafood dishes were spot on in terms of cooking and seasoning. We had the calamari which my spouse really liked and I thought was pretty good. We both really enjoyed one of the vegetarian dishes which was a mushsroom pie which was so rich and creamy and the staff brought it out already cut in two and on two plates for us. I order the cold poached foie gras which was pricey at 20 dollars but when I saw the huge portions I understood why. This is a dish for 4 people to share. they brought out two huge torchons of foie gras with salt, pepper and quince compote. quince compote plus foie gras on toast is truly a marvelous thing. There was no way I could eat all the dish though and I brought one torchon home with me for midnight snacking.  The large entree we did share was basque stew of seafood with the wonderful pepper sauce that is used so often and it was all cooked beautifully. I really liked it while the French wife liked it but clearly since she has spent far more time eating Basque cooking at the source didn't find it so amazing.  We finished off the meal with a play on the Ferraro Rocher \u00a0with a dense chocolate mousse on top of a bed of hazelnut \"rocher\". It was one of many tempting desserts on the dessert menu and it was really lovely and one of the standouts of the evening.  The archicture may harkens back to a basque farmstead with rough brick walls, low timbered ceilings and distressed wood floors. What was lovely was how quite it was with an almost full dining room and how relaxed it felt.  There servers were almost all older men and our server was a nice uncle type who was present without being overbearing. With a spouse a with a mohawk and uniform of combat boots and cut off cargos I'm never quite sure how the service will be although usually in San Francisco we haven't had too many issues and this place followed that pattern with the staff being surprised but amused at her giant furry animal hat. The clientele does range from early 30 through older than they will admit.  It would be very easy to spend a 100 dollars on a meal for two but you could also spend around 45 for a meal for two. It's not a cheap restaurant yet everything was worth the price we paid.",

    "review_text": "I enjoy bocadillos quite a bit so I knew I'd like Piperade off the bat. \u00a0To begin with, our group shared these apps:  Calamari \"a la Plancha,\" Asian Pear, Mint Terrine of Warm Sheep's Milk Cheese + Ham Piquillo Peppers stuffed with \u00a0Goat Cheese, Pistachios and Raisins  Their apps and desserts are hands down the best part of the meal. \u00a0The calamari was grilled and refreshing, the terrine was UBER salty but so fatty that little bites were still foodgasmic, and the piquillo peppers were stuffed with heavenly creamy goat cheese. \u00a0Honestly, I wished I had ordered two more apps for myself as my entree. \u00a0Here were the reasons why I didn't like the entrees: \u00a0  - I thought the roast chicken was pretty boring, as well as the steamed rockfish. \u00a0I just wish there was a little more umph to it. \u00a0It was fine quality, but I like the rockfish I steam at home better (or perhaps its just I don't like the subtlety of the basque style fish/chicken?  -My husband's new york steak came out medium to medium well, which is truly upsetting when you expect a medium rare. \u00a0He had to sit there while we all ate and by the time he got his food back, he wasn't hungry. This definitely ruined it for him.   + On the plus side, my friend got the rack of lamb and he loved it. \u00a0We all agreed we should have gotten his dish instead.   For the desserts: * Dark Chocolate Cake \"Amatxi\" &amp; Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche * Milk Chocolate &amp; Hazelnut \"Biarritz Rocher\" * Orange Blossom Beignets  I loved the airy and chewy texture of the beignets, but felt they lacked something; whether it was a creme to dip in the beignets or more flavor in general. \u00a0I didn't like rocher, since the botttom crispy part had tasted like it was previously frozen, and maybe even had frost bite on it at one point. \u00a0Definitely the Dark Chocolate Cake was the winner, and I would be happy to get this every time.",

    "review_text": "Gora Euskadi! \u00a0Long live the Basque!  I am simply in love with Basque cuisine and this place was awesome. \u00a0Came here with Yelper Gloria C. and four other people and enjoyed a night of fine wine &amp; food. \u00a0I had never heard of this place before until someone in the group had suggested the place, and I'm glad we went there because the food was superb, exquisite, and most of all--TASTY.  Our party ordered and shared the following tapas, all of which were really good and tasty, and made we want to have more...but sadly, I could only get a little bite of each:  * Warm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine with aged sherry * Thinly sliced serrano ham * Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts, and gold raisins,  * Calamari a la plancha * Dungness crab with basil, roasted pepper, and mango * Endive salad with pomegranate seeds and persimmons  Of all the appetizers, my favorite was the warm sheep's milk cheese. \u00a0It was just so creamy and delicious. \u00a0It's definitely something you should try. \u00a0Probably my least favorite was the serrano ham, due to its simplicity. \u00a0I had made the choice to order it to share only because it's a staple in the Iberian diet (well, ham).  For the entrees, I ordered the \"Seared Filet Of Duck with braised romaine, cippolinis, cherries &amp; pork wine sauce\" which was very well done. \u00a0I had it done medium-rare (consistency of steak) since that's the best way to have game meat... if duck is cooked too well prepared, then the meat is dry and unpalatable. \u00a0 It was rich with flavor and the texture was great, and the romaine, small onions, and cherries complimented the complex flavors of the seared duck. \u00a0Absolutely delicious. \u00a0I had it paired with a Basque red wine, which I cannot remember the name, but they went together VERY well.  Lastly for dessert, we all ordered our own separate things, but I had the turron mousse cake with roasted almonds. \u00a0If you are a big fan of turron, what Spaniards and Italians have during the Christmas season, then you'll love this cake. It tasted like eating turron but in a soft, cake form...delicious. \u00a0It was paired with a glass of their sparkling moscato, which wasn't too sweet or too dry--so the two went together perfectly. \u00a0  If you look at the menu online, there aren't any prices listed.. usually that means $$$. \u00a0And with no exception, this place is actually kind of expensive. \u00a0Each of us ate about $60 or more worth of food... but it was well worth every penny. \u00a0This place is really cozy, so it's a definite great place to bring someone on a date to!",

Though arriving ten minutes early, the host seated us at a quite table on the side, as requested. The waiter came by and took our drink orders. \u00a0After bringing the drinks, we place our orders.  The bread basket consisted of tasty ACME bread with a delicious olive oil for dipping. \u00a0(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=B21lxoY9LatoGvz8VerGVw#B21lxoY9LatoGvz8VerGVw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pipe\u2026</a>)  Starter: Seasonal Mushroom Tartlet with thyme and garlic. \u00a0Nicely flavored mushrooms on a tart. \u00a0Delicious.  Entrees: Roasted Rack of Lamb with Merguez sausage, fennel, cumin and date relish. \u00a0The lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare and was nicely browned on the outside. \u00a0The lamb and the Merguez sausage went well with the date relish. Dish also included some cut pieces of potatoes and a fennel bulb, which I initially thought was an onion. \u00a0(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=B21lxoY9LatoGvz8VerGVw#C7KerDnykgDEK-uZxdOp7g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pipe\u2026</a>)  New York Steak with Romesco, broccoli rabe, garlic, Ossau-Iraty. \u00a0Steak had a nice sear and was perfectly cooked medium rare. \u00a0It went well with the Romesco sauce. \u00a0The entr\u00e9e had broccoli rabe as a veggie, but it was lacking something. \u00a0Oh, a starch. \u00a0Maybe they forgot to put some potatoes on the dish. \u00a0It would have rounded out the dish.

But strangely enough, it was now that I would only truly discover and appreciate what the food is about. I've recently returned from Spain and spent a significant time in the Basque country which is where the chef and our server hailed. Now unfortunately the many dishes that I really loved just arent available here as the nature of seafood,produce, etc are just too wildly different. However we still found many things to be attractive and went as follows:  -Warm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine with aged sherry -Calamari a la plancha with fennel, olive, caper and coriander salpicon -Cold poached foie gras with black pepper, sea salt and apple compote -Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts, and golden raisins -Lamb basquaise chops with gigante beans and zikiro vinaigrette -Gateau basque with cherry preserves  They were out of the Axoa special and they didnt have things like pil-pil, caillos, kokotxa, txipirones, or bacalao/hake which I was really looking forward to, but all the familiar basque flavors were there. I had ordered a glass of Txakoli which kind of perked our servers attention. As we spoke further I found out that she was from a village outside of Lasarte which houses one of the most famous Basque restaurants Martin Berasategui. I then started talking about all the places throughout San Sebastian/Donostia \u00a0that I had been and she said I made her homesick! It was very cool to be able to relate to someone who grew up on the other side of the world. I always say that the easiest way to be accepted by another's culture is to eat their food and it sure held true here. At the end of our meal I was asking about dessert wines and was offered some complementary Patxaran, which is a specific Basque digestif. The same thing happened to me at Arzak in San Sebastian. It's true the hospitality of the Basque people! They are so damn friendly!  In normal form, we closed the place down and I'm excited to go back. I now have a Basque connection and I'm going to lobby for some of those dishes that opened my eyes to the Euskadi cuisine . 4.5 stars  Fuerte!",

Me and my wife celebrated our 2nd anniversary here. We started off with the mussels, cheeses, and tuna \"Marmitako\". All three of them sucked ass. The mussels were not fresh, and the cheeses were just okay. The seared tuna... I've had better. However, we ordered the Lamb chops and Manchego Potato Gratin... it's like OMG redemption. The main meal was awesome. However we tried finishing the night with some desserts, chocolate rochert and apple tart... and again, meh. I really want to rate this place higher than 2 1/2 starts but being that it is overrated and overpriced, I don't think I'm gonna come back anytime soon.",

That said a lot to me.   Just to have full disclosure - I had heard of this place before because a co-worker of mine used to work there, but I think the reason the chef came out to talk to us was because the table had Dslr cameras and he may have thought we were there to review his restaurant.   This was my first time having Basque wine and i was very much blown away.   I would definitely go back for a special occasion.",

For desert, we had the chocolate cake. \u00a0It was fairly standard and forgettable. \u00a0However, for some reason they kept trying to give us the beignets which we didn't order. \u00a0We sent them back once, but since they were closing, they just decided to give it to us. \u00a0They were sooooo good. \u00a0Not New Orleans good, but REALLY good still.  Aside from the bartender, the service was average to above average. \u00a0Not enthusiastic by any stretch of the imagination, but polite, prompt and wasn't intrusive. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place for semi-romantic dates or group dates. \u00a0It is a bit pricey (about $50 each with a bottle of wine, but not included other drinks).",

As we were seated, we received water and warm, crusty bread. \u00a0Service was spectacular. \u00a0Our server was very knowledgeable, picked up on the nuances of each of her guests, helped with indecision and was thoroughly effective in her role. \u00a0Two out of four of us ordered specialty cocktails and they were delicious. \u00a0The other two martinis were perfectly prepared. \u00a0We ordered appetizers, salads, soup, and two entrees to share. \u00a0One entree was the salmon, and it was heavenly. \u00a0The other was a steak dish and, again, out of this world. \u00a0We had a garlic soup that was very yummy, but the soup of the day (although I cannot remember what it was) amazed us! \u00a0  The wine list is diverse and interesting, and we were assisted with selecting a Malbec (from Argentina) that was fantastic and extremely reasonably priced. \u00a0We followed up with a couple of glasses of Spanish Tempranillo that was superb.  Dessert was fantastic as well - we ordered a flourless chocolate cake to share, but our server also brought out a sumptious fruit tart as a bonus.  It was such a pleasurable experience - fresh ingredients, beautifully prepared, and great ambiance. \u00a0We'll be back.",

    "review_text": "I always think of Piperade as a nice hidden gem. Close to a lot, yet on its own quiet litle street. Romantic, lively but not noisy, but a little overpriced.  THE COST We got a TravelZoo deal: $79 for 2 glasses of wine, 2 starters, 2 entrees, &amp; 2 desserts. It was worth it, though I would've found it a little much at full price ($148 value).  SERVICE The hostess was great: friendly, came around often to fill water &amp; other little things. Our server, however, didn't show up at our table for a good 10 minutes, even after we were looking around the restaurant quite obviously. He acted a little too suave &amp; could've been more apologetic about (or even just acknowledged) ignoring us for so long. He did let me upgrade my glass of wine (part of our TravelZoo deal) to a cocktail for free.

My bf usually doesn't like the cocktails I get but was floored by this one.

It was thick, had a wafer-like crunch to it, but was a little more dense than you'd imagine. This perfect crisp when you chewed into it, coupled with a burst of flavor, made this fantastic.  * Yogurt Cake, Honey, Apricots ($9) - 4 stars pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=HXkzPVUZulffieOfbHIIqA#HXkzPVUZulffieOfbHIIqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pipe\u2026</a> This was good to balance with the intense chocolate dessert above.

Some of us ordered the NY steak (scrumptious and rare to the touch!), some ordered the duck filet...i don't usually like eating duck but this was very tender and tasty and a couple ordered the lamb and i was in heaven! i DON'T like lamb at all, the after taste usually forces me to gag (but) a few years back at GDanko i tried their lamb and was in-luv. That same feeling surfaced this evening for me, at Piperade. i was so happy....Maybe i am ready to venture out.

We began with the Dungeness Crab \"Txangurro,\" which was light and flavorful, and paired very nicely with the Beef Crudo. The Fingerling chips with the crudo were a really nice touch. I chose the Alaskan Halibut for my meal. It was perfect cooked, seasoned beautifully and the roasted corn relish added a great dimension. Meanwhile, the green and yellow zucchini medley that supported it left me pleasantly surprised by its grilled flavor and nothing like the soggy mess that often characterizes zucchini dishes.  We finished off the meal by splitting the orange blossom beignets (which were good - but I would have like a little more of the orange flavor to come through) and the \"Milk Chocolate &amp; Hazelnut 'Biarritz Rocher'\", which pleasantly surprised me. The waitress described as something like a Ferrero Rocher concoction, whereas this was a delicious mousse-like centerpiece, on top of a crumbly and crusty chocolate base.

She quickly ordered a bottle of their red, a Spanish 2008 El Chapparal, de Vega Garnacia. It was a light bodied red with full flavor. It really went well with our meal which consisted of the following:  -Calamari a la plancha (TASTY)  -Butter lettuce salad   -Manchego gratin  -Steamed rockfish with a garlic vinagerette and spinach (STELLAR)   Because our server found us quite the \"charmers,\" he brought two glasses of dessert moscato, on the house to go with our Milk Chocolate and Hazelnut Biarritz \"Rocher\" dessert for our finale.

Fortunately for the diner, Piperade has a lot more going on than the unfortunate street upon which it sits. \u00a0If you have weekdays off and don't feel compelled to eat at 11 in the morning, you can walk in to what is essentially your own private restaurant, sharing a large space with only a few other people. \u00a0The setting is of a recent modernism aging to classic---clearly not cutting edge, but not dated, either. \u00a0Nice, warm, yet elegant.  We confined ourselves to small plates, sharing the piquillo peppers; \u00a0calamari a la plancha; \u00a0Dungeness crab txangurro; \u00a0and the beans gigante---the menu changes daily and I notice that today it's mussels a la plancha and no beans gigante, with other stuff added that wasn't on the menu the day we dropped in.  Everything was well prepared, tasty, well presented. \u00a0There were no \"Wow!\" moments of culinary discovery, or bliss, but if we had a complaint, it never found words to express itself.  The hands-down favorite was the Dungeness crab, in a simple preparation that allowed the sweet marine flavor and silky texture of the crab to shine through, with added tropical notes, and a light crunch from the fresh, julienned escarole that topped the dish. \u00a0The grilled calamari (a la plancha=grilled) was basically the cone and tentacles of baby squid separated but cooked otherwise intact. \u00a0Fresh, soft, and slightly smoky, this is a far cry from the fried variety I love, and I didn't care. \u00a0Seafood polyamory! \u00a0It's San Francisco! \u00a0The beans gigante were O.K.; \u00a0a cold preparation as I remember, with a small number of the big flat beans beneath what looked like slices of pickled herring (a delicate white fish, in any case), but tasted better. \u00a0Not the most impressive dish that day, but still decent. \u00a0The piquillo peppers were the Basque equivalent of Mac n Cheese: \u00a0You'd be a real sour puss not to like something with this much goat cheese stuffed into it. \u00a0The flavor burst of the creamy cheese preparation were an hard to resist delight.  The lunch ended with the dark chocolate cake amaxti with creme fraiche; \u00a0a near molten (and very warm) chocolate \u00a0cake cooled by a generous dollop of the creme fraiche, which also tempered the bitter of the chocolate itself. \u00a0 The espressos coming out ahead of the cake, to be mostly consumed by the time it arrived, was the only gaffe in service we experienced.  Portions are not generous but appropriate for this level of dining establishment and I'd heartily recommend eating here.",

The onion tart was delious as well as the mussell salad. @Danielle W, I agree, it's not a suitable for girls night out, it's very conservative, you can actually hear what your partner is saying. It's a lovely relief from the crazy trendy packed restaurants in NYC that I've been dealing with for the last 4 years. Go there to eat great food, enjoy the tasteful decor and enjoy the company that you keep. It's a great date night place as well as champagne on the patio. Enjoy but don't go crazy....",

    "review_text": "As my own private protest of John Burton's absurd bill proposing a ban on the production and sale of foie gras in the State of California, I made it a point to order the \"artisan foie gras sauted with Monterey squid, grapes and verjus.\" And it was good, so fuck you, John Burton. You can go cram your anti-duck-gullet-cramming bill down someone else's gullet, because mine was full of rich, buttery, seared foie gras. The grapes were a nice touch in lieu of a more traditional fruit accompaniment and the calamari was wonderul -- \"it's like two appetizers in one,\" said S. Three, if you want to count the verjus, which actually sat up and asked us to sop it up with bread.  We also got the \"bacalao fritters,\" which were my attempt to dull the pain of not seeing a brandade on the menu. Bad idea. Even though bacalao is fun as all get out, it's probably too dry and fibrous to be successfully batter-fried. Or maybe not. It seemed like they were aiming for a hush puppies batter-fried style and I generally don't like hush puppies.  In terms of main courses, I got the \"pork daube with fall vegetable ragout\": soft, thick chunks of braised pork with vegetables I actually really enjoyed -- they tasted as if they had been stewed along with the pork. Hearty and decidedly unfancy, but I'm always a sucker for braised meats.  Bemoaning that we were there on the wrong night for the rabbit special, S. went with that night's special, which was a veal \"stew\" composed of veal that she described as \"like butter,\" served with potatoes and some other mish-mash that I didn't pay much attention to, as I was too busy marvelling at how the veal was so soft and buttery, I literally didn't have to chew it. It was a masticatory revolution.  Dessert was a flan-ish custard with a more substantial texture that reminded me of pumpkin pie. Also, a little pile of orange-blossom-flavored beignets. I'm not sure how they did it, but the beignets were so orange-blossomy that I didn't miss the fact that they were served with nothing but a sprinkling of powdered sugar. The only problem was that they got way too soft way too quickly, so we decided that the best thing to do was to stuff the beignets with the custard. Kind of odd, kind of fun, and rather good.",

The employees are super chill and friendly. There's only two manning the small counter so usually there is a little wait line wise and food wise.  Most of their sandwiches are 7-9 bucks and come with a little side salad which is not a bad deal considering everything I've had so far has been tasty.  My favorite has been the Mr.Williams sandwich, probably because it contains delicious fried chicken. I also really enjoy the bread they use because it's a little firmer than usual in a good way and gives the sandwich great texture. The turkey and brie make for a good flavor combo and uses the same yummy bread. Banh mi was just ok, not as good as the other two.  Will definitely be back, next up, curry salad!",

BF, Alex is from France so selected a very nice Pouilly Fuisse to accompany our Calamari \"a la Plancha.\" Deliciously spiced. Then on to the Warm Sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine--perfectly crisped on the outside and wonderfully rich in flavor. We opened an old French wine that we brought which gradually opened up into a lovely wine with a lot of family memories. The young woman waiting on us was very sweet and fun, jousting in French with Alex. She recommended the Mushroom tarte and we also got the cold, poached Foie Gras. The tarte was savory with a great pastry crust and the Foie Gras was creamy and melt in your mouth good (not a crumb was left of either). We asked Chef/Owner Gerald Hirigoyen to recommend a wine to go with our main dishes. He chose a Temperanillo from Lodi which was big and fruity, but not overwhelming for the dishes we had. The guys had the Lamb-which comes with just right pink inside lamb chops, lamb sausage and whatever else there was I never found out as their plates were clean by the time I looked up from my Piperade! We whiled away the hours, talking, savoring the wine and enjoying a day when work and hectic schedules were forgotten for awhile. Eventually, we were the only patrons, but were not hurried or made to feel like we should leave. Got around to dessert and decided on Beignets and coffee. The pleasant atmosphere and the chance for a leisurely lunch was such a gift for all of us, we left re-connected with each other and happily full.",

Not considering the hype, this is a good place with a nice rustic ambiance, feels very warm and inviting, although at times it's down right cold and dark on those dreary winter days. The food is good, but there's certainly inconsistency as another reviewer mentions. Sometimes the same dish is too salty, sometimes not at all. I don't feel the Basque flavors come through the way they should. Perhaps it's our produce? To me, it's more like eating good California cuisine with a Basque theme. What really is 4 stars about this place is the desserts. Their orange blossom beignets are awesome!  You can often find the exec chef greeting patrons. In fact you're more likely to see him outside the kitchen than inside. Prices are high, even for lunch, and even if you want a sandwich you have to get extra sides, which are pricey, but very very good (especially the fries). Their MR Williams is a classic Chicken Avocado sandwich which is done really well.  ------ Piperade to-go is the little to-go window open at lunchtime at Williams Sonoma Corp building. It offers some good lunch options such as sandwiches and soups (they also have Mr Williams here). Their sandwiches are a little cheaper than what you pay in the restaurant, but the quality is also worse, although some would reason that it's still better than getting something for the same price as the deli. It seems they sometimes use the restaurants leftovers for the to-go boxes, especially for the side salad. Once there were fruit flies in the mixed greens that came with the sandwich. Gross. They do have some yummy cookies, yogurt &amp; honey, spring rolls, fancy sodas, available at the to-go window. The line gets really long right at lunch, so get there early.",

I hate when servers interrupt during a good conversation, so I was glad that he knew when to interrupt &amp; when to walk away.  As soon as we finished, I let the hostess know we were ready to take our seats (had reserved seating through opentable).  Dinner was... unbelievable! Their bread is so crunchy on the outside &amp; soft &amp; firm on the inside. We ate all the bread w/ that very olive-y olive oil dip! Loved! For entrees, my friend chose the Roasted Salmon &amp; I picked the Duck breast per the waiter's recommendation. I was hesitant to try duck because it could go so right or more commonly.. so wrong. This duck.. did not disappoint! Ordered medium rare &amp; pretty much licked the sauce off the plate! That sauce w/ that perfectly crispy skin &amp; moist breast paired so perfectly! The salmon was just as good! I believe it was breaded in a tomato-y sauce, not that it tasted like tomato. But believe me.. must try! Btw thank you waiter (sry forgot his name)!   Overall, good ambiance, good conversation &amp; company, good food &amp; good wine. What could be better? Dinner cost about $220 including tax &amp; tip for the two of us... so come with an open wallet &amp; an even bigger appetite!",

The cheese was good, but the serrano ham was not as flavorful as I had remembered. \u00a0We got a smattering of main plates among us -- the arctic char (tasted a bit fishy, according to my friend), the piperade (ok, but the entire dish seemed under-seasoned), the tuna sandwich and the snapper. None of the dishes seemed very inspired, and we all left less-than-impressed. \u00a0Sigh. Maybe I'll wait a few years before giving this place another shot.",

The Piperade To-Go Cafe has a specific name, but I coudn't find it anywhere on Yelp or Google. It's basically a little window in the back of Piperade that faces the alley between Battery and Green - called \"Icehouse Alley.\" Look for all the Williams-Sonoma employees unloading boxes and you're getting closer.  Their sandwiches and salads are a bit pricey for what they are, but they are damn good. The cafe just introduced a new sandwich that I seriously can't get enough of - the Black &amp; Blue: steak, onions, and blue cheese grilled panini-style with a side of salad.  Any of their paninis are good (grilled cheese, roasted pork) and their quesadillas are surprisingly flavorful and filling, but a little messy.   Unlike other Yelpers, I've never had any issues with rudeness. They recently made an \"order line\" and \"pay line\" to curb confusion during the lunch rush, which is helpful.  And for those complaining about running out of food - they are a small cafe. I'm glad they don't over order and throw out good food. Go early if you're worried about them not having what you want.",

We asked for a recommendation and be combed the menu with us to find one in our price range (don't you think I could do that myself...?). We ordered the cheese plate, which was delicious. \u00a0Only problem is that they insisted on using the table bread with it. No crackers or anything with complimentary flavor a (there was dig jam on the board). Wine was exceptional, through no help of the staff...   We ordered the red snapper and NY strip. Both were absolutely out of the this world. Honestly, the red snapper may have been the best tasting fish I've ever had. Steak was cooked well, little overcooked for me liking, but I was too busy eating off my girlfriends plate to take notice.  One more thing, the waiter never once came over to table the entire time we were eating to check on us. He didn't bring the food, didn't pour the bottle of wine, didn't even ask how the food was. \u00a0He gave short, again, bordering on rude responses.

We also wanted to go on a Spanish food hiatus in advance of our trip to Spain (lunch at El Bulli) in August. \u00a0This place seemed like it would offer up a great last meal, and they did not disappoint. \u00a0I'm more accustomed to tapas, so the bulk of the menu was uncharted territory for me. \u00a0Strap in for the post-mortem on our meal.  The table started with the cold foie gras. \u00a0It was served with salt, pepper and a compote of fruit (quince?). \u00a0This is a simple but delicious dish that wouldn't be well served by a more complicated preparation.  My wife had the piperade, a thick soup akin to French Onion Soup, but based on red peppers. \u00a0 There's also some serrano ham &amp; perfectly poached egg thrown in for good measure, and it is, again, simple but delicious. I had the Thursday special which was a confit of duck leg served over green lentils. \u00a0Again, this is a simple dish that is as rich and textured as you would want it to be without obscuring the umami.  The table also shared an order of fries that I regretted ordering as they were not done to my taste. \u00a0They were cut larger than I prefer and rather bland. \u00a0We also shared 2 desserts, but they were unremarkable.  The service was fine - nothing stood out good or bad. \u00a0In hindsight, I think that this is probably a very good thing. \u00a0The wine list is impressive. \u00a0We frequent a number of tapas places in the city and I know most of the reds that are in the rotation. \u00a0Piperade didn't have any of the usual suspects and it was fun to get acquainted with something new.

They had a small menu, but everything on it looked great! \u00a0I decided to go with the Veal which was delicious. \u00a0It was very tender and just melted in my mouth. \u00a0I'll have to come back to try the other dishes like the duck, and sea bass. \u00a0I did get a chance to try some of the garlic soup and rock shrimp. \u00a0I liked it, but it didn't really wow me. \u00a0It was unique and I could see why it would be on the 7x7 list. \u00a0I don't know if I would order it on my own, but I'm glad I tried it.

The ambiance is very quaint and romantic. I love the small, intimate atmosphere that is evident as soon as you walk in. The food overall was above average in my opinion with the Piperade, Lamp Chop, Steak and Pork Tenderloin being the big hits at the table. The wine selection was below average with very few California wines being represented on the menu. I understand this is Basque cuisine so the importance of representing European wines is not being understated in this review, but being that we are less than an hour away from Napa/ Sonoma I would have liked to have seen a better selection of local wines. There are very few Wines By the Glass options available.   The big negatives for all of us were the sea food dishes. Each was very 'fishy' and the Bacalao was the most 'unique' of them all. It's undoubtedly an acquired taste and none of us were too enthused after the first bite. By the same token the Halibut, Red Snapper and Crab salad very similar to the Bacalao in terms of them being rather 'fishy' in smell and taste  The dessert selections were okay - the Cheese Yogurt is unique and worth a try if you're open to trying a more tart/sour dessert versus your traditional chocolate cake type ending.  The last comment is that as one of the last tables to finish our meal it was clear the folks at Piperade were ready to see us leave. They 'hovered' for the last 30 minutes of our meal and that was most infuriating.....irritating....and surprising.....  All in all 3 stars.....for 5 people the tab was around 400 bucks not including tip.....",

Ambiance: The restaurant itself is a very nice, large space but it's located in a very non-descript area of the city. \u00a0This is totally fine with me, as long as the experience is good. \u00a0The patrons were all noticeably older. \u00a0In our mid-thirties, I think we were by far the youngest people in the restaurant! \u00a0As others have mentioned on Yelp, you are sitting very close to other tables so it's hard to not to eavesdrop on people's conversations.  Food: \u00a0for appetizers we ordered the grilled calamari and the Serrano ham, which were both quite tasty. \u00a0The Serrano ham was very overpriced though, considering how much you get. \u00a0The grilled calamari was probably my favorite part of the dinner, very tender and perfectly seasoned. \u00a0For entrees we split the Cornish game hen and the New York steak. \u00a0The Cornish game hen was good, but the New York steak was even better! \u00a0The steak was perfectly cooked medium-rare and came with a yummy sauce for dipping. \u00a0Since we got two appetizers we didn't order dessert.

Once the waiter noticed he did apologize and our appetizers eventually came. \u00a0We had to ask for our waters to be refilled and I also had to ask for another glass of wine, which was a bit annoying (even more so because I was starving and irritated from waiting). \u00a0Our waiter was nice enough to comp my second glass of wine because of the wait, which was a nice touch.  Overall, the food was pretty good but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon unless there's another Bloomspot deal because it's not worth their price point when there are so many other restaurants to choose from in the city.",

    "review_text": "Not sure if our service experience was because we came with a Bloomspot coupon, but I and my friend felt we were being rushed through our meal. The busboy hovered to take away our plate almost before we had taken the last bite, and the head waiter/maitre d' was brusque and as soon as the dessert plates were cleared asked us if he could get any thing else for us. My companion is from Spain and she was offended by this treatment--it's not like we lingered for hours over our courses!  The food was satisfactory but far from exciting, although well-cooked. In particular I found the seafood stew bland.  Our server was delightful-- too bad the others had to wreck the effect of her charming care of us.  One odd note--the lamb dish was served in two rib chops, and no carving/steak knife provided! My friend was complaining of sore fingers from pressing the very slightly serrated dinner knife through the meat to cut it.",

    "review_text": "Gateau Basque- #10 on the 2013 7x7 100 Things to Eat Before You Die list.  Piperade is on SF Gate's 2012 100 Best Restaurants list, and also had a dish on the 7x7 list, so I was happy to finally dine here and be able to multi-task lists. Sweetening the deal was my Bloomspot for a 3 courses for 2 (1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert). I called to make reservations a week ahead of time and had no problems, but we did have an early dinner (5:30pm) since we were meeting up with friends after. We arrived a little early, and saw that they were allowing patrons in before they technically opened at 5:30pm. We were greeted at the door by the host, and sat promptly. Our server was very attentive and came over right away. We ordered:  -Calamari \"a la Plancha\" (Fennel, Olive, Caper, Coriander, Lemon, $15, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pipe\u2026</a>): Good. The calamari was cooked very well, and they very nicely split the plate without us asking. Although, I felt the olives and capers overpowered the subtle taste of the calamari a bit, I would still recommend this dish. -Veal Cheeks (Roasted Red Peppers, Fingerling Potatoes, $29, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#sne9CJ87yEziFM7M2TIYlQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pipe\u2026</a>): The veal cheeks were fork tender, but the dish overall was very bland! They definitely need to add more salt/seasoning, since it was hard to eat the tasteless red peppers and potatoes. This dish was also too watery for my liking, and I'm not sure I would order it again. -New York Steak (Romesco, Broccoli Rabe, Garlic, Ossau-Iraty, $32, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#Q_zAwzRySo-At4j0AfLSiw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pipe\u2026</a>): The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and I loved the sear on the steak. However, the NY cut was too lean for my preference, and it got a little boring to chew after a while, even with the romesco sauce. My favorite part of the meal was actually the broccoli rabe that accompanied this dish, since it was topped with shaved parmesan pieces. -G\u00e2teau Basque (Cherry Preserves, $9, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/piperade-san-francisco?select=hkCrWTX-aPee07XTHMFi4g#zxBcqT2sxr48omcfufRR1w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pipe\u2026</a>): Eh.. just ok. The custard filling was good, but the crust of the basque was too dry. I liked the version I had at a bakery in Portland a lot more. This version wasn't worth the $9- Skip!  I mostly enjoyed my dinner at Piperade, but I'm glad I had my Bloomspot deal, and am not sure I would return and pay full price for a meal here. The ingredients seemed quality and were cooked well, and they gave you a good sized portion, but I just didn't love any of the dishes for some reason. For the prices, I would rather dine at a number of nearby restaurants in the Financial District where I've had tastier food. I agree with Marisa G. that the other diners were considerably older (I'm in my late twenties), and it seems like they have a lot of regulars. At least the service was attentive, and our server made sure the pace of our meal was pretty brisk since we had to head out. Parking was easy to find since we came early, but there is a good amount of street parking spots available around this area.",

Going into entrees, since we normally don't have meat at the house, the NY steak was WOW. med-rare, perfect, caramelized shallots, scrumptious. everyone got a little piece and raved about it. For the table we got the side of fries, which had to have been deep fried in beef fat, you seriously couldn't get enough! And to the even MORE amazing parts of dinner...DESSERT. *insert drool here*. we needed to try alot, so we ordered eight different ones and just shared. too much to write every single one, but hands down, my favorite ended up being the Gateau Basque with cherry preserve! i tasted heaven and it was great.",

But either way the servers were attentive and very very helpful when making decisions about the menu.   For appetizers we tried the calamari, peppers, and terrine. The terrine was my favorite of the three because even though it was on the salty side the flavor was delicious and the crispy texture and savory flavor paired well with the bed of julienned green apple. The calamari pieces were very sour and chewy and not really to my liking. The peppers were tasty though, with goat cheese oozing out of the grilled piquillo peppers.  For the main course I chose the strip steak with shallots, thick sliced potatoes, and portobello mushrooms. The steak was DELICIOUS. Perfectly cooked medium and juicy. Definitely my favorite compared to the lamb chops (though also very flavorful) and steamed pacific snapper. A very solid steak dish.  And of course we had to try the beignets for dessert! These were orange blossom flavored so they had a light floral taste that wasn't too overpowering. YUM.",

I spent many summers in the south west coast of France(Hossegor/ Biarritz)..Basque country and all I ate was roast chickens, tomatoes, peppers, pomme frites AND that freakin to die for amazing cake/tart..  here's the kicker. One of our dinner guests looked at the cake when it was dropped and said \"boy, wouldn't it be nice to have 6 cherries on the plate for all of us?\" and nothing out of disappointment mind you.  The waitress over heard her and VOILA! a second slice arrived with.. oh yes, 6 cherries.  A french laundry experience for sure. maybe a bit messy because we shared and not with all the fan fare- an amazing array of flavors and textures for a fraction of the cost! great value!!  only suggestion is to maybe skip the crab and mussel salad. a little flat- the service was tops!",

Tipiaks (small plates) ordered: Calamari a la plancha with fennel olive, caper and coriander: whole small calamari grilled, the dish was very pretty but lacked some seasoning. The calamari was cooked perfectly.  Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts and golden raisins: very good, balanced flavors, beautiful dish  Fois gras with black pepper, salt and pineapple compote: creamy and went well with the pineapple compote  Open face mushroom pie: crowd favorite of the night. It was scrumptious on a lovely puff pastry with herbs and chantrelles. All three of us loved this dish.  Also ordered: Mushroom and leek soup: it was nothing to really write about, again lacked some depth and seasoning.  Garlic soup with rock shrimp, egg, bacon and bread: this was very interesting and very good. Broth like soup that was not overpowering in flavor. There was no skimping on the shirmp or egg or bacon for that matter in this dish. Absolutely recommended.  Dessert: Touron mouse cake with roasted almonds: the mousse was light and fluffy and the almonds were candided wtih nice crunch and sweetness. This dish actually reminded us of a bowl of Frosted flakes from a taste aspect. Different. Good.  Drinks: Cava sparkling wine: yummy  Cockails from their cocktail list: Jasmine infused vodka martini: Very good, like a lemon drop with out the sour and not overly sweet  Margarita:Not impressed, my friend actually didnt finish it and switched over to the Martini  Staff: friendly and attentive.Also had a cab waiting for us by the time our check arrived.  Overall, its a nice quiet atmosphere, romantic setting if \u00a0you are looking for a date night. It was good but the food wasn't memorable.",

Have tired of the newer SF restaurants with great food, but are so noisy it's hard to have a conversation.  Service - Excellent, there when needed, unobtrusive, good menu info. Seated on time. Vibe - D\u00e9cor open, inviting, not stuffy. Everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves. Mixed age crowd, on the older side, with some 20's-30s. Probably in part due to cost. Our 24 and 27 year old sons who live in SF loved it and commented on how calm Piperade felt. And yes, we could hear one another, but not \u00a0conversations from other tables. Price - Higher, but worth it.  Food - Consistently excellent. Bread - fresh from Acme, yum. Dungeness Crab Tangurro and another appetizer with ham was delectable, though that portion seemed small. Cornish Hen - moist, flavorful. Seafood &amp; Shellfish Stew - excellent, wasn't sure about the mussels' texture/maybe because was the first time had them. Pacific Snapper with spinach - so light seemed to melt in your mouth (good!). New York Steak - tender, just right. Dark chocolate cake with cr\u00e8me fraiche - one bite and everyone dove in for more, delicious. Parking - Easy street parking at no charge, because business people gone for the day. Reservations - Uses SeatMe, not Open Table, so you won't get OT points. Doesn't matter.",

    "review_text": "This place is great! \u00a0   Matthew L. and I came here with four other people to enjoy an \"all-out no turning back night full of deliciousness\" sort of meal. \u00a0 I felt like I could reward myself with a night out and I was ready to eat up a storm and not feel guilty about overdoing it.   I believe that first impressions are important and I loved this place from the start. \u00a0It's tucked away on a corner, subtle but classy. \u00a0I was looking forward to trying Basque food.  Matt and I were fashionably early and the waiters offered us a seat at the bar. \u00a0The bartender didn't glare at us when we both just asked for waters.   Eventually, the rest of our party arrived and we proceeded to our table and started admiring the menu. :) \u00a0This is what we ended up trying:  Tipiak small plates:  Dungeness crab with basil, roasted pepper and mango Warm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine Calamari \"a la plancha\" Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts and golden raisins Thinly sliced serrano ham Endive salad with pomegranate seeds and persimmon   For big plates, I ordered the braised seafood and shellfish stew in red pepper sauce. \u00a0My dining companions tried the lamb chop, roast duck, sea bass and another fish dish that I can't remember the name of now. \u00a0I loved the stew that I had. \u00a0For the price, I felt like it was very worth it. \u00a0The portion was perfect and the sauce that coated all the seafood was really flavorful.   Their menu has seasonal features so if you go on the website, you won't always be able to see the full selection of what they currently have.  On top of all the food (Hey, I said all-out-no turning back right?), we started the night off with two bottles of Basque wine at the recommendation of our server. \u00a0Both of the wines were wonderful. \u00a0We tried one white, one red. \u00a0The white wine was really fantastic. \u00a0It was on the dry side, very light and refreshing, with a taste of apple mixed in. \u00a0I'm by no means a wine expert so this is just what my elementary palate remembers from last night.   Out of all the small plates, my favorite was the piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and the calamari. \u00a0Both were really well done and I'd definitely get them again. \u00a0For some reason, the sheep's milk ham and cheese terrine didn't leave a big impression on me but if you go there, you should still try it.  Oh! I almost forgot about the desserts!!! \u00a0I had the cornmeal cake with strawberry compote and creme fraiche and also tried some of the orange blossom beignet as well as the kefir cheese yogurt with seasonal berries and honey. \u00a0I also tried a glass of their moscato to go along with dessert. \u00a0 The cornmeal cake was a bit dry and hard. \u00a0Not sure if that is how Basque cornmeal cake is supposed to be, but it was worth a try, although I don't think I would get it again. The orange blossom beignets were delicious though.  If you're ever looking for an intimate classy restaurant to enjoy a night of great food (and spend some $$) , Piperade is the place to go!",

Anyhoo, Piperade.  Piperade is consistently interesting. \u00a0Unless you have been here 10 times and order the same thing every time, you will be sure to explore new regions of your palate. \u00a0  The bacaloa (salted cod) was excellent. \u00a0Presented as a thin falayed layer of sushi grade fish topped with a backbone of shucked gooey oysters and drizzled lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche, I was in heaven, but the man wasn't really having it. \u00a0As he pulled a face, his words were \"I just ate the ocean.\"  I let him finish the haricot vert salad while I OGed over the bacaloa. \u00a0The salad was extraordinary (in the literal sense) as they used herbs I had never seen paired with green beans. \u00a0For example, the chef added mint to the otherwise earthy flavor that was such a nice surprise and worked cleanly with the walnuts. \u00a0It was subtle and clean. Save some bread to mop up the morsels left over after the green beans are gone; they are not to be wasted.  I took fellow yelper's suggestions to forgo the big plates and stick to the small dishes and I am glad I did. \u00a0Therefore the calamari came next, which was not like any calamari I have ever had... Again the Piperade surprise. \u00a0As far as I could tell, the calamari was only cooked in the sauce. \u00a0There was no crunch because there was no breading, no deep frying or pan frying. \u00a0This was calamari you would find in a sushi restaurant; fresh and chewy. \u00a0The sauce was fantastic, but very different...spicy with fennel and coriander and salty with capers... It was really flavorful but didn't take away from the calamari. \u00a0I enjoyed the dish but was left wanting a more substantial consistency to the calamari.  And then my favorite: the peppers stuffed with goat cheese. \u00a0God I love this dish. \u00a0If you love a really fresh goat cheese, please do yourself a favor and order this. \u00a0Perfectly softened piquillo peppers, ballooning with barely warmed goat cheese and topped with pine nuts and golden raisins. YUM. \u00a0It is just such a beautiful combination and one that I can't wait to emulate at home. \u00a0   I had forewarned the man to stick with the small plates, but the steak was calling to him. I didn't taste it as I am not eating meat these days, but the consensus was that it was \"ok\" and \"not $30 good.\" \u00a0Also, he did not finish it! 12 years together and this has only happened a handful of times.  But all was good as we ended the meal with the cornbread and fruit dessert which was just perfect. \u00a0We both loved it.  Yes, newness is relative, but to me Piperade felt novel. \u00a0If you have an open mind and an adventurous palate, Piperade is worth the money.",

Plus, if you've got a book or a friend with you, you can go sit out at Levi's Plaza and just chill while you eat.   While I've only had about 3 or 4 of the items they serve, everything that I see coming from behind the counter looks and smells great. Personally, I recommend (in the this order) the Turkey and Brie, the Chicken and Avocado, and the Ham and Cheese. I think I'm pretty dead-on with my choices too... because that seems to be the order in which they run out of these items.  Which alas, brings me to why I can only give Piperade To-Go three stars. If you don' t get there early, there's a pretty good chance you aren't going to get your top choice. I consider myself lucky to get there when they still have Turkey and Brie, the only reason I've tried the Ham and Cheese is because they ran out of my top two choices, and today when I got there at 1:30, I was met with, \"We only have soup.\"   I'm sure there is a well-constructed supply and demand reason for all this. And I'll keep going back because I do love the lunch. But I don' t know - maybe I'm just old-fashioned - I always thought \"having the food\" was sort of a basic principle in the lunch biz...",

We started with piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and accented with raisins golden raisins and nuts. The sweetness of the peppers paired extremely well with thin slices of Serrano ham.

I saved this for a special occasion, but sadly, the dinner was pretty disappointing.  1. They lost our reservation. I made the reso on Seatme, and changed the date once. When I got to the restaurant, they didn't have my name down for the evening. In the end we were seated, but I still thought it was unprofessional to not have the updated reservation information. What if they were completely booked? I made the reservation specifically for a special occasion.  2. They ran out of the calamari appetizer, which we were really looking forward to.  3. We ended up getting the mushroom tart and stuffed piquillo peppers. They were pretty lackluster and small for sharing.  4. The steak was overcooked. That was probably the worst thing that happened. The lamb was great, but the steak was pretty egregious. Not sure what happened there. I also thought that the accompaniments with the meat were mediocre - didn't really add to the dish at all.",

Perhaps it's unfair to compare the two but if you see the Piperade name, you expect a certain standard.   The Basque influence of the mother-ship does not fully transfer over to the pick-up lunch spot. On that note, Piperade To-Go doesn't actually cook anything. Everything's done at Piperade's kitchen (the server said so himself) then brought to this little nook. Some of the quality must have fallen off the trolley along the way I guess. Not that it's inedible by any means but the fried chicken in a Mr. Williams sandwich for example, has long lost its crunch by the time you put it in you mouth.   With that said though, I really like the folks who work here. Upbeat and friendly, they kept conversations going plus they also take cards which is nice. I can see how having a salad here is the thing to do since they don't really make anything in-house but for a lunch time spot, I think there are better options around.",

    "review_text": "I dined here last night with 5 other people, at the suggestion of one of the couples in our party. They had been here twice before, and raved about it. I've known about Piperade for quite some time but had never dined there. I was looking forward to trying it out!  Unfortunately, since last night was the Chinese New Year's Parade, all of us were running way behind for our reservation. I called the restaurant and the person on the phone was very nice and understanding and told me not to worry about it - it had been a theme all night and everything was running behind. We finally all made it and after ordering drinks at the bar we were seated a short time later. Our server, who was on the older side and possibly European (?), came by pretty quickly and announced the specials. My boyfriend and I wanted to order a bottle of wine, and I instructed my boyfriend to inquire about a bottle in the $40-50 price range. the wine list is pretty extensive, so we were hoping the server would make things easier on us by offering a few suggestions. He immediately said \"the Rioja is very good\" so I flipped over to that page and saw that both the ones he suggested were either $60 or $70. If I were in charge I would have kept looking for something in our price range, but my boyfriend is more impulsive. He asked our server \"which one is better??\" and what do you think the server said? \"oh, the $70 one!\" That REALLY irritated me. I wasn't the one paying for dinner, so I let it go. Also, when the server was going around taking our orders, I said I would be ordering a few small plates and not an entree. My boyfriend had to tell our server 2-3 times that he was NOT ordering an entree.  Anyway, our food was very good, a bit pricey at least for my small plates, but it arrived pretty quickly. Our server was not the most attentive, I'm not even sure he ever came by to check on us and ask how we were doing. We ordered dessert, and then the bill came. I wasn't involved in the bill paying process, but we paid with one credit card and the rest cash. When server guy came to collect the receipt, he opened up the folder, looked at it for a minute, then walked over to a nearby vacant table and looked at it some more. We all kind of looked at each other like \"WTF?\" He returned and commented that our tip was really low considering the amount of our check. I took a look at the bill and realized that my friend had tipped on the amount HE paid with credit card, not the total bill. His mistake, and we corrected it. \u00a0It was most definitely an uncomfortable moment, and I honestly don't know what I would do if I were in his position, but he definitely had major attitude with us!   In summary, I thought the food was very good, the appetizers were a bit on the pricey side (two apps equal the cost of an entree), the ambiance was very nice, and I'm still really irritated at the server upselling us on a more expensive bottle of wine than we wanted to pay for. Oh! I almost forgot - he didn't even ASK who all was having wine, he just started pouring glasses! Two members of our party were drinking something else, and one doesn't drink at ALL! Grrrrr. Not sure if I'll be in a rush to come back here.",

Last night, we had a perfect dinner. For apps: an excellent tomato tartlet and yummy piquillo peppers. For entrees, we had the awesome duck, the awesome halibut, and the excellent pork. Even the fries are good, skinny and crisp. For dessert, the aromatic orange blossom beignets are my favorite and the turron cake is hubby's favorite.   We've always found street parking easily. I wouldn't feel comfortable here in less than business casual, but I have seen plenty of people dressed more casually than that. They also have an excellent wine list (I recommend the Miura pinot for those of you that are clueless).",

Piperade has a really nice ambience - check out the cool bottle chandelier in the center of the room, the cozy lighting and the bar that is oh so worth bellying up to. My fellow diner started with a lemon drop martini, perfectly poured and oh so pretty; I opted for a greyhound, stiff but not unreasonably so.   Dinner itself was pretty durn tasty. I began with a dungeness crab and mango salad concoction which was superb - appropriately fishy, succulent, not overly rich thanks to the mango's fruity acidity. My buddy opted for whole prawns with garlic, parsley and lemon, which was truly epic in its portion size. There must have been 7 or 8 of the suckers lined up on the plate. I would have been quite happy with those two apps and dessert to be honest.   We both had fish dishes for mains. I was a little disappointed in mine - I don't recall what kind of fish it was, but it was about the same size as my app, overpowering cumin and served with a vegetable that just didn't do anything for it. My friend had the sea bass, on the other hand, which was pretty wondrous.  The most interesting thing about the experience was that the waiter actively steered us away from a more expensive wine to a lighter pinot after we had ordered our food, because he felt the wine we'd picked out might overpower the cuisine. I thought that was quite refreshing.   I would definitely dine here again - prices were reasonable and overall the experience was quite pleasant. I'd just steer clear of anything too cumin-laden (and that's coming from a cumin lover, so be warned...)",

We were done eating about 40min after we were seated but sat around for much longer finishing our wine.   * Fried manchego with pickled vegetables - $8 Good appetizer.   * Warm sheep's milk cheese + ham terrine - $15 Served on a bed of fris\u00e9e.

The sauce looked and tasted like a red wine sauce and was a tad salty. I liked the calamari but would have preferred a lighter preparation.  * Braised seafood + shellfish stew with red pepper sauce - $29 The 2 of us shared this, and it was split for us in the kitchen. The seafood was a bit overcooked for my taste. I also found the red pepper sauce too sweet.",

The food was excellent. \u00a0My asparagus side was lovely and my halibut cooked to perfection, but that arugula salad cast a heavenly halo over everything. \u00a0My host, visiting from out-of-town, insisted on Piperade when he usually defers to me on SF restaurants. \u00a0 He reported his meal excellent, too, but I was in raptures and didn't pay much attention (maybe the seafood stew). \u00a0Sorry.

The calamari were very tasty, the cheese just plain boring and not as well aged as expected. The lamb was very good, but the portion was small ( 2 lambchops and 1 sausage). The halibut is the real reason why this is only a 2 star review. The fish was well cooked, nice and juicy, but absolutely plain (i had to ask for salt and pepper). The side of peas was good but then there was the mayonnaise. I'm still not sure what to make of this, but there was a spoonful of mayonaise smeared on the plate and dusted with paprika.

Piperade is one of these random restaurants that seem to get decent reviews but don't really deserve it. I imagine a lot of bridge and tunnels rave about it; folks who haven't experienced the scope of what really amazing food is here in SF, hence the generous 4-star review rating.  The butter lettuce was boring, boring, BORING. The dressing had zero flavor and it came garnished with pretty much nothing. If I wanted a bland bowl of lettuce leaves I would go to the grocery store and throw some olive oil on it. The pork shank was bland too...the meat itself was well prepared - it fell off the bone quite beautifully - but there was no depth or strong flavor to the sauce it came with. There was just nothing special about this meal and it certainly wasn't worth spending good money on.  If it weren't for the delicious dessert, this probably would have been a 2-star meal.

    "review_text": "Piperade is brought to you by chef Gerald Hirigoyen, who also owns nearby Bocadillos. \u00a0There aren't many Basque restaurants in the Bay Area, so it's a good thing that Piperade and Bocadillos are here to represent.  Food: \u00a03 stars. \u00a0 The restaurant has a regular menu and classic Basque dishes served on different nights. \u00a0We chose from the regular menu as the restaurant had already run out of the dish of the day (atlantic cod \"porrusalda\"). \u00a0This would be a running theme throughout the night. \u00a0For appetizers, we had the garlic soup, warm sheep's milk cheese, calamari \"a la plancha\" and dungeness crab salad \"txangurro.\" \u00a0The garlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon, bread and egg was definitely garlicky and too tepid. \u00a0The calamari \"a la plancha\" with fennel, olive, caper and coriander salpicon was the least appealing of the appetizers - the texture was good (not too chewy), but there was not enough flavor. \u00a0The Dungeness crab salad \"txangurro\" with basil, roaster pepper and mango was also a little on the bland side. \u00a0I wonder where they got the crab, considering the recent shortage due to the oil spill... The best dish among the appetizers is the warm sheep's milk cheese and ham terrine with aged sherry, which was a little salty (probably due to the ham), but REALLLLLY GOOOD. \u00a0It's fried and crispy and orrrrgasmic. \u00a0Next were the entrees. \u00a0Like the cod special, the sea bass was also unavailable. \u00a0Fortunately, we had plenty of good things to still choose from. \u00a0The piperade, which is a stew similar to ratatouille, but prepared with onion, sweet peppers, and tomatoes sauted in olive oil, was a standout. \u00a0It had crispy sauteed Serrano ham and poached egg on top. \u00a0The ham totally makes the dish. \u00a0We also had the steamed pacific snapper with spinach and crunchy fried garlic vinaigrette. \u00a0The ingredients melded well together, but they didn't do a good job of fileting and cleaning the fish, as we found some random small bones and scales in the fish. \u00a0The lamb basquaise chop, shoulder and loin with \"zikiro\" vinaigrette was tender and juicy, but just a bit too hearty with the gigante beans that accompanied it - and I do mean gigante. \u00a0The savory filet of duck with salsifis, quince and peppercorns was by far the best dish...I'd order it again and again. \u00a0Desserts were a bit on the average side. \u00a0In keeping with the night's theme, the popular orange blossom beignets were out. \u00a0The caramel custard \"koka\" is basically a glorfied name for flan, but not really that spectacular. \u00a0The chocolate cake with creme fraiche was just okay.  Service: \u00a03 stars. \u00a0Although our waiter was really friendly at times, we mostly couldn't understand him - it must have been his Basque accent. \u00a0Service seemed slow at times, especially to take our order and to take care of the bill.  Atmosphere: \u00a03 stars. \u00a0The decor is simple and modern, accented by a huge wine rack chandelier with empty bottles hanging over the largest table (I'm glad it wasn't hanging over my table - hello, earthquake). \u00a0To describe the atmosphere as convivial is correct. \u00a0My table was practically in the center of the room, and the large parties neighboring both sides of my table were loud and merry (one table was a little on the geeky side, where some guy laughed like Keith Carradine's character from Revenge of the Nerds). \u00a0Lining the walls are intimate two-person tables, where most of the patrons appeared undisturbed by the loud people in the middle. \u00a0The crowd runs the full gamut from nerds to preppies to cougars and more (yes, all were present that night).  Hits: \u00a0 Filet of duck, piperade, warm sheep's milk cheese, plenty of parking at night.  Misses: \u00a0Calamari \"a la plancha\", running out of too many dishes, the revenge of the nerds.  If You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like: \u00a0Bocadillos, Iluna Basque",

My wife and I sat next to the windows and they had not been cleaned for awhile -- that is always a bad sign. \u00a0My lentle soup was luke warm and a relatively small dish for the price. It was good but not as much flavor as I am used to from Piperade -- and it was only warm. \u00a0 The service was O.K. but not a lot of enthusiasm -- you like that extra effort. The main waiter is good but looks like he is ready to retire -- too \u00a0many nights. \u00a0The back up waiter was good but had a personality problem. He had a bad habit of looking the other way when he brought something -- as if he wanted to avoid you like the plague or if you had bad breath or something. The main course was good, it was the sauteed serano ham with a poached egg. \u00a0Good but for $20, a bit over priced. \u00a0The dessert was excellent. The wine from Northern Spain, white, was excellent, but at $45 was one of the lowest priced on the menu -- so the wines are expensive and no deals.

We started the evening off with drinks at the bar, where a friendly French bartender served me up a 'don-OSTIA' as he called it (nunca mejor dicho -- I was definitely feeling it's effects by the time we sat down) -- ginger, juniper, agave and a lemon twist. Very nice and very potent. We started off with the famed stuffed piquillo peppers and though there were only two of them, they did not disappoint. For our main course, I ordered the New York steak and the finac\u00e9e, the duck. The waitress suggested a spot-on Bordeaux to accompany. Both mains were very good, though not outstanding. I preferred the duck and my fianc\u00e9e, the steak (grass is always greener on the other side of the table...), though we both agreed the best part of either dish was the mushrooms that accompanied my steak. Dessert surprisingly stole the show. Rarely, if ever, does something as glorified on Yelp as the orange beigneta has been, live up to the impossible expectations over-zealous yelpers set for it. I must admit, these little doughy puff-balls exceeded even the most hyperbolic reviews. I felt their light orange perfume in my mouth the rest of the evening and woke up this morning thinking about them...My advice, IF they happen to serve these little gems in the morning, would be to check this place out for brunch and get a massive caf\u00e9 creme to accompany a half dozen orange beignetas. In short, we'll be back...soon.",

If you like that, then you should order for sure.  Main: - Duck: this had a really interesting sweet flavor from the pear and sauce. \u00a0The duck was pretty tender, but not the best duck I've had in SF. \u00a0Jardiniere still takes the cake for the best duck in the city. - Sole: BF ordered the sole because he wanted something lighter, and he definitely got it. \u00a0It wasn't anything extraordinary in my opinion - it was actually pretty \u00a0simple... a piece of fish on top of some sauteed spinach.  Dessert: - Orange Blossom Beignets: MAN i am so glad we ordered this. \u00a0We thought it was going to be like an orange blossom flavoring syrup or filling, but the beignets were actually flavored this way! It was SO good.  Overall, the place was pretty good. \u00a0It was kind of in a random area, and nothing else was around it, but it was a cute quiet place. \u00a0I don't think I'd come back here without some sort of deal, but it was still good.",

The separate private party room is both warm and modern with great lighting and natural element effects. Basque reqion wine is showcased, and it was well-paired with the food. The event planner (Stephanie) was very responsive, and I always felt things were in control with her help. The chef/owner came out to met us as we reviewed the menu selections, and he seemed to be present in all good ways the night of the event. We were well taken care of, wined and dined, and it's no exaggeration that EVERY guest raved about the food. This is notable as a few guests are foodies or professionals who've seen a lot of these group events. Most people had the delicious lamb, some the steak, and a few the risotto. The apps were heavenly grilled calamari, the shredded crab, tomatoes, those famous stuffed peppers. All nicely presented. I brought table centerpieces and keepsake items; the staff was great in helping me pack them neatly back before the end of evening. I don't award 5 stars often, but that's the level that Piperade prepared and served the food, and the level of their service, and the feeling I had when we left that night.",

We think the Seafood stew is the best, most flavorful dish we've had so far. I had the lamb which had a perfect crust and was cooked to a nice medium. I believe my boyfriend had the Halibut which was good but not special. The applet tart was delicious last time with the caramel sauce. we tried the beignet which we weren't so fond of though really enjoyed the dry cappucino we had with it. Must say, the beignets I think about over and over are at Epic Roasthouse. Must say that the foie grois is gamey so I'd also pass on that next time. Overall, really lovely and we would return for the Seafood stew with lots of the yummy warm bread!",

    "review_text": "This was just the right restaurant for our anniversary dinner which was followed by a short Uber ride to Beach Blanket Babylon. We dressed up for the occasion, and the warm, romantic atmosphere was perfect. We were glad for our reservation but would have been happy to sit at the bar had there been a wait, or on a warmer evening, outside in the comfortable and very inviting sofas in the patio area. Most diners were in elegantly casual attire, others formal, but everyone seemed to be there for a special meal. And that's what we got: excellent, attentive service from a waiter who had a deep knowledge of the wine list and menu, and an imaginative, fresh, beautifully presented dinner. We ordered the seared sea scallop with parsnip pur\u00e9e and shaved apple appetizer as well as the fris\u00e9e salad with goat cheese stuffed piquillo peppers. Three fat and tender scallops were positively popping with flavor, balanced by the cool and tangy apple. We were tempted to order a second, despite the generous portion. The fris\u00e9e salad was equally delicious--the goat cheese melted like butter in the warm vinaigrette, in savory contrast to the crunch of the salad. My husband ordered the Duck Confit over braised green lentils for his entree. He found it rich, and artfully prepared--moist and hearty but delicately flavored. I had the fish special--a black cod over a leek and potato \"stew.\" The fish was light and not overpowered by the leeks--crisply seared on top, flaky beneath, but overall this dish was the least impressive and blandest of our selections. I unfortunately couldn't persuade my husband to try a dessert so after much difficulty deciding, I chose the \"Dark Chocolate Cake Amatxi\". This was definitely the grand finale: warm, moist, dark chocolate cake with dark chocolate garnish and a truly marvelous, tangy creme fraische. We'll be back!",

We arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation and sat at the bar for a bit. \u00a0They have a very good selection of wines and even more of tasty brown liquids :-) \u00a0Though packed, bar service was only a little slow - well done.  The restaurant itself was pretty full and our reservation time came and passed. \u00a0The hostess kept telling us \"almost\" and \"just a few more minutes\" but no table materialized. \u00a0After a quiet word to the manager we were finally seated in a corner table by the window - cozy and quiet, nice since the space does get a bit loud when full.  The food itself was judged excellent by my dining companions with high regard for the lamb and chicken dishes as well the appetizers. \u00a0Unfortunately the vegetarian options were quite limited. \u00a0Though tasty, I wouldn't sing the praises of any of my meal. \u00a0The desserts, on the other hand? TASTY, like OMG tasty. \u00a0I nearly inhaled the Basque Gateau with cherry preserves and the chocolate cake was equally tasty.  The service is where the 3 star rating became a 4. \u00a0Our waiter was more neighborly and attentive than friendly - we liked him, it felt more intimate. \u00a0To apologize for our seating delay, the manager comped us both our desserts and also gave us some tasty dessert wine. \u00a0Classy but more so because our waiter brought over the wine and dessert and said, \"on us and thank you so much for dining with us\". \u00a0No fuss, just genuine feeling.

This year it was Piperade. We chose small plates - a mussel and frisee salad, gigante bean salad, potato gratin, selection of cheeses and jamon serrano.   The first thing about which I must rave - olive oil that is the best I have ever tasted. We wanted to order some but ultimately found out they weren't going to be able to import it anymore. Such a shame because it was luscious. It wasn't too peppery or too green, perfectly balanced, fruity and mellow. YUM!!   The bread was delicious, rather rustic and with terrific texture. Everything else was absolutely excellent. Sadly I can't remember the name of the ny-the-glass Spanish White wine we had. But it was crisp and fruity and a perfect match to everything we ate.

The staff is friendly and extremely knowledgeable. The proximity to my job is unbeatable. Hoping across the street for an expertly mixed manhattan or a well selected half-bottle of wine (well, you have to make the visit worthwhile don't you?) is so convenient.  So this was my second visit. On this visit I had reservations for dinner with a friend. And we seriously needed to catch up. So away we went - yakking up a storm from the moment I walked in the door. So the only negative thing I'm going to say here - the waiter did not seem amused by our rapid-fire conversation. On the contrary he seemed determined to make me feel bad about it. I was not up for that. I ignored him once I realized he was irritated with our lack of attention to him. The service - was fine. Water glasses filled, wine attended to, food explained - \u00a0all adequately. Enough about him. I hope he doesn't wait on me next time.  The food was delicious. I ordered the piquillo peppers stuffed w/ goat cheese - oozing with melty goat cheese. Fantastic. I ordered a half bottle of a pinot noir for myself - reasonably priced and delicious as well. My companion ordered the calamari \"a la plancha\" - offered me a bite - and thank god for generosity! Another great dish - fresh, refreshing, just the right size. I ordered the New York steak and was extremely pleased. Cooked to perfection - with wonderful gascon fries and caramelized shallots.  My first visit a month or so prior - I sat at the bar with a friend. I ordered a manhattan on the rocks. The bartender was so personable - the cocktail was perfection. I really like this bar. We ate at the bar that night and I have to say I will be doing that many more times.  This is a beautiful dining experience - worth every penny you may spend. This establishment is seriously devoted to making your experience within its 4 walls worth the effort of the visit. I hope they save a seat at the bar for me......this Wednesday.",

The plate was eventually removed from the table as if everybody orders a $32 dish just to eat two bites. Nobody asked me how it was or if I was enjoying it. They don't care if you like the food and apparently they don't care if the food is properly prepared in the first place. Once our dinner order was placed in the beginning, we no longer existed and the staff was just going through the motions. They just want to get you in and get you out!

The resturant is located in the 1000 block of Battery which in the evening offers lots of free parking close by so that was definately a plus. The resturant is set in what looks like an old factory - with it's old unreinforced brick masonary look giving it an old world feel. \u00a0When we were seated for our 7:30 reservation the place was crowded, and , like another reviewer mentioned, not a lot of young people under 30 there. \u00a0Our waiter was very helpful and the wine list was truly impressive. \u00a0The small dishes were superb. \u00a0We ordered the Garlic Soup which I found to be delicious, but then again I love garlic. \u00a0My companion was not so enthused with it. The heirloom tomato, herbs, and watermelon dish was a feast for the taste buds and definatley a must here as was the braised calimari in tomato sauce. \u00a0In fact according to a friend that dines here often, you can't go wrong with any of the small dishes. \u00a0Our dining experience went south, however, when I ordered the Basque Special which was Duck.with lentils and mango I believe. \u00a0The lentils and friuity sauce was wonderful but it couldn't save the bird which was so over cooked that I've had ducks that have been hanging in the windows of Chinatown for a week that were more tender and moist. \u00a0The leg and thigh portion was so dry and tastless and was helped little by the fruity sauce. I guess it was my bad that I didn't return it but I tried to struggle on with the dish. \u00a0On the other hand the Angus beef with carmalized onions was incredible. The deserts were only so so as well as the flan I had was rather ordinary. \u00a0Outside the washroom, which was as hot as a sauna, framed clippings and magazine covers heralding \u00a0this resturant. lined the walls. \u00a0My trip here was just a little less enthusiastic. Our waiter, it should be mentioned, \u00a0was attentive throughout and if I ever go back here I would stick to small dishes exclusively as I saw others at the surrounding tables do.",

We decided to get a variety of small plates.  - House cured Bacalao: salty, fresh, oysters were good - Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese: must be a fan of creamy goat cheese, but not bad - Wild mushrooms: looked like a mini mushroom pizza, nicely saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, but the crust wasn't that great tasting - Calamari: a bit on the rubbery side, too many toppings/flavors going on that didn't quite go well together  Overall, I really liked the atmosphere, but the food was a bit disappointing. Service was excellent. I will probably come back to try their entrees.",

Friday's Quinoa special contains about 4 \u00a0times the serving size quinoa should be and vinaigrette seriously lacks in the vinegar department.

I have always been happy with the service. The wait staff probably errs on leaving you alone more than some may be comfortable with, but I'm rather easily irritated by waiters who are constantly asking if I need anything.

Our server really did not have it together - I had to flag her down for just about everything we needed. We waited for quite a while before I could get her attention to take our order, and then she brought out the entrees before we had received our appetizers. She also brought us the wrong bottle of wine, and was just generally inattentive - I expected much higher quality service from a restaurant of this caliber. Also, the food was good, but not stellar. I had the arctic char with broccoli rabe and chorizo - it was much too salty, and I couldn't finish it (and I generally like things on the saltier side).

    "review_text": "Primary disclosure: my girl and I have been cooking Spanish food for many months now - every weekend, twice a weekend. Became slightly obsessed with it, actually. Penelope Casas, I think I love you. I've said, quite seriously, that I could eat in the Spanish style for the rest of my life and never be dissatisfied. It's one of those 'last meal' kind of questions. Last lifetime cuisine? Spanish contends. That noted, I might have reached my Spanish ceiling. With this in mind, we come to Piperade - overall, excellent, exceptional perhaps, but nothing we could not or did not do ourselves. We tried as much as we could and drank Viognier the entire meal long.  We started with small plates and made our way to one big plate - it was far too much food.  Calamari 'a la plancha' with fennel, olive, caper, and coriander salpicon ($12): Probably my favorite because I find it hard to resist perfectly cooked squid - a touch salty, mind you, but intentionally so and explosively flavored.  House cured bacalao with oyster tartare and lemon creme fraiche ($13): Nice, also salty (it's thinly sliced salt cured cod!), but very sound - oysters a nice contrast and the creme fraiche a needed cut against the salt of the bacalao.  Grande white bean salad with boquerones, fresh herbs, and crushed egg ($11): Fantastic, actually. But this is also why I opened with my disclosure. This is a classic Spanish dish. Not much to it if you have the best ingredients - simple simple simple - but miraculous in its simplicity. The Spaniards love egg (and ham), olive oil (it's like oxygen), boquerones are one of my 5 favorite foodstuffs (they change all the time), and the white beans were heirloom-good. If you have never tried heirloom beans, give them a go - they are notable.  Piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts, and golden raisins ($13): Another delicious dish. Spanish food has enlightened me to the divinity of the properly prepared red pepper. Before we started cooking Spanish, red pepper of any sort never appealed to me. Piquillo peppers? Nom nom nom. Stuffed and roasted with goat cheese, pine nuts, and golden raisins? So obvious, right? Indeed. You cannot go wrong. But this is the genius of Spanish cooking my friends.  Thinly sliced serrano ham ($16): Quite possibly my favorite foodstuff, ever - I have dirty dreams about serrano ham. I do not know why, I could be mad, but I find serrano significantly superior to prosciutto - deeper, subtler, less salty, more complex, more fulfilling, more luscious - my palate slides softly into an ecstatic delirium. Rightfully, they do nothing to the serrano - I do not like it heated or cooked (it loses its life force). Why is this not my favorite small plate? Well, that's a lot of $ for a small plate of thinly sliced cured ham. So I reward the imagination of the calamari a la plancha - however, if I could take only one to my grave, it's serrano by a mile. And smokes. And wine.  Garlic soup with rock shrimp, bacon, bread, and egg ($9): Easily the most disappointing dish - not bad, not great, just adequate - no rich garlic essence, average little shrimp, bits of so-so bacon, a nice bread cube, an egg-drop kind of egg, and a far too salty broth.  Finally, the big plates all looked interesting but, as noted many times now, we've done a lot of Spanish cooking and wanted something slightly more special. So we went with the Friday night Basque classic. I preferred other Basque classics on the menu, but you only have one choice each night. Which takes us to...  ...Albacore 'marmitako' with saffron potato stew ($26): Good. The tuna reminded me why I prefer my tuna on the raw side. Thick tuna muscle, cooked fully, loses flavor, loses the lushness of its fat maybe - and so maybe more olive oil and a pinch of salt would have improved the fish. The saffron potato stew was classically Spanish with julienned red peppers (which I would have preferred skinned) - sound, classic, good. That's about it. We were way too full to finish and boxed it for home. It heated up just fine for lunch.   To close as I began, if we did not cook so much Spanish food, every dish we had (with the exception of the garlic soup) would have been more impressive - as is, still a sound 4 stars. Service, ambiance, excellent.",

The soup reminded us of homemade, tummy warming broth that you'd find in someone's kitchen. Calamari was nicely prepared as well, not over or under cooked.  I had the duck and my girlfriend had the steak. I really liked my duck and I noticed the portions there were pretty generous for a somewhat \"fancy\" place. My girlfriend really liked her steak seeing as that she ate the entire thing.  The dessert was a chocolate cake, but I found it too rich and heavy.  Overall, would recommend this restaurant, especially on a nice night where you can sit outside on their cute patio!",

We were greeted by an incredibly congenial staff and the setting is very warm and intimate with its low exposed ceilings and brick walls.   Now for the food...  Had the chicory salad and mussels with frisee'. YUM. Chicory salad was a nice and pleasant intro to our entrees, but nothing out of this world. The Mussels and frisee on the other hand, MM! Perfect bites of mussels, with frisee, with tiny crunchy croutons and parsley...so good.   For our entrees I had the steelhead and oh my god...Out comes this beautiful hunk of fish topped with a foam and bedded over a beautiful melange of vegetables and...dare i say it...BACON. Of course bonus points go to any chef who incorporates bacon into a dish, but boy was this was special. Each bite was just a perfect bit of smokey, buttery deliciousness. My sister ate the lamp chops with parsnip and sausage and that was also fantastic. The lamb literally melts in your mouth...Mom had the duck confit, also stellar. Probably some of the best duck I've ever had.   Desserts: Chocolate cake and quince clafoutis.  Warning about the chocolate cake, you will die and go straight to heaven. This is the most rich, moist chocolate cake I've EVER HAD. And let's just say I eat a lot of chocolate cake, ok? The quince clafoutis is for people who want to finish dinner lightly, and not feeling like a stuffed turkey. It was really yummy, and I've never had quince as part of a dessert like that, so it was a welcomed change.   Overall, GO TO PIPERADE. You will not regret it!!",

It's in an alley southwest of the Pottery Barn headquarters. (Mad props to the chef inside of the main Piperade for giving me directions)  I haven't been to the sit down establishment yet (it's bookmarked for sure!), so I can't compare this to-go stand location to it.   I had the yelp-recommended Mr. Williams. The sandwich took a bit of time to make, so be prepared to wait. There are plenty of pre-made sandwich, wrap, and spring roll options if you need a quick grab and go option.   The chewy, crusty bread was excellent!-- totally worth the carbs. The breaded chicken was crispy and perfectly complimented with cheese, avocado, and roasted red peppers. The lightly dressed small salad of mixed greens was simple and a nice sidekick to the sandwich.   I will certainly be back to try the turkey and Brie sandwich and a wrap when I need a quick lunch near my home",

    "review_text": "YUM. I have been a loyal Piperade guest since probably 2006. It is consistently an enjoyable spot, whether you're just popping in for a drink (or 3) at the bar, indulging in a few apps, or sitting down to a full-fledged dinner.  I must start off with what I consider the beacon of their menu, which is the Calamari a la Plancha. If you are someone who only enjoys calamari when it is battered and fried to death, then this is not for you. What it is, in all of its tasty glory, is a perfectly cooked squid (not battered or fried) drizzled with a red wine-type of sauce that is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Don't skip the bread basket as you'll want to use a piece or two to sop up any remaining sauce after you've thoroughly enjoyed the calamari itself.  Although the menu changes seasonally, I think I have tried almost everything or at least a version of what is on the current menu. Honestly, I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't enjoy. I generally change up my order depending on what I am in the mood for that day. If you happen to pop in on a Tuesday, don't skip the Calamari with Ink Sauce (if two calamari dishes are too much for you, might I suggest starting with the Crab Tower or Piquillo Peppers instead?). If it's not Tuesday, my go-to entree is probably the Duck; my best girlfriend alternates between the Lamb and the Shellfish Stew.  If there are at least two of you, be sure to get the manchego gratin as a side. You won't be disappointed.  Lastly, don't forget to finish off with some dessert. Although I tend to be a chocolate fanatic (and their dark choc cake is fantastic), I usually end up getting the almond mousse cake. It is a little more unique and is a great, light-ish way to finish off such a tasty meal.  Now I may need to visit Piperade tonight now that I've relived all of these dishes in my mind while writing this review...",

    "review_text": "I've heard a lot about Piperade so I was so excited to finally try it. I also haven't been to too many Spanish Basque restaurants so that added to my excitement.  First of all, the chef/owner, Gerald Hirigoyen is so sweet. When we got there, he was playing host and kept making sure we were happy with our food and our service. Their service in general was awesome and they understood how food lovers love to eat. We like to share. So our waiter always made sure we had extra small plates so we can try each other's dishes.  For appetizers, we had their Serrano Ham and they give you a very generous heap of this. Awesome. Also ordered their roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and served with golden raisins and pistachio. I never realized how well roasted peppers went with golden raisins. This was delicious. I think my favorite was the foie gras with rhubarb compote though. I've never had foie gras with rhubarb so this was an eye opener for me. The flavors were so complimentary I couldn't stop eating it.  For the main dish, I ordered their Tuesday Special which was calamari with roasted peppers rice and squid ink. Now this was AMAZING. I've always been a huge fan of squid ink anything so when I took the first bite, I was in heaven. The squid was cooked perfectly and went really well with the roasted pepper, rice and ink. When you combined all four together in your mouth, you just didn't want the dish to end. The rock fish with spinach that my boyfriend ordered wasn't very good. The spinach was very chalky. A little disappointing. BUT my other friend's dish, duck with cherries and sunchokes was another amazing dish. I highly recommend that too.  For dessert, I had their Gateau Basque (of course) with bing cherries. This was an awesome way to end my perfect dinner. I'm looking forward to the next time I come here. I fell in love with this place. The restaurant is nice and homey and the food has that homey flavor too.",

My husband and I had a reservation at 8:30PM and were running a few minutes late. \u00a0The hostess thanked us for the call and let us know there would not be a problem. \u00a0  Upon arrival we were seated promptly in a window seat. \u00a0The restaurant has a warm feeling and my stomach had a very hungry feeling so we got to ordering right away.  Sparkling water was brought to our table upon request and we each ordered a glass of rose - delicious, dry, and a gorgeous ruby color. \u00a0  We each ordered the Prix Fixe menu and were not disappointed. \u00a0I tacked on the Haricot Vert salad which was delicious and the perfect mix of mint and amazingly fresh flavors. \u00a0As a starter it tantalized the palate. My first course was the soup of the day - lentil bean, I believe. \u00a0It was hearty and warm, perfect for the all-too-typical freezing San Francisco summer weather outside. \u00a0My husband had the green salad. \u00a0  We both ordered the pork which was of the fall-off-the-bone-and-into-our-mouths variety. \u00a0This all sat atop a bed of cabbage which was equally enjoyable.  For dessert my husband had the Gateau and I the Orange Blossom Beignets. \u00a0They disappeared shortly after arrival, not surprisingly. \u00a0  Since we'd let the restaurant know this was a special occasion (hubby and my last date before the new baby arrives) I believe they surprised us with a sparkling muscat after dinner. \u00a0It was so SMOOTH! \u00a0I forgot to ask what bottle it was, regretfully. \u00a0I guess I'll just have to return! \u00a0  Woe is me. \u00a0Finding another San Francisco favorite yet seven years too late. \u00a0I'll have to make up for lost time!",

    "review_text": "I hadn't heard of Piperade until I picked up a recent Bloomspot promotion and boy oh boy am I glad I did! The food was hands down some of the best I've had in the city and the presentation was equally as impressive. The last time I had basque food was in a casual environment with heaping family style portions so I wasn't sure what to expect with a higher end establishment.   Starters: We started with the Picquillo Peppers and the Sheep's Milk Cheese + Ham and both were amazing, packed with tons of unique flavors--nothing like I've experienced before. I also tried the split pea soup with ham, which was very fresh and tasty, and unlike your traditional green gooey split pea soup (which I also very much enjoy). And like most restaurants, they provided bread and olive oil. The bread was pretty average but the olive oil was very tasty and had a strong olive flavoring. I probably should have stopped after my 5th piece of bread...   Entrees: I ordered the Roasted Rack of Lamb, which was cooked to order (medium-rare) with a charred outter layer. The lamb was packed with flavor and was very tender, and was not too gamey. My dish also came with braised fennel and a sausage which complimented the lamb very well! My fiance ordered the Pacific Petrale Sole over a bed of spinach and fried garlic. Mmmm-mmmm that combination makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I think I enjoyed her dish more than mine!  Dessert: By this time, we were pretty stuffed but we decided to split a dessert: the Gateau Basque. This was a nice dessert given our level of stuffedness because it was very light and not overly sweet. There was a very subtle hint of almond which I loved. All in all, a great choice.  Service: We were sat immediately per our reservation. Our server was very nice and informative. She didn't come by often, but she also didn't neglect us. My fiance and I had time to chat without being interrupted every 5 minutes, so that was nice.  Overall, my fiance and I were pleasantly surprised at this restaurant and will 100% be returning, next time with friends and family to help spread the word!",

They also have $20 corkage, which is pretty good. The servers at Piperade were also nice enough to split the shared plates for us (at no charge! and we didn't even have to ask!!).  We shared the stuffed peppers for appetizer, had the lamb and the steak for entrees and the apple tart for dessert.  The stuffed peppers weren't too heavy even though it was filled to the gills with goat cheese. The sweetness of the peppers married well with the tartness of the cheese. It was simple and not over done. A must order!  The rack of lamb is arguably the best that I've ever experience. It was perfectly medium rare -- great flavor and tender as butter. It would use a bit more of that delicious sauce, but the meat was amazing on its own. I also adored the poached fennel. Compliments to the chef.  The steak was slightly overcooked, more like medium than medium rare. Nevertheless, the beef had great flavor and a nice crust from the sear. The polenta fries were crispy on the outside and cheesy/tender on the insider. The watercress salad was slight overdressed and probably the heaviest tasting item on the plate, but the acidity cut through some of the richness of the dressing. The sauce was nutty and complex. It certainly helped out with the slightly overcooked meat. Maybe we'll order it rare next time.  The apple tart was very thin with slivers of overlapping apple slices. There's a nice crust from the caramelized sugar. The star of the show is definitely the caramel sauce. I overheard another table order their apple tart with extra caramel -- they probably are repeat customers and know how great the sauce is.  Overall, I highly recommend the place. The service is efficient without being intrusive or too chatty. The noise level is low so a good place for date night.",

    "review_text": "I'll keep this review at 4 stars, although I am VERY tempted to lower it to 3 stars... My first experience was more like a 4.5, so I'll knock down to 3.5 and round up. \u00a0  As a person who has had the \"opportunity\" to work in a restaurant as a Server, I have a LOT of patience toward restaurant personnel, BUT I also value good service tremendously. \u00a0  We came for the 2nd time in a one week period to celebrate a great friend's birthday. \u00a0We were a group of 9 and we spent a LOT of money, as you can imagine. \u00a0Service-wise, the experience was NIGHT and DAY from the previous experience. \u00a0Our server hardly seemed to care about how we were doing/ our experience, etc. \u00a0Very shocking, especially in this economy. \u00a0Lady, there are a thousand people out there who would kill for your job about now... just saying.  I won't say the service was terrible, just negligent. \u00a0She seemed pretty nonchalant: water glasses were not refilled. \u00a0She never poured wine from the bottle, we had to do so ourselves.... \u00a0Now, I admit it can be annoying when a waiter seems to practically ram the wine down your throat so that you'll buy more bottles, hence a larger bill, BUT at such a large table, where conversation was flowing, it's not so easy to halt the conversation, yell to the person on the other side to pass the wine... that's when it's useful for the server to step in and assist. \u00a0Not once did she refill a wine glass. \u00a0As we were waiting for our desserts, we realized that we still had 1/2 a bottle of wine leftover and the lushes in the group (including me of course!) had to start chugging!  I made a BIG mistake and ordered the Rockfish (minus 1 star) -- quite boring and bland. \u00a0Basic basic boring white fish served over steamed spinach. \u00a0In fact, I think that I enjoyed the spinach more than the fish! \u00a0But I'll take 1/2 the blame because the description on the menu wasn't all that... don't know WHAT possessed me to order it, to be honest.  My husband, however, ordered the Lamb Chop entree (plus multiple stars!!!) \u00a0OMG.... that is the winning dish for sure. \u00a0Hands down the BEST thing on the menu (besides the beignets, but I'll get into that in a moment). \u00a0Super tender, served med-rare, meaty, tasty, YUM!!! \u00a0It is served with soft roasted potatoes, soft roasted onion and a mini-lamb sausage as well. \u00a0I want to go back right now and get that dish! \u00a0LOVE it.  As for dessert, we had been raving about the beignets all night (since we had enjoyed them just a few days prior).... I SWEAR folks at the tables around us MUST have heard us rave, because as we are going around the table ordering, they RAN OUT!!!! \u00a0So, two of us got to order the Beignets but by the time our lovely server got around to my hubby and I, they were all out. \u00a0OMG!!! \u00a0I could have cried. \u00a0We ended up ordering the Flan, which was also delicious. \u00a0But we bartered 3/4 of the dish for 1 beignet!!! \u00a0It was worth it too.... \u00a0Oh, by the way, we had to ASK for coffee, aren't they supposed to ask by default?",

For the appetizers we had the calamari and some mushroom pie dish (sorry, I'm not good with names). The mushroom appetizer was so delicious. The mix between the flaky crust on the bottom and combination of the mushrooms on top were great with each bite. The calamari was good as well. Not your typical fried calamari. It was more of a marinated calamari, but the flavors were really good and had a nice kick to each bite as well.   For my entree, I had the cornish hen. The dish was pretty damn good. The hen was cooked perfectly and it had some vegetables in the mix of the dish. It wasn't overcooked or nothing and it had great flavor.   This is a great place to go to. A little bit on the expensive side but it's a nice place to dine at. The ambiance is really nice too. The service was great too. Our waiter was attentive and kind. \u00a0Just be aware of the neighborhood. While it's in a nice location of the city, my car got broken into just a few steps away from the restaurant. I guess that's the city for you no matter where you are.   Enjoy.",

Meal: fish - I can't seem to remember which fish dish it was but it had beans and mussels, unfortunately this was partially my fault as I failed to read what else was in the dish and it happened to be two things I don't quite enjoy. \u00a0Nonetheless I ate the fish, although I must say that the fish alone was not tasty. \u00a0I suppose you should eat it altogether but overall my poor choice did not make me very satisfied.  The restaurant here had an ok ambience. \u00a0It was definitely filled and our server did an acceptable job (not too annoying where you just want to be left alone, but never forgot you were there). \u00a0I'm not sure if I would ever go back though, I'm too scared that my food choice will leave me disappointed again.",

Their delectable and deliciously good looking, small dishes!  Starting out with their Dungeness Crab, presentation was splendid and the grapefruit pieces, added a nice tangy complimentary taste. \u00a0Next up, their Sheep's Milk Cheese mixed in with Ham Terrine and Aged Sherry, was phenomenal! \u00a0I am already a sucker when it comes to aged cheese! \u00a0Add the gamey taste to the cheese and salted ham with the whole sha-bang, we have a winner on this tapa dish! \u00a0I liked their Piquillo Peppers filled with Goat Cheese, topped with golden raisins and sprinkled with pistachio crumbs! \u00a0You can't go wrong with their unique, small tapas!  Onto their main dishes! \u00a0Their Braised Seafood in Shellfish Stew was rich on the variety from the sea, but the salmon was plain dry. \u00a0Too overcooked. Their House Special of the Day, mango slices topped on a medium rare thick pork chop, was not to my liking. \u00a0I have to commend on their Rack of Lamb, however. \u00a0It was cooked and seasoned perfectly!  Their small dishes are preferred over the main plates! \u00a0Dishes were served out fast. \u00a0The staff was accommodating and polite.

    "review_text": "It has probably been 10 years since I last ate at Piperade. My memories were that of a dark cozy restaurant buzzing with people and plates of comfort food. A wonderful experience.  It was with some trepidation that I returned: I mean you read the Yelp reviews that give one or two stars \u00a0and the complaints of indifferent service and long waits.  Well my friends those reviews, Imho, are greatly exaggerated and unfounded from my experience.  Piperade still has that certain charm and warmth that is exemplified in the Basque culture. First of all when we arrived there was Chef Hirigoyen, outside, enjoying a glass of wine after a long afternoon of work. He is a very approachable guy and it was fun to chat with him.  The service was really nice. My friend asked, after we had been seated for a while, if we could move and they did it quickly without any hassle. The waiters are warm and friendly but they arent in a hurry to get you in and out.....and I really appreciated this.  The food was really good. It is pretty pricey but the quality is pretty stellar. The crab appetizer was amazing. Nothing but chunks of light, fluffy, fresh crab. Lightly dressed with some blood oranges and vinaigrette. Seriously I could have eaten three of these.  The other appetizers were the mushroom tart which was a great flaky pastry with loads of very fresh and flavorful shrooms.  The salad was boring and I would skip.  The mains were the shinning star of this place. My duck was cooked to perfection. Light crunchy skin, succulent meat that was not dry at all. The seafood stew was also amazing: chalked full of mussles, calamari, and prawns....it was good. The steak was also very nice albeit boring. We oredered two sides and they were amazing. The gratan was lovely potatoes and cheese. The lentils were lovely.  The surprise of the meal were the desserts. They were lackluster and basically boring. The beignets \u00a0were cold and paled in comparison to spruce's. The apple tart was so so. The chocolate cake was another boring production.  Finally the wine list is impressive and you can find good wines at pretty reasonable prices. We ordered a bottle of 2007 Clarendelle Bordeaux..... a really really nice wine at 40 dollars.  For a special occasion I think Piperade hits all the right notes.",
