I recommend their Caprese sandwich, the steak sandwhich, or the pastrami reuben on rye(?). I've had several of these sandwiches, and you can't go wrong with them. Their soups as well, I enjoyed the wedding soup and spicy turkey chili. There is always great company here, the bartenders are very helpful and friendly.

There were 4 people that ordered before us, but the place wasn't very busy at all as the lunch rush was over. I ordered my food at 1:10, got the pesto chicken sandwich, and was with 3 other coworkers. Well it gets to be 1:46 and I'm like wtf did they have to go kill a chicken for this? My coworkers food finally came out, we all had to switch it to go, but mine still wasn't there. I had to go to the back and complain and was like \"it took you guys 40 minutes to make a sandwich\" and the person who seemed in charge seemed to care less and said I'm sorry but didn't try to offer me anything for the inconvenience...(money off, a free drink, etc...) Instead they just didn't seem to give a shit ... Food was mediocre at best...I've had better sandwiches elsewhere in the city for a quarter of the wait. I don't know about the rest of the working san Franciscans, but I don't have time to spend over 40 minutes waiting for a sandwich to be prepared.

Hint: pick up the menu because there's a couple more things on there than what's listed on the big board. \u00a0Like chips and guacamole. \u00a0I needed a small amount of sustenance to go with my beer and newsletter-writing and couldn't find anything on the board....but picked up the menu and voila!   Grabbed a great table close to the front window and went to work. \u00a0I will say the guac was definitely lacking. \u00a0Lots of chips....tiny bowl with basically smashed avocado. \u00a0I do kinda think she was trying to warn me by asking if I wanted to have salsa with it - \"it would be really good that way\" (I think back to her eyes....they were trying to tell me something).

For the first time I can say I know of a good restaurant to meet new people and make friends. It's a great place for locals to gather and talk about their community and develop camaraderie. The owners are there EVERY day and you couldn't tell based on their big smiles and warm demeanors. They ask you about you, they remember things you've told them about yourself, they want you to feel like part of the family. It's really a wonderful place.  And if all those warm fuzzy feelings aren't enough, the place has AMAZING food. Some of the best lattes I've ever had, fresh donuts every day, a huge variety of sandwiches, soups, CHILI DOGS and salads and they even have temporary items they switch out daily/weekly. A couple weeks ago they had a KILLER meatball sub and now they have awesome hummus sandwiches. They really add a lot of love to their foods.  Top it all off, this place is becoming the next big showcase spot. Comedy nights, trivia nights, MUSIC nights, if I could sleep at the Pig I would. I don't ever wanna miss a minute there. I've been eating at the Pig almost daily for a year now, and I only wish there were twice as many hours in the day.  I LOVE YOU FLYING PIG!!! Don't ever change!!!!",

Another plus is that they have about 4-5 beers on tap. \u00a0Standard stuff; stella, sierra nev, etc.  They are promising a new menu. \u00a0Currently serving soups, salads, and sandos. \u00a0All relatively well priced. \u00a0The bottom line is, sometimes you want something else besides a burrito or taco in the Mission (I know there are other stuff, but what I'm saying is variety is welcomed). \u00a0Go figure right!  The set up is nice. \u00a0A lot of loungey chairs. \u00a0Very clean, low profile decor. \u00a0Unfortunately, I might catch myself taking longer breaks that necessary. \u00a0   Best of luck to these kids. \u00a0Glad to see business folks that haven't been jaded and beat down by San Francisco bureaucracy (not yet at least).",

I guessed that because it was the weekend the breakfast stack on the menu board was not in effect and the brunch menu was the weekend rate at four dollars more. I ended up paying fourteen dollars and change for boring scrambled eggs, two pieces of warm sourdough bread (not toast), bland warmed up boiled potatoes, and a pile of soggy bacon,as I was not offered the option, but wanted sausage, and a bottle of soda. Very disappointed I left the pile of bacon and potatoes and hoped I wouldn't get sick. Bad experience bad recommendation by a business owner in the area. Maybe they were in cahoots.",

The chalk board menu had a good selection of typical bistro food like sandwiches and salads. Their coffee and tea menu was impressive as well, and even offered almond milk as a dairy substitute for an additional $.50. I really liked that because I don't run into many coffee shops that have this option. I didn't order beer but I skimmed the wine and beer list they had on the bar and I probably would have ordered something if that was what I wanted.  I had the turkey, avocado and havarti cheese sandwich on a whole wheat roll with a side garden salad and it was really tasty and exactly what I was in the mood for. I wish I had known they put mayo in it beforehand (sometimes sandwiches come with it, sometimes they don't) and that was my mistake for not asking, but I just scraped it off with a knife and it was fine. The sandwich was big and was cut in half, so I ate one and saved the other for lunch the next day.   The bar area had 3 big tv's in full view, so no matter where you're sitting you'll be able to catch whatever game they have on at the moment. I can't really pinpoint the atmosphere of this bistro. To me I kind of got a mixture of old saloon to grandma's cottage in the woods because of the wooden bar shelves, wooden round tables, and wooden chairs with a weaved backing. However the walls had some modern looking paintings on canvas of naked women with hammers and Disney princesses.  Overall, my boyfriend and I both enjoyed our food. The bartender was extremely nice when she was helping us, and the place was quiet and cozy. Can't complain here!",

Lo and behold a little Yelp-search for restaurants nearby brought this one to light--and it's got GLUTEN FREE stuff! And not just one option, but lots. And not just those dinky gluten-free sandwiches you find more and more places now (don't get me wrong, I'm grateful even for that option), and not a disgusting, cardboard-bread tasting sandwich either; they have GLUTEN FREE focaccia (worth the $2 more; you can get regular GF bread for just $1 more, but I'm in love with the focaccia) and make a mean sandwich! I've gone twice and had the salami sandwich and today had the turkey and avocado with Havarti dill. I have been impressed both times. And my bf loves the mango chicken sandwich. AND I found out that they have gluten-free turkey chili as well as various soups of the day (of which there is usually at least one GF option). This place is awesome. Free wi-fi, too, and it looks like they show games on game days (four + TVs). The only drawback I've noticed so far is the difficulty parking, but they can't be held to blame for that. And it should be noted that they are incredibly easy to access via public transit, which is even cooler (off of 16th on South Van Ness--you can take the #22 or the #33 or walk from 16th Street BART.

The Pig asks a slightly higher price, and so does The Sandwich Place, which may have the most interesting menu choices, but only for take out from a block that can get pretty gross. For a no frill sit down meal, with almost as interesting menus at a slightly better value, try the other 2. \u00a0  The Pig is much more than a sandwich shop. \u00a0My temptation to hang out there was undeniable, because they have done such a nice job of making their place inviting. \u00a0They took over from previous owners and remodeled just recently. \u00a0The owner tells me they're \"trying to get away from the convenience store feel the space used to have.\" \u00a0I hope their successful effort brings a lot more people in.   On a Sunday afternoon, I only intended to step in for a minute to look around, grab some food and run, but I just had to sit and relax because they had a piano player making the place feel like an old time saloon. \u00a0That seems to be their concept, with the new wood bar, comfy seats, iron fixtures, antique lamps, and arch of plants framing the entrance. \u00a0There were only 3 of us in there to enjoy it (maybe everyone else was at the park), but each piano piece got applause. \u00a0There was a sports game on a big TV too. \u00a0Meanwhile, the gregarious owner got me into some conversation, and tempted me to try a lot more than I came in for. \u00a0I checked a menu full of good sandwich choices, hots and sausages, and chose a pyramid apricot ale, a turkey, avocado and havarti on whole grain, with a side of fruit salad. \u00a0It was so filling I had to take half home.   It makes me super happy to have a cafe with beers on tap and coffee, plus quick takeout meals, right across the street from my apartment. \u00a0There's happy hour prices, and my neighbors told me they have a breakfast menu too. \u00a0I live next to a collective type apartment with tons of people working and living there, and they are excited about this place. I'm with them in wanting it to succeed. \u00a0It's much better than the places that have tried that space before, and more relaxed and welcoming than many nearby.",

First off the fans from the refrigerator or so loud you can't hear your self think let alone hear the auto tuned music they play.  My first sandwich (the flying pig) was super dry for a BBQ sandwich so i tried the starving pig. If you can manage to stomach this sandwich you will not look like your starving. there had to be an entire jar of mayo on my sandwich. It was so bad i couldn't eat it and had to walk out \u00a0with a whole sandwich sitting on my plate.   as for the coffee. I didn't need to try it a second time because it was so bad the first time i wouldn't drink it for free.   I really wish this place was great because it's so convenient but the truth is out.

True to its form, the quiet shop has classic cafe-style chairs and table tops on either side of the door. The scent of coffee confirms that I have found a new local spot to sip my favorite beverage.   \u00a0 \u00a0Only a few blocks between fashionable Valencia St and the high-brow coffee corners of the Soma district, this cozy shop serves as a reminder of what popularized the beverage in the first place. The interior is painted a buttery yellow, with a long bar with a classic and classy feel mirrored by ample seating in warm wood tones. With its unpretentious vibe and offer of free wifi, I feel unrestrained about relaxing into a few hours of work after I order my first cup of the day.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being used to the hurry-up-and-order pace of most barristas, I am almost taken aback by the genuine friendliness I receive upon approaching the counter. My upbeat host guides me through a moderately-priced menu of food and drink, including beer specials on tap. I'm only ready for a cup of coffee and a biscotti, but their menu has me thinking about lunch. I select which roast I'd like (Sumatra) and settle in to a roomy chair. Neighborhood residents come and go, each greeted and sent off with enthusiasm.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chat a bit more with Will, the barrista. I learn that he has recently become co-owner of this local spot. Along his business partner, Ben, both of these gents look forward to making improvements including hanging more art and expanding upon their menu, as well as generating buzz for the new ownership. They are clearly enjoy the endeavor they are undertaking, and every patron has a compliment to give towards the work they have already done.  Cheers, Will and Ben! Looking forward to another cup or a tasty sandwich real soon!",

I feel the need to review this place just to say that The Mission used to have more small, unhip but local businesses like Flying Pig Bistro and slowly they have been pushed out. I appreciate the earlier hours of opening, the thoughtful conversation effort and awkward eagerness by the cashier, the character of the decor and the prompt service.

They gave me both bacon and sausage, and piled it high with added jalapenos and avocado (upcharge there). I paired it with a hot apple cider, and it hit the spot!  If I lived in the Mission, this would also be my go-to bar-- super sweet vibe.",
