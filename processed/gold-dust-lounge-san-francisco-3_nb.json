As we peered across the street from the Boudin Sourdough bread store we saw a cool looking bar and decided to give it a try.  We found out this lounge had just been renovated and re-opened only about a week earlier so our timing couldn't have been better. The place is 100% upscale with everything clean and new throughout. It reminded us of the kind of place Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin would hang out at.  They had a great selection of beers and a full bar with anything you'd possibly ever want or need. We picked a good time to be there (2:30 p.m.) because the manager was demonstrating the finer art of how to make a Lemon Drop and an Old Fashion which we graciously accepted (and gave a great tip for later).  The bar was awesome and the place broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal and even has strategically placed power outlets all down the underside of the bar.  They have a live band every night and have great drink prices too.  After the fact, I stumbled across their web site: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgolddustloungesf.com%2F&amp;s=f2c666b8c75f4dd22910219568ca2710c0ada9f9924ce862c3bff2c95e2c9955\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">golddustloungesf.com</a>  I will most definitely make a return trip on my next time down to Fisherman's Wharf and would highly recommend this place!",

    "review_text": "I lived for a time on Pine at Taylor Street, and the Gold Dust was an ancient touristy dive bar on Powell from my time there. I went there seldomly when I lived near it, because it was always crowded. I would have spent a lot of time there if it had been larger or less crowded - it was my kind of place.  Now I live on a sailboat at Pier 39. The entire area is a tourist wasteland - toxic fish and chips made from breaded seafood slurry and overpriced t-shirt vendors anchored by the Academy of Art and the MUNI Yard. When they first started making noises about moving the Gold Dust to Fisherman's Wharf, I was dubious. The spot was good, but I couldn't see it.   Now that the Gold Dust is opened, I've been a few times and I have to say this - it totally works down here. As a matter of fact, it's one of the coolest venues on Fisherman's Wharf. To be fair, that bar is pretty low - there is nothing very memorable food or entertainment wise on Jefferson Street. That's why it's got 5 stars - it stands out as a gem on the Wharf.   My own complaints are personal and nostalgia related. The ADA rips the soul and charm out of a place. I loved the cramped old bar, but this one is big enough for powered wheelchairs to tool around in - even if the band needs them! The house band is still there and does indeed know just about every song in the world. The bathrooms are spacious and again, ADA compliant. Even behind the bar is... ADA compliant. It's not unwelcome, it's just unexpected when placed against my memories of the old Gold Dust.   So far all the employees have been pretty awesome to me as well, which is good because I can get really drunk and tear a place apart. They can handle drunks too though - I was there on Super Bowl Sunday and saw a lot of crying into multiple beers, which the staff handled with aplomb. As a reminder to myself, I have to tip them more.   And now comes that awkward part where I tell you to stay away. This is my new favorite place. But I don't have to do that, because the mere thought of going into Fisherman's Wharf terrifies you, non-tourist San Franciscan. Stop by occasionally, about as often as you did with the old one on Powell - it's not going anywhere. The \u00a0place may be way bigger but it's always got a crowd every time I've been in there.",

Biggest drawback here is that the only food is pre-made and pulled from a cooler behind the bar. I had a turkey sandwich and was pleased that they use real turkey breast and not processed deli meat, but the sandwich was still average pre-packaged at best. I also had their Key Lime Margarita based on several positive reviews, was pretty good but not something I would brag about. Female bartender was very friendly and made this a very nice experience.  The only thing here that was fantastic was the piano player in the corner. He really made the place stand out as something unique and classy.   Overall, the decor is nice and I love the piano, but the lack of an open kitchen and the roughness of some of the bartenders making this a place I am unlikely to visit again.",

It sounds like from the bartender the Gold Dust is an old landmark, that was evicted from its old space, and now resides on Fisherman's Wharf. \u00a0They recreated the feel of the old bar, and it really does feel like you're stepping back in time. \u00a0Velvet everywhere, bartender in an old school tux vest, and painted ceilings.  They use their own special margartia mix - Lefty O'Douls - and it's delicious. \u00a0They also have other Lefty mixes, like Bloody Marys.

I only had beer, a nice selection of which is available on tap; \u00a0the wine list is a disgrace---but since even with their miserable selection they're in company with almost every bar in the City, and better still than most (have you seen the wine list at the Lush Lounge?) it'd be more surprising if they actually had decent wine. \u00a0 At $6.50 a glass, the prices are right. \u00a0I'd prefer to have the option of paying more for better, or buying half bottles of decent stuff. \u00a0That is not an option.  The Wharf gets more abuse than it deserves. \u00a0The best restaurant in the area remains In n Out, \u00a0there's a great little wine bar in the Cannery (which unfortunately runs in the opposite direction---at $16. to $20. a glass, the wine is great, but who wants to spend that kind of money at a bar?) \u00a0And Normans sells Mitchells Ice Cream, around the corner, despite not having the visibility of Ben and Jerry's and that awful new chain ice-cream joint whose name I can't remember. \u00a0 The Gold Dush Lounge brings a welcome respite of 20th Century pre-foodie bar ambience to the Wharf, and I will look forward to dropping in from time to time.  By the way, as one poster noted, the place is ADA compliant in the worst way, a fat person in a super-sized wheel chair could tend bar; \u00a0but, despite Parisian boulevards for aisles, the place works. \u00a0And the \"F\" line rolls right up to the front door.",

I feel like when it was downtown, it fit in more ... here it's just kind of there. I know that was out of the owner's control ... but still, just a vibe.  The inside of this place is great ... cavernous ... over the top ... it is designed to resemble a saloon from the 1860s, complete with faux globed gas lights and velvet pattered wallpaper. It looks like a cross between Liberace's bedroom and a brothel from the wild west. You could search high and low and you'll probably never see another place like it.  The bar is more modern with big glass refridgerators of beer and a huge flat screen tv with 6 different screens (most of them sports). The front has a piano and the sides are velvet booths.  One thing I HATE about this place is the music. They used to have a great band that did covers of songs from the 1960s - 1980s. The last 3 times I went in they had a pretty bad singer who was on the piano. The piano music was way too loud ... so loud you couldn't have a conversation ... and the weird thing is that they left the cool 1950s music playing on the speakers while he was singing which meant two songs going on at the same time.  Also, when you are drinking in a bar at midnight at Fisherman's Wharf ... you don't want to hear depressing piano versions of slow John Legend songs. The guy was playing very melancholy songs on the piano which were borderline depressing me. It would be one thing if he was banging out some Jerry Lee Lewis music ... but to play depressing, slow songs ... not what I am looking for when I am drinking in a bar with velvet wallpaper and gold mirrored walls.  The bartenders are super nice here ... and will pretty much go out of their way to get you whatever you want. They all seem happy and like they enjoy working there. I got the vibe that everyone is a close knit group, and that's always a good thing for patrons to see. The bouncer was a big 'thuggy' and kind of gruff but on The Wharf, I'm sure he's seen his fair share of shit so he might be battle hardened.  There are less tourists who drink here and more locals. Lack of drink specials and a dark kind of vibe don't always lend itself to the tourist crowd. The bar is immaculately clean ... which must be hard to do because believe it or not, this bar is carpeted!  If not for the piano music, this would be a great place I'd recommend to anyone.

The owners did their best to imitate the atmosphere and for a while, even the menu, of the old place. And for a while, it worked. Or maybe, it was the nostalgia speaking. Granted, the location put it firmly into SF's touristland, as no Sanfranciscan frequences the area unless he or she works in the tacky souvenir and cheap jacket business.   And so the place starts appearing, well, sad. It's huge - far too big for a bar. It's decor looks cheap. The paintings on the walls look fake. But most and foremost, the happy hour as we know it, is gone. I'm not even talking about $4.75 irish coffees and champagnes *during* the happy hour - a far cry from 2.95 and 3.50 that they used to cost at the old place. No, I'm talking about the happy hour ending at 6:30 instead of 8:30 as it has for decades. Now that, is not Gold Dust. That is anti-Gold Dust. And thus, I shall visit this place no more.

This made-to-order gem is only $3.75! \u00a0You can have two for the price of one and still have money to tip.   Some other places, specifically one who claims to have invented the Irish Coffee, charge $9 and they are made 20 at a time. \u00a0  Well Done!",

The crowd is a mix of late 20's/early 30s, and baby boomers.   The decor reminds me of an old Vegas casino, and has plenty of TVs if you want to watch a game. My only real knock against this place was that a staff member was \u00a0rude to me. She also happened to knock over a stool onto me which gave me a gash on my leg, which was not appreciated lol.

With it being 2014 and all I showed the Asian bartender, with thick glasses and a protruding chin, my voucher on my phone and he proceeded to tell me I had to have a printout and they will not honor the electronic one on my phone. He said \"they had meetings regarding this\" like I cared about that.  I was there with friends for a good time and I just did not feel it was the time to argue so I left pretty annoyed.   Dear Gold Dust,  If this is the case your prepaid voucher policy is lousy and honestly against the law. I feel you offered them to generate business where in this case it will cause me to take the option of ever going to your estsblishment off the table for good because my drinking friends \"had a meeting regarding this\".

It gets an A for effort, and it is easily among the best bars in the Wharf in terms of service, people watching and character. \u00a0Still, it is a shadow of its former self--too clean and too nice to live up to its name and reputation.

After an afternoon at the Exploratorium, we decided on an impromptu bar crawl to kill time before our dinner. Based on the reviews, we thought we'd give it a shot; on paper it had the makings of a place we'd like despite being in one of the most touristy parts of town. We were wrong.  I never visited the original Gold Dust Lounge, I think I would have liked it. The new one took obvious pains to recreate the idea of the old Gold Dust and an old saloon feel. They succeeded with the idea of an old place, but failed in terms of feel. I can't put my finger on it, but compared to pictures of the original, it lacks warmth and feels gimmicky. The space is long and narrow; we weren't sure why, but it really felt like there should be a casino attached to it. Behind a bar in the back was a band playing covers.  We came, we saw, we drank.

The place didn't open until 5 pm and it's only about 1:30.  As we perused Yelp listings for a bar, my friend Yvonne suggested the Gold Dust Lounge (we always want to seek out possible dive bars). \u00a0Since the area is full of tourists of every kind (families, foreigners, outliers (people who live away from San Francisco but close enough to drive).  First good sign, no one under 21. \u00a0Of course this is early Sunday afternoon and you will not expect a drunken crowd but we also didn't expect a really clean and obviously remodeled Gold Dust lounge. \u00a0In it's heyday, it might have looked like this, and probably got rundown before getting fixed up again. \u00a0It was not at all crowded with about a half dozen or more people sitting around drinking (some even had pizza - probably ordered outside since the food menu for this bar is minimal).  Another nod that we are now in the modern Gold Dust lounge, availability of plugs, not necessarily for your computer but sometimes your phone suddenly gets battery drain after seeking out spots in the area or getting your Uber ride.  The bartender was fairly nice and not talkative, several tvs (4) showed various sports events (range from tennis to wakeboarding to baseball - i think the owner is an Oakland A's fan not SF Giants but I couldn't see any indication except conversation).  So if you ever find yourself dragged by your family in Pier 39 and Fisherman's wharf where everybody is eating their bread bowl clam chowder in any corner or sidewalk space available, check this place out. \u00a0It might save your sanity from the huge throngs of tourists around.   P.S,. \u00a0The Spicy Bloody Mary was priced right. \u00a0And yes it was spicy but a glass of water is easily available by the bar.",

Supposedly, this is the less touristy location, but it may just be the only drinking establishment open past 11pm. Their drinks are the cheapest you'll find in the area, especially if you're a beer drinker.  The location boasted a deep and very long bar that can comfortably seat what I'd estimate to be 30 people, maybe more. There was only one bartender on staff when we visited, so drink service was slow, but he seemed to be relatively efficient given the short staff at the business.  They have a cocktail menu and I tried the 7th inning stretch, which was a tasteful combination of sweet and bitter. My \"better half\" had a Cosmo, made just like a Cosmo should be made.  If there isn't live music, they have classic songs playing from the 60s and 70s for the most part that add to the interesting theme and ambiance of the business. There was a live pianist when we visited that was very talented, and was very fun for a sing-a-long.  The sloppy drunk woman with uncontrollable limbs that were constantly pounding at my back took away from our experience. Her ability to continually obtain negative attention ultimately ended our time of stay for the evening. Both my fianc\u00e9e and I said we would have stayed longer, but were at our maximum threshold for watching a drunk, annoying, self-centered, half-dressed woman placing her every effort toward obtaining attention (but maybe that's your \"thing,\" who am I to judge?). \u00a0I'm hoping she was eventually \"cut off,\" which is the only action a bar can take if they notice this behavior.  The clientele aside, this is a nice, fun stop. They were the only place with any late hours around, so it's \"the place\" for a nightcap on your stroll back to your hotel. Drinks are cheaper than elsewhere, so you may not need that second mortgage for your second cocktail.",

The cocktail list has all the basics, but is a bit expensive. Can't complain about beer selection. Wine is alright if you aren't particular. If you hear/see the live band performing, run. While performing, the singer likes to walk around, get friendly, and even hand over the microphone (which I've witnessed twice and both times the person he chose didn't even know the song).   The ONLY reason I'm giving the new location two \u00a0stars is aesthetics. The near perfect replication of the old place down to the outside window, and the waitresses make the place easy on the eyes, especially compared to the nightmareish display Ripley's puts on next door.   The Parlor is a couple blocks down the street. Just saying.",

    "review_text": "Ok, guilty pleasure perhaps, but I really, really love this place! It's in the middle of \"tourist central\", so that probably turns a lot of the locals off straight away. If it's any consolation, the original bar was downtown, but they were forced out by a major retailer. The drinks aren't great, it's basically what you'd expect from a dive bar (not that this place is a dive bar, just similar style of drinks -- maybe just \"simple\" is the best way to explain it?). For instance, if you get a Bloody Mary (which is on special for Happy Hour), you get vodka... And BM mix... perhaps a cocktail onion or two if you're lucky. Anyhow, the music is fun (80s/90s classic rock), and they even have live entertainment from time to time. Not amazing talent, but fun. Notice the theme yet?  So, naturally, whenever I have guests in the city, I bring them here. First, it's nice and close to Fisherman's Wharf (like it or not, you'll end up there if you have guests in the city), and it's--yep, you guessed it--fun!  So, last time I was there, with my guests, I met the owner, Casey. Extremely nice man! In fact, he bought us a couple of shots to thank us for the business, and bringing new people to his bar. It's not the free drinks that make this awesome (although that sure was nice), it's the fact that he cares about his customers, and appreciates us bringing others. Just thought that was really cool, and will definitely cause me to keep coming back, and to keep bringing others.   So, you should go!! Oh, and did I mention everything inside is SOLID GOLD?!",

    "review_text": "For the record, I'm a local, not a tourist. \u00a0I read all those articles that plastered the San Francisco Chronicle back when the Gold Dust Lounge was being forced to relocate from its former home on Union Square, and had promised myself that I would go check it out in its new location...and I have, several times previous to this particular occasion.  But after this last experience? \u00a0I won't be back.  As anyone who lives in a wheelchair or with some disability is all too well-aware, it is NEVER acceptable for someone to move your person or your mobility-assistance devices without your permission. \u00a0The latter, whether it's your wheelchair or scooter, \u00a0or a cane or oxygen tank, are to be considered as extensions of your body, or at the very least, your precious property.  This can also be dangerous for the person who requires said equipment in order to properly function, as able-bodied people often don't know any better and can damage your precious (and often expensive to repair) gear!  So imagine my horror when the manager and bouncer decided it was appropriate to start moving my motorized scooter without my consent!! \u00a0Because they didn't know how to operate it, they just brutally shoved at it, nevermind that it wasn't moving easily because the breaks were locked...the breaks that I'd just recently had repaired and didn't want to have broken again!!! \u00a0We asked them to stop, but the manager just waived his hand dismissively, told us it wasn't a big deal (IT WAS A BIG DEAL, IDIOT!!!!), and continued to aggressively shove my vehicle where he decided he wanted it to go, which meant that it was now blocking their ATM machine, ie, putting it directly in front of a destination for drunk people who will now need to awkwardly stumble over my scooter to use said ATM.  I was aghast. \u00a0These two jokers could have broken my breaks doing what they did, and that would've cost a LOT of money to fix, meant I'd have to be without my scooter for several days during which it was being repaired, and inconvenienced me terribly...all because they couldn't just politely ASK me to move it myself!  It could've also been a potentially dangerous situation: \u00a0I need those breaks to work because I live in San Francisco, and if y'all have noticed, there are a LOT of hills here! \u00a0Those breaks keep me from tumbling to my death!! \u00a0So because these two dolts decided it was more convenient for them to manhandle my gear than let me handle it, they put my life potentially in harm's way!!!  Maybe this sounds overly dramatic to you. \u00a0Let me assure you that it isn't. \u00a0My breaks went out almost a year ago on a hill, leaving my vehicle to roll backwards, gaining speed, until I intentionally stopped my fall by hitting a tree. \u00a0I was in pain for weeks afterwards, although I \u00a0was pretty lucky, considering how bad it could've been.  This is why it's so imperative that people respect my mobility device, and those owned by any other disabled person. \u00a0These gadgets aren't \"fun\" for us, they are our legs. \u00a0This is our LIVES.  After this occurred, I was so angry, I no longer wanted my drink. \u00a0My partner and I just left. \u00a0On the way out, I told off the bouncer, who, rather than apologize, just said, hey, it wasn't HIS fault, he was just obeying orders from the manager. \u00a0So I told him to tell the manager what I told him. \u00a0  I doubt he did.  Safe to say, I won't be back here. \u00a0I don't feel respected or like my physical safety is cared about by this business. \u00a0Given all the other dive-y aspects of this touristy bar, I would much rather go somewhere where my safety, autonomy, and business is appreciated. \u00a0San Francisco is a BIG city, there are TONS of really great bars. \u00a0I'll be taking my business and that of my guests to one of them.",

The have $3.75 Happy Hour deals for Irish Coffee, Champagne, and Key Lime Margaritas- we only tried the Irish Coffee which was pretty good, although not as good as Buena Vista's. They also have a variety of scotches/whiskies/bourbons to choose from as well as a fully stocked bar, and plenty of beers on tap. The service can be a little slow if a lot of people are ordering at the same time, but the female bartender was really nice and helpful. They also have a live piano player on Thursday nights, which brings more of a jazzy vibe to the place.   If you're looking to grab a quick drink while in the Fisherman's Wharf area, definitely check out Gold Dust Lounge. There are stools available at the bar, and also booths against the wall. Make sure you check in on Yelp to get $1 off your 16 oz. draft beer! Parking is easy to find on the weekday nights, but can be difficult on the weekends.",

The Gold Dust Lounge really seemed out of place next to souvenir shops and seafood restaurants however it quickly caught my attention when they advertised a Key Lime Margarita for only $3.75, and after a busy day I decided that this was the perfect place to stop for a quick drink to help refuel. The interior is surprisingly upscale with a casual feel yet it almost reminded me of an old school Vegas bar. As far as the service goes here it was great, the bartender was nice, and offered friendly conversation while we enjoyed the reasonably priced drink special. The Key Lime Margarita was pretty good, too.",

I was shocked didn't finish my drink but quickly got out of there...
