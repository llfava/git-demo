With many sportsbar in the city being filled to capacity everytime with huge sporting events, this place is no exceptions. \u00a0  With the bar being overly-crowded, we finally got our drinks. Niece ordered a pair of Long-Island Iced Tea for herself. She decided to get two drinks all at once, because she doesn't want to deal with the hassle of getting the attention of the overworked bartenders who is assisting others. The bartender did a good job on her cocktails, because it was so strong and tasty for $7.00. After the two drinks, you have a idea on her \"Happy\" mood. Matt ordered a bottle Henry Weinhard Rootbeer. The $3.50 drink tasted good, and complimented well with the free peanuts in the shell.   After we left, the facility is full of trash and empty peanut shells among other debris. We might come here again on a quiet weeknight and try the food, in which is upon our interest in the future. The food has names after celebrities and athletes; which is cool.",

Right, you heard me, whether my teams win or lose is TOTALLY based on where I'm watching their games. Recognize.  Anyhow, Knuckles isn't bad for a bar located in Fisherman's Wharf (shudder) attached to a hotel (double shudder):  Cons-- food's at best pedestrian; the drinks are sort of average in pricing; and there's lots of tourists going in and out.   Pros-- there's lots of TV's; the staff is pretty friendly and forthcoming about finding your game; they really don't pressure you to keep ordering even if you're there for three hours and only sucking down diet cokes and one plate of nachos; and the bar has full windows, which makes the sunny room a nice change from the usual sports bar caves.   So, if you don't want much more than alcohol, greasy food and a decent selection of televisions Knuckles is a reasonable option to work into your sports bar rotation.",

One note- If \u00a0you love nachos like me, then do NOT order them at Knuckles. \u00a0  Strike One- They do not use real cheese. And, while I know many a nacho lover likes that, I prefer real cheese.  Strike Two- The top had almost no cheese. So, I just assumed they weren't generous with it. When we got to the bottom, we discovered a pool of cheese. It literally looked like they put the cheese in and then piled everything on top. Odd choice considering a nacho is eaten from top to bottom.  Strike Three: The chicken on the nachos was inedible. \u00a0I ate one piece of chicken on my first bite and picked it off of every other bite that I ate. \u00a0It was straight gross. I said nothing to my boyfriend, then he said \"This chicken tastes off?\" He kept saying it tasted like it was old and had been sitting out. \u00a0  I'd say go for happy hour drinks, but stick to all the other delicious food options the city has to offer. We ate at so many other amazing restaurants, we kind of kicked ourselves for wasting stomach space on pretty average food here.",

    "review_text": "In 1920, when H.L. Mencken was in San Francisco to cover the Democratic Convention, he remarked something to the effect ' we felt we had escaped America'. \u00a0 As I took a seat at Knuckles, after a bit of a walk on a warm day, at happy hour, I had the sense that America knew where I was, had been following me, and wouldn't let me go. \u00a0 It was that corporate. \u00a0And yet, given the resources of Corporations, it turned out to be rather thin, and not at all well done. \u00a0Why?  This sports bar used to advertise itself as \"historic\", in reference to an earlier phase as a warehouse, where the granite and marble that was shipped to town in 1914 was stored, prior to being piled up in what we now know as City Hall. \u00a0One should not expect that any of that imperial grandeur was left behind, it was not. \u00a0Although, the brick walls have a certain attraction, as bricks always do.  The joint is furnished in what is known as \"contemporary\", with wood to give it warmth and substance, and lots of shiny-shiny to keep it looking clean; it's neither modern nor possessed of any character that comes with age. \u00a0 One wall, over the bar, is lined with large flat screens, all of which are set to sports stations of the sort that never seem to show any real games, or programs, just snippets of games and talking heads, talking. \u00a0WIth the sound turned off, mercifully, although I noticed that you can rent a little box that will allow you to listen at your table.  It was happy hour, which is why we went in, and figuring (correctly) that the wine selection wasn't going to be impressive, I ordered the red, and was told they were out, but I could get Kendall Jackson and some other label for the same price. \u00a0 When the bartender, a nice and funny gent, went off to get it, the Partner pointed out that the wine they were out of lined the top two shelves above the tvs, and seeing the label, I noticed there was an open bottle of the same, with the rest of the open wine bottles behind the bar. \u00a0 Hmmm. \u00a0I didn't pursue it.  The Partner had Anchor Steam, which I'm delighted to say tasted just like Anchor Steam. \u00a0My Kendall Jackson Cab was appropos to the bar, being a bit sweet, rather light, and not at all complex or interesting.  I ordered an Angus Slider and I would like to think that the rest of the cow went to some fine dining establishment, well aged and served in an exquisite preparation. \u00a0 As burgers go it was O-Kay. \u00a0 The fries on the other hand, long and thin, like Pomme Frites, were excellent, some of the best I've had, anywhere. \u00a0The Partner ordered the stuffed mushrooms which came in the dish in which it was microwaved. \u00a0 The alarmingly orange sauce had apparently been left in long enough to reach a boiling frenzy, reduce itself by half, and to have splattered the rest of the dish, leaving a thick high water mark and splatters all about. \u00a0Presentation: \u00a0Nil. \u00a0 The Partner didn't seem to impressed with the flavors, I didn't even bother.  All in all, it was not what I was expecting. \u00a0 Frightfully suburban, mall like, very Corporate, yet utterly lacking just the same. \u00a0I've eaten in Suburbia---at a place that reminds me of this one, actually, but better done, in Burlingame. \u00a0   So, I did it, you can say you did, and head off to some much better bar, of which there are quite a few nearby.",

So instead we ate here and just missed the breakfast window but did have the option of the breakfast buffet, but we weren't left with too much time as it was drawing near to closing it down. Two fails in a row.  We stayed and just ordered lunch. We went for the crab sandwich and the chorizo pizza. I loved the pizza because it had good veggies with feta and I love arugula on pizza. I'm not a big chorizo lover, it's too salty for me so I only ate two or three pieces of it per slice. If you love the meat you will be pleased because there was a lot of it. My fianc\u00e9 absolutely loved the pizza. The pizza alone would have him rate Knuckles four stars.  I personally liked the crab sandwich better. At first bite I wasn't feeling it, tasted really plain and boring but the second bite where I got deeper in the middle where all the good toppings were made me really enjoy it. It wasn't as crabby in flavor as I was expecting but it was still good. The side of fries it came with were really good too. It has that similar crunch on the outside and softness on the inside like Burger King fries, but better.  The iced tea was really nice. It had a subtle flavor of passion fruit or something.

The sweet potato fries for example don't even have sea salt - this is Fisherman's Warf; 2 blocks from the ocean....  What I was not impressed about is when the bill came they charged us $5 per piece of cornbread even though I sent all 3 pieces back! For the portion I would expect no more than $1.50 a slice.  San Francisco is full of amazing locally owned and operated restaurants where the servers and chef's care about the patrons and have passion. This place is a Hyatt hotel bar and does not live up to the Hyatt name. Stick to local options. After the service here I will think twice about ever staying at a Hyatt hotel again.",

I just wanted them to know and to tell the chef, but she, on her own accord, gave me $4 off each lunch combo.  2. On the Wharf.  3. Emptyish (not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing). Seating is abundant.  CONS: 1. Icky salad! I ordered a lunch combo with half a veggie wrap, the chowder, and mixed green salad. The salad was seriously wilted and very, very brown. Like it was old, reused, and/or had been sitting out on the counter for a day. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't even touch it. I didn't have a bite at all.

It was game 5 of the MLB playoffs with Detroit and the Yankees mixing it up so off we went to watch the game. It sucks the Giants aren't in it but that doesn't mean I can't root against the evil empire.  Some sports bars only have a few TV's and if you don't get there early you have to deal with a sore neck or looking around and over people. That is never a problem at Knucks. They have a nice wall of TV's over the bar and then smaller ones placed around the tables on posts.   I have had good, bad, and ugly service here which is why it rates a solid 3 stars. The food has been decent to good as well. This last visit was straight up beers and appetizers to go with some raucous cheering. With so many TV's even when it gets crowded people spread out a bit so you get some breathing room. Great place!",

And they had a bar...and I was really craving a bloody mary.  Let me just go straight to the summary: \u00a0A sports bar atmosphere; decent food; terrible service  Atmosphere: With TVs covering almost every square inch, it was a little distracting for a meal with family and friends; eyes wandering everywhere.  Food: Not bad; but expensive (especially the buffet - yikes!). My egg white frittata with spinach and salmon was decent. \u00a0The kids liked their pancakes.  Service: \u00a0Waitress was late to arrive at our table; she mixed up the juice orders, forgot waters, forgot some juices, accidentally served my juice in a kids' cup, mixed up our food orders; and she delivered our food to the table over an extended period - not all at once. \u00a0  But the most annoying snafu was she forgot my bloody mary altogether, even though we had a conversation about the spice level. Plus: \u00a0she forgot that she forgot. By the time I could get her attention again, the meal was 90% over. At that point we were ready to kick-start the long process for paying the bill. (At least I was never charged for the drink).  In short, a three star spot. \u00a0But when they blithely forgot the one thing I was craving all morning, I am not filled with generosity in my rating.",

Point the Second: \u00a0I've never eaten here, but I have got my drank on on several occasions.  My brother, Bachagalupe, who ordinarily has impeccable taste when it comes to watering holes, for some inexplicable reason loves this place, which is the only reason that I know anything about it.   It is somewhat ironic, I suppose, that I don't really care for Knuckles in spite of the fact that I've had some killer times here. \u00a0For example, the last time I was there was for Bachagalupe's birthday. \u00a0Weezer and I were commenting upon the big fake jugs that one of the women in our party (whom we had just met) was sporting. \u00a0I also observed, in my capacity as an amateur plastic surgeon, that there was a very good chance that she had undergone a major rhinoplasty at some point in the past. \u00a0Weezer commented, \"For all we know, she may have started out as a guy.\" \u00a0  Be advised that the acoustics in Knuckles can be a bit tricky in the sense that although it was noisy as hell and the woman in question was a good ten feet away and facing away from us and engaged in conversation with someone else, she immediately spun on her heels, glared at us and yelled, \"YOU THINK I'M A GUY?!?!?!?! \u00a0YOU THINK I'M A GUY?!?!?!?!\" Whereupon she marched up to us, grabbed Weezer's hand, and unceremoniously stuffed it down the front of her pants. \u00a0\"There,\" she said, \"do you still think I'm a guy?!?!\" \u00a0  Weezer, a master of thinking on his feet and who used to gamble for a living said, \"Well, probably not, but you could have things neatly tucked away. \u00a0Have you ever seen 'The Silence of the Lambs'?\"  \"Here,\" she replied, grabbing his hand anew and thrusting it down her pants a second time. \"Make sure.\" \u00a0(You know you want to roll with my crew.)  Weezer rummaged around until fully satisfied that nothing untoward (like, say for instance, a snake in the grass) was lurking in her trousers.  \"Okay,\" said Weezer, \"You pass.\"  \"Good,\" said the broad in question. \u00a0\"Now, I better not catch you sniffing your fingers.\" With that she stomped off in a histrionic huff.  Weezer and I, of course, immediately repaired to a quiet corner where we could sniff his fingers to our hearts' content.  Now that I think about it, that story alone is worth an extra star.",

I was staying in the Wharf very recently and decided to give the Knuckles a chance at the Hyatt in the Wharf. I was floored by the difference in both restaurants. The one in Monterey has a college feel with Peanut shell husks, and self-serve Popcorn at the bar entrance. Not to mention that all the used husks were thrown on the floor. The Monterey one also has a couple of Pool tables and a couple of Video games. The bar has a lot of Taps of Beer and a College bar type of atmosphere. So when I went into the one in S.F., I was floored. The restaurant looked elegant and trendy. The places did have a lot of T.v.'s, but were strategically located throughout the restaurant. The other one in Monterey had a lot of T.v\"s as well, but had a Sports bar like feel, because they have the ESPN theme with a bunch of monitors bunched around into a Cube-like single-screen. The Wharf Knuckles had reasonable prices and more of a Sports bar feel without out all the College like feel. I ordered the English Club minus the fried-egg. My wife ordered Pulled-Pork sliders and the Spinach dip appetizer. The little one had the Corn Chowder with Kid's Spaghetti. The appetizer was served with toasted Pita bread with Fresh Vegetables . (Broccoli, Carrots) My English Club was served with Dijon mustard and French Fries. The Fries were crispy and hot. I also ordered a Cobbler with ice cream to go. The server said there were no nuts, but there was a mountain of Walnuts in the dessert. Not too good if you have a nut allergy. All in all, good experience at a modest price. I will go there when my team plays an away game. Go Niners!!",

The beer was a good deal and kept on coming. The food was typical hotel/bar food: freshly defrosted American food. The ambiance is very hotel bar and fake looking, but man there are a ton of TVs and private booths for large groups.",

    "review_text": "We stayed at the Hyatt Fishermans Wharf and Knuckles is attached to it, so our first day there we ate dinner here + ordered room service breakfast from them the next day.   The place is actually pretty cute. Brick, open, lots of windows so it is light and bright. There are booths with their own TVs along the wall, a fairly big bar and tables that pepper the rest of the place. All in all a nice feel.   We ate at kind of an off time for lunch/dinner (3p) so not sure if what we had was the lunch menu or dinner menu (or if they are different). However, the hubby had a burger, I had a chicken sandwich and we shared potato skins. All in all the food was good, although extremely basic. We hadn't eaten since like 6a that morning so it all tasted awesome, but then again we were really hungry! I can't think of one thing that stands out now.   Biggest complaint was the cost of it all. I know it was a hotel restaurant and it was near the wharf - so what do I expect? Still it was steep for what we ate/drank. Like a $70/bill for a couple sandwiches and beers.   Oh and breakfast, the next day rocked. Try the zucchini &amp; cheese frittata - it had was so rich and packed with goat cheese and veggies I couldn't get enough. Of course, our two breakfasts cost us $47!   It was a decent place and convenient for us since we were in the hotel, but a bit pricey for what it is.",

Looking for a place to get a drink and maybe dinner, my bf said he noticed Knuckles at the Wharf while walking to his inside the Hyatt. It was raining like crazy that evening and it was a nice haven from the dodgy place my bf was staying at.   To share we started off with the Knuckles Nachos with chicken. A massive plate of nachos topped with black beans, cheese, guac, salsa, sour cream, and jalapenos. We so did not know the amount food we were going to get. But it was definitely worth the order. However, this \"small bite\" was so not small that when we got our entree of Fish and Chips, we could barely finish it all.   The service here was quite attentive and the restaurant did not seem like it was attached to the hotel. However, the only downfall was that late in the evening, I was surprised that the hosts would sit families so close to the bar. I felt like I had to censor myself when a family of four sat down next to us then ended up switching tables because of the conversations around them that were occurring at the bar. Not like it was x-rated or anything, but I know I was sailor-trucking in my conversation with my bf.   I would like to give this place another go next time where in that area of the City.",

This review is on behalf of my significant other, he doesn't have a Yelp account, so here it goes:  He and his friend came here a few weeks back to watch a Warriors game, they walked in and weren't greeted/seated for a full 5 minutes in a very empty restaurant. (That's a realllly long time!) Minus 1 star  They were finally seated but weren't given menus or a server for a full TEN minutes, significant other had to get up and FIND menus to bring back to the table. Minus 1 star.  The only TV playing the warriors game was too far for them to see, so they got up to ask another server if they could either change the channel on the TV closest to them, or move. \u00a0The server just looked at them and shrugged (WTF?) and walked away. \u00a0Ooookkkk...so they go and ask another server and apparently only 1 TV in the entire place plays the Warrior's game (what?) and won't let them move. Minus 1 star.  They finally order some bacon nachos, or something along those lines, because apparently some other menu items they were looking at couldn't be placed for order. Oi vey. \u00a0The nachos come absolutely cold, cold to the point that the cheese had that weird \"I've been sitting out for too long, and I'm not greasy anymore\" glaze. The chips were completely stale and rubbery, and to add insult to injury..there was NO bacon-the only thing they were looking forward to. Minus 1 star.  The check NEVER came, and they had to get up and retrieve it from the bar area. Minus 1 star.  So, as you can see, this place actually deserved 0 to negative stars, but Yelp doesn't have that feature...Yet. \u00a0Hopefully after seeing reviews like these, Yelp will reconsider.",

I go here with my sister otherwise I wouldn't come here at all now it's so bad. To make things worst (from a personal viewpoint), she purchased some online discount coupons for this place! She agrees all the stuff is terrible now, and the place is almost empty every time we walk in now - no wonder, and they probably haven't got a clue (or even care!). When I told my sister today that I will NOT walk in to that restaurant, she asked if I could hold off till she uses all those coupons she has. YECK!!! Do not walk in - it's overpriced, and the food is terrible!! Whoever made the decision to change everything should be fired, and I'll bet the manager has NO idea why everyone is staying away! They should try their own food to find out why ~ I ordered a crab and clam chowder which was served in a bread bowl. That bowl was toasted and STILL stale! The soup itself had a lot of ingredients BUT I did not taste even one crab meat or little tiny clam, plus it was so salted it would have choked a sailor!! Hold it, I was a navy sailor and I choked!!

Service was friendly, but dreadfully lacking and requiring one to flag down your server, someone else's server, the floor manager, or whomever for practically every little thing. \u00a0I'm not sure if it is the bar or the kitchen that is keeping the servers off the floor, but they all seem to be affected and every table I saw had to perform the same flagging.

That leads to another positive, they have a ton of TVs so you can probably see your game no matter where you sit. Third positive is they have a few ok Happy Hour specials, I believe it was 5 dollar appetizers (wings, nachos, etc) and some drink deals I thought were average for the areas. So why just two stars?  Well the service is just bizarre, I would describe it as confused indifference. I couldn't tell who was our waiter as it seemingly changed every few minutes. It would take ten minutes to get a beer at some points, than a random woman would rush over and fill up the water. The food also kind of blows. My girlfriend got the nachos and I don't know what the hell they were made of. I am fairly confident it wasn't cheese. Some sort of weird imitation goo that was confined to about 5 of the 25 chips. Maybe they put a lot less effort into it cause it was happy hour, but man, that was bad. Also, their prices for non-happy hour kind of suck. I get it is attached to a hotel and near fisherman's wharf and does good business, so there is no reason for them to change them. However, it does mean people that live in the city (and visitors that use yelp) can find bars with better food, drinks and prices. If you are stuck down here or really want to find a place you can hear the sound for an obscure terrible game (I'm looking at you Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins fans) maybe its worth coming to. Otherwise yelp it up and head elsewhere",

I set the bar more than a little bit higher when I dine at any Hyatt, and at this particular restaurant, the bar could not have been set lower.  Inattentive wait staff, even worse management (left our table in the middle of an order to talk to another customer and never returned), dirty and sticky floors, and confused bartenders (served me a mojito with little to no ice and a mint julep with gin).  Mind you, this is based on 3 separate visits.  Service is what earns this place a 0/5. The food squeeks by at a 4. Averages out to 2.  Burgers are the standard burger served on all Hyatt menus. Generous in portion size but severely lacking in flavour. Produce is fresh and side spreads are pleasant. The meat itself is what makes a burger great and this burger has only one thing going for it: Consistency. Consistently bland and unimpressive but always filling. Not the best $15 burger I've ever had.  Nachos with steak added were FABULOUS! Tender steak, rich cheese, flavorful chili, and crisp chips. I would order these again.  Crab Cakes were large but much like the burger, entirely unimpressive. I will say that they are not cheating you on crab meat. There's plenty of that in these guys, but they've managed to dilute the flavour and dry out the sweet and moist nature of the crab by over cooking. Sad.  Cobb salad was large and very tasty. Fresh lettuce and generous amounts of cheese, bacon, and avocado.  Other items ordered through room service were the omelet, pancakes, and buffalo wings. All very standard in terms of Hyatt room service. Not bad at all. The wings are a favourite of mine.  Would I return to the hotel? Probably. Why not? Not the best but definitely one of the most conveniently located.  Would I return to the restaurant? No.",

    "review_text": "We used this restaurant several times over the course of a week - it was attached to the hotel we were staying in, so it was convenient.  However, in terms of price vs. quality, I just simply can't give Knuckles a good rating. \u00a0I think out of the 5 meals we ate together for (2 breakfasts, one lunch, 2 dinners), we left satisfied just the first time (breakfast). \u00a0If we'd had the same experience as our later visits on that first meal, we likely wouldn't have even come back.  Much like other restaurants I visited while in San Francisco, Knuckles has the trappings of a \"high class\" restaurant (big, real wood tables, nice carpets &amp; flooring, a large bar, finely-dressed wait staff, etc), but just fails to deliver once it comes time to actually consume food.  Portions were pretty reasonable (big omelets, reasonable-sized pizza for 2, lots of fries), but overall taste was bland. \u00a0We tried the Parmesan-garlic fries the first time we needed a side, and quickly decided we wouldn't finish the plate or get more. \u00a0The next time we needed a side, we ordered the sweet potato fries. \u00a0They weren't sweet, and they tasted old. \u00a0How do you take the sweet out of sweet potatoes? \u00a0They were also served just with ketchup, and the restaurant had a hard time understanding my request for something else, like a spicy or honey mustard, either of which would be more traditional with sweet potatoe fries than ketchup.  Our first meal there, we ordered the full breakfast buffet ($20 each), and had a mostly satisfactory experience. \u00a0The omelet I had was not only big, but it was good (though they messed up the ingredients I requested, I just attributed that to a language barrier, and either way, it was still good). \u00a0The fresh-squeezed orange juice tasted fresh-squeezed. \u00a0The pancakes were pretty good (though not amazing), the bacon was pretty good (but mostly well-done, and I prefer a little more chew to bacon), and the eggs were pretty good (but didn't have a lot of taste, but on the other hand, I usually like to just put some cheese on eggs, not season them too much, and there was a nice block of real cheese you could shave off yourself, which worked). \u00a0   All four meals after that though just kept going downhill. \u00a0My wife was very disappointed in their clam chowder, which upset her stomach that evening as well. \u00a0They gave me a lot of difficulty when I wanted to change one of the ingredients on the chicken sandwich (I just don't like like pesto generally, and just wanted to know if they could throw on a dollop of spicy mustard - this would not normally be a big deal at any restaurant, but it was here).  The smoothies tasted like those packets of smoothie powder mixed with yogurt &amp; milk. \u00a0We're pretty sure there was no real fruit in the smoothie.  I will say, the best food I had all week came from this restaurant - it was a huge, buttered, grilled cheese sandwich made with thick slices of buttered sourdough, and some really great white cheddar. \u00a0However, it was the same meal where we had the really lame Parmesan-garlic fries, so that unfortunately affected our opinion on the meal over all.  Basically, if the first meal hadn't been so good, and also it hadn't been a matter of convenience during a work week, we would not have eaten here as often as we did, and we certainly wouldn't choose to eat here if were had been staying at another hotel.",

Best part: many many TVs and even a separate smaller room with pool table and tv(I snuck in here to watch the Seahawks game). They post the weekly NFL schedules so you will be able to find your game or favorite team playing, along with groups of team supporters or out of towners.  Service can be a bit slow during these peak times, so sometimes it's a good idea to know what you want, rather than tell them you need a few minutes. They'll be back many minutes later.  My big negative: parking is a pain. Unless you park early on a Sunday, be prepared to shell out big bucks as it's near Fisherman's wharf and parking is expensive. $20 to park for a few hours is ridiculous which is why I take the BART then the Muni street car over.

We walk in and the place looks nice, my first thought? Food should be good but may be a bit pricey.  Looking around we see one couple, it is around 2pm and we're after a late lunch so it shouldn't be too busy.  Five of us order our food, wait and talk. A family of three comes in, orders and waits as well. \u00a0Bit of time goes by and the family of three gets their meals served and begins eating. Bit more time and we get ours. The family of three finishes and leaves before we finish.  And the food? \u00a0It was good. It's what to be expected from a nice looking place. But... The orders came out wrong. Our server seemed to have mixed parts of orders up with each of ours. And she was even writing it all down! \u00a0Two of us sitting on the end ordered the \"build a burger\" plate and ended up with a mixture of each other's order. Another asked for sweet potato fries instead of regular and ended up with the regular. \u00a0Drinks were not filled or topped off unless asked.  I would have understood the \u00a0errors if it were busy or we ordered complex custom meals... But we didn't and it the five of us made up half the customers at the time.",

They used romaine lettuce and dressing was a fresh mustard vinegarette. \u00a0 Decent and I did enjoy it. \u00a0Service was off-hand at best. \u00a0  Nachos - a big pile of goop, low quality chips and just uninspired in any way, execution or content.   Petrale sole and mashed potatoes - downright unappetizing, smelled extremely fishy and my husband did not like any of it.   Breakfast - RUN! Don't go here. Tasteless and awful. Even the fruit was not ripe. I ordered eggs basted and they were actually filled with water! \u00a0Waited 15 minutes after asking for a coffee refill and water.   Everyone is correct, the service is propably the worst I've seen in a while. These people are clueless. \u00a0Very inexperienced and do NOT act happy to be helping/waiting on you. \u00a0Exception is the nice hostess at the front.   Positives are - the decor is very cool, typical Hyatt...very classy but mod. \u00a0Love the room the restaurant is in - very light and open, beautiful.  It is a crime to be in San Franscico and eat here for anything other than late lunch or desperation.",

All I saw was a big baseball on a sign, and I think we walked all the way around the block to find it. It is in the Hyatt (I think), this place is really cool. We were there like at 1pm and their happy hour does not start until 4pm...just like most places in SF. My wife and I had 2-3 beers each and they were $5.00 each. Not bad for a hotel bar close to Fisherman's Wharf. Rick the bartender said happy hour was half off which would have been really cool if we stopped by later. Rick was really cool. We were close to the only people in the bar at that time and he talked to us for like an hour. We talked about us being on vacation and going to the baseball game the next day. He told stories of when he used to smoke (cigarettes) and other cool bars to go to close to our hotel. There were TVs all over that place and it looked like even the booths had their own TV that you can change the channel.  When we were about to leave, we mentioned were we could get a good bottle of Cali wine to bring home as a gift and he not only told of us of a few places but he also gave us a few things from the bar, like small key chains, a beer bucket (which came in handy as we picked up gifts for everyone) and a few other things he had laying around. I think he was the best and coolest bartender we had while in SF. We will definitely be back when we are in town.",

And it tasted watered down.  Food and service weren't much better- our server, Boris, did not clear a plate or cup from our table for over three hours, nor did he refill any water glasses at the table until specifically asked to do so. Flagging him down to place orders took an average of 15 minutes.  Fish and chips with garlic fries was decent. The mussels appetizer had a great white wine sauce, but was inexplicably served with several pieces of toast- what on earth is that about? Last order, the buffalo chicken pizza, was a total waste- chicken appeared to be microwaved frozen popcorn style, but there was no \"buffalo\" anything to be found on the cracker like crust. Bland at best.   Wont return or recommend bar or hotel largely due to lack of quality and customer service, not to mention deplorable bathroom conditions.",

    "review_text": "We went here 2x last weekend. \u00a0Once one a Friday night and then on Super Bowl Sunday 2013... Friday was meh and Sunday was a blast! \u00a0Here is my mixed review...  LOCATION &amp; AMBIANCE: \u00a0The bar is connected to the Hyatt, so there was many tourists (I'm guessing, but also have met with many). \u00a0The restaurant/bar has two entrances, one from the outside and one to the hotel. \u00a0The bathroom is in the hotel lobby, just outside of the entrance to the restaurant. \u00a0There is a wine bar on the way to the hotel as well. \u00a0On a Friday night, it was empty. \u00a0On Super Bowl Sunday, it was packed and the crowd got hyped (in part due to my husband's yelling and getting the crowd going haha). \u00a0There are a lot of TV's around the place... see my notes on service though with our experience of the 2nd TV in our booth. \u00a0And booths, there are a few of them, but not a lot.  SERVICE: \u00a0I'd like to note that because Knuckles was at our hotel (the Hyatt) and because we pre-planned our trip to SF back in October, we intended to watch the Super Bowl here no matter what. \u00a0I even emailed the concierge for the hotel to attempt a reservation, but never got a reply. \u00a0The day after the 49'ers won the division to make it to the super bowl, we called directly (# from Yelp is correct, not on the website for the hotel/restaurant, FYI!) and I got hooked up with Jennifer Goodson, who began coordinating with us immediately. \u00a0She was great in ensuring we got a table large enough for our group and even took pictures of the booth we reserved for the game. \u00a0(We had a group of 9-11 people and she wanted to ensure we knew the space we'd have.) \u00a0Before I disucss Sunday, I'd like to briefly mention my Friday experience, when I called down from my hotel room to discuss food and they said I had 7 minutes to order; less than 5 minutes later, I called down for to go and they didn't answer. \u00a0We got downstairs at 11:01 pm and was told by the bartender the kitchen staff \"wouldn't even serve food to their own mothers at this time.\" \u00a0So, he made a recommendation and we prepared on our way. \u00a0As I passed the booth I knew we'd have, I asked the server if I could ask a question and he responded \"you just did.\" \u00a0Hmph... I asked another one anyway. ;-) \u00a0Then to Sunday... Since Jennifer did say there were two TV's and I saw them Friday, I felt fine with our booth. \u00a0Unfortunately, upon arrival, they didn't have the 2nd going and two employees made brief attempts to make one work, but then quickly gave up. \u00a0It wasn't until into the 2nd half of the football game that I met Jennifer and she began getting others on to it... 5 people/attempts later, it finally was going which made the experience WAY BETTER. \u00a0(Previous to that, half of us were stretching our necks to watch or viewing it backwards through the mirror.) \u00a0Now, our server was Boris and I thought he was just OK, getting the job done. \u00a0He was super busy though, and I do realize that could have contributed to the attention he gave us (or lack thereof, especially initially), but he also asked us not to allow other staff (who came to our table) take our orders. \u00a0It was a little odd. \u00a0We did comply though and let others fill water or take plates, but not take orders. \u00a0I'd add that my husband said he enjoyed Boris as our server and got his dry humor; so I can't dock him too much, but I thought that was weird. \u00a0And we realized later he was the same guy from Friday night who said \"you just did.\" \u00a0I'd also like to add that there was another employee, Joana (pronounced Jo-Wanna, not Jo-Anna), who was very nice and helpful. \u00a0We thought she was great.  FOOD &amp; DRINKS: \u00a0They have a full bar and had pitchers around $20 each, so that was good. \u00a0They ran out of the Magners after I ordered my 1st one and then didn't have any Angry Orchard, despite having an ad for it on the table. \u00a0Kind of a bummer on my birthday, but whateh. \u00a0The cocktails were mixed well and that worked for our post-game, end of the night drinks. \u00a0The nachos were weird with cheese that was not your normal, but not as bad as I expected per Yelp reviews; I do agree with the chicken comments though. \u00a0The flatbread w/pesto and shrimp was yum, as well as many of the deserts (think Pizookie for those of you who go to BJ's restaurants). \u00a0The wings were OK and the fries were well liked. \u00a0  Bottom Line(s) - They don't serve food after 11pm. \u00a0The service is OK to decent. \u00a0And it is a bar at the hotel with plenty of TV's, so its more of a tourist spot than a local one. \u00a0Convenience is sometimes key... and that did it for us. \u00a0Would I return? If I stayed at the hotel. \u00a0Would I go out of my way otherwise? \u00a0Not likely.",

Being an -out-of-towner we checked Yelp for your advices....in fact, unfortunately, our hotel concierge was not sure 'where' or 'what' location would offer mutli-screen viewing capabilities near our hotel. We decided to take all-of-your-review advices and give it a try. We were NOT disappointed.....all we wanted was video, hopefully good food and drink. We lucked out.  Upon arriving, the host directed us to a center-area table but we saw that there were several 'private' booths with individual wall mounted monitors. The booths can comfortably seat up to 6 adults....but as there was just the 2 of us, the host obliged and we got exactly what we were hoping for. The host then gave us a channel selector and we honed in on the Giants game. Further, the advantage of the booth meant that we would have less distraction from other patrons.   Our waiters were quite prompt. We placed our bar-order (Coronas) and were provided same within minutes. Our food order included chicken wings, burgers and crab cakes. All was served well, enjoyable and priced moderately. Our total tab did not exceed 100.00 including tip prior to the end of the evening.  If you are looking for a rawcus (spelling) setting, this is NOT it. If you are looking for a pleasant and inviting location for sports viewing, a full bar, comfortable seating, friendly and attentive staff - and the ability to chat with your fellow guests while viewing and eating - Knuckles meets and exceeds that scenario. It's location, near Fisherman's Wharf, allows you to take any public transportation as we did.   Thumbs Up: 4+ on all points. Good show, Knuckles.",

How can you eat this stuff?\" more muffled mumbles. Hmmm. He wasn't saying that the day before when we dragged our tired travel feet up to the bar and he proceeded to order a vodka rocks. Which, is my point. It's really a sports bar that's attached to a hotel. You don't go to a pancake house for a scotch and soda, so why would you go to a sports bar expecting a great breakfast? Or, a great anything if it doesn't pair with a frosty beer? And, I might add, I counted 23 godzilla screen TV's.   Frankly, I thought the breakfast was decent. The scrambled eggs were cooked right, the bacon was well balanced with marbling; even the dollar sized pancakes hit the right spot...for what it was. C'mon. It's a sports bar that cooks a decent meal, served by staff who smile even though they're likely to never see your face again.   And, after checking out of the Hyatt, I zipped-in for an iced tea (not the Long Island kind), and the lunch fare seemed equally paired in quality with the breakfast. Fresh looking burgers and fries. Nice looking bowls of chowder. Why would you care anyway if your eyes are glued to one of the 23+ TV's? For all you know, you could be eating the brochure. \u00a0Frankly, I think my colleague did.   And then he went there. He ordered a vodka rocks and proceeded to try and pick up on a single traveling woman musician in the corner. Come to think of it, he did eat my brochure. I can't find it.",

Some food served was uncooked and food wasn't spectacular. \u00a0Sometimes if food isn't all that, service can make up for it but we didn't get either.",

The dining room is spacious, and the wall of TV's behind the bar makes for a first class sports bar. The food  was good though we only had sliders, nachos, and stuffed mushrooms. The happy hour appetizers are an especially good value. All in all a very enjoyable and relaxing experience if you're looking to stay close to the hotel.",

Bad food, poor service-inexperienced management, supposed sports bar TV's not properly placed to conveniently watch games unless your right at the bar (trying to make you buy drinks over food).  Came here to watch my GIANTS games...I thought this place was bad before the remodel and came back hoping they would improve the overall experience. NOT  I wish I could give them no stars!",

I havent been there before so I didnt care what it used to be, or is supposed to be, or whatever. Its a bar and restaurant with great daytime lighting and high ceilings, a nice bartender, and good food. On a Saturday afternoon it was not busy at all so we got fast service. We ordered two drinks and three appetizers for the two of us. The crab cakes, stuffed mushrooms, and calamari were all delivered within 10 minutes, and there are like 23 tvs in this place, and the booths have their own tvs! just like fuckin vegas.. mm .. vegas. I will visit again. Thank you cute bartender!",

The breakfast buffet was good. \u00a0The bacon wasn't over cooked and it wasn't undercooked, it was juuusssstttt right. \u00a0The other items like eggs, blueberry pancakes, local fruits and cheeses made it really good. \u00a0I'm not sure if it was worth $23, but it's nice breakfast in a nice hotel in an uber touristy area so those are the expectations. The dinner of fish &amp; chips was less expensive, \u00a0but not as enjoyable. \u00a0My fish was british style (not Vander Kemps wedges), but it was over cooked and burnt - the chips were meh. The service was great though. \u00a0The place has a good beer selection and I got to taste a couple beers before choosing and everyone was super nice. \u00a0I would eat here again, but not get the fish and chips. Also, if you are ever at the wharf and needing to get way from the crowds and over crazy priced food and out of the sun, it's a good place to go.",

All in all.. a work in progress. \u00a0But the place LOOKS amazing. \u00a0And the staff is genuinely well trained and gracious.  Oh how I love to find places in the city where they actually train staff, or where staff are innately gracious.  I'll try again and update... \u00a0This place bears no relation to its former self, really... \u00a0Which is good. \u00a0Except for the potatoes - Jaysus, man... \u00a0How hard is it to roast potato wedges???",
