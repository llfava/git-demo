He was more concerned with his online shopping he was doing on his computer than with his customers. Hopefully he bought the necklace he was searching for so that some good came of the day.   On the other hand, the wine was great, I had the custom flight and really enjoyed it and the ambience was nice. Service really makes a difference though, a lot of places have great wine.",

We started putting out jackets back on and I whipped out my slice of pizza to steal a couple bites before we carried on with our journey. The bar tender comes up to me again and asks if we had already been drinkin there, I told him no. Then he said \"well can't you see this is not a restaurant, you cant eat your food here.\" I said \"not a problem we are on out way out the door anyway.\" Then with a cynical tone he gestured toward the down and \"well then goodbye\". I was shocked, I said to him \" there is no reason to be rude about it.\" He replied \" I'm trying not to be, now leave.\"  There is just simply no reason to be rude to someone who has in no way wronged you.

The music is great which just adds to the enjoyment of the bar and the location is in walking distance of pizza (which goes great with a night of wine), late night Thai (probably the best thing in the world), and even donuts if you are feeling frisky.   Each time I have been here, counting three times now, the staff has been very friendly and approachable.

We had great service consistently through the evening from Ryan (too bad he only works Tuesdays!) and he tailored suggestions to our specific needs. As a wine enthusiast, I am very particular about regions, and varietals, and he was spot on. Also, the wine flights are very affordable and the pours were substantial! And the cheese boards? Delicious and generous on the nuts and cheese cuts. Will definitely come back soon!  Also, for the sports aficionados - they have several great plasmas that were showing the games of the evening - Giants and Sharks I believe. Furthermore - you can bring in food from the neighboring pizzerias if you want a heartier meal. Good music choices too - love Band of Horses and Miike Snow!  Bottom line: caters to all crowds, laidback environment, good service, generous pours, TVs, well-priced, and good but rotating selection of wines!",

Quiet, not near any rowdiness found on Polk St. Great snacks here as well.  They have wine and beer, and the basics for those who aren't too fond of too much. It works out. Enjoy an hour or two here, and there's plenty of food around to help.  Have yet to go in when there's live music, have been meaning to! Sell retail as well.   A nice spot for a few drinks, if you want to get away from crowds of people.

I work in the area and have passed this place more than a dozen times. 2 stars because the location is cool, the name is clever and I don't have it in my heart to give 1 star. My experience at POUR HOUSE was like buying infomercial anything; not as good as advertised.   Now I understand you're on Polk street and this is an easy sell to weekday warriors who are ignorant to good wines but really? The name is \"POUR HOUSE\" with a wine glass on the signage. So, show me the money [wines]! Half of the wines on the wine list were unavailable and 3 of the 4 wines we requested, the bartender asked us, \"What kind of wine is that?\"   After our bartender broke the cork of our 2004 Rutherford merlot, my colleagues meticulously removed the remaining slivers as best as they could but a few shards still dropped in. No cheese cloth to filter the cork. And no decanter. (No decanters at a wine bar?!? #dafuq???) Yea, I might sound wine snobbish but it's a friggin wine bar!  We dumped the first pour really hard to get the cork remnants out and enjoyed the 2004 vintage, which was surprisingly wonderful for 2004 not being a \"good year\" in Napa. We asked our bartender for a pint glass to filter out the cork in that first glass that we set aside. The bar tender looked at us with confusion and wonder at the request for a \"pint glass\" to which we responded, \"That glass that you pour a beer in.\" *lightbulb*   All in all it was a sad face experience. The look and feel of the place is awesome and if you don't give a crap about El Vino, and the depths of it's majesty, and just want some cool atmosphere that serves the juice, this is a good spot to hang.   I've left the bartender's name and description anonymous because he/she was very nice and did his/her best, but I am embarrassed for the owner that that person is a representative of a wine bar. My suggestion to said owner is to have weekly wine tastings for employees so that they can become educated on what they are pouring at POUR HOUSE, to have an current list of what is available, and to have a GREAT semi-secret stash for people who come in actually knowing about wine. There are a lot of service industry folk who roam around polk street who would enthusiastically back a place like this, if it were worthy. If this place actually held expertise in the niche it fronts to claim, POUR HOUSE could be one of those places that young, trendy winos with networks of great people would have a culty kind of love for. It could be a place where both a 2 buck chuck wine lover and a 5 year veteran server from a top steakhouse can both call home, and be excited to bring their friends. It's kinda whomp whomp to see an establishment claim their lane but not rock it out. Many reviews say it isn't busy here most of the time. If that's the way the owners like it, then great. For now, I'm rudely disappointed. But I look forward to coming back and hopefully updating my review with something better to say.",

We stayed close by and dropped in as we felt like some more wine after the initial days spent visiting wineries in Napa Valley. The place looks OK, sort of a cheap feel to the interior but there is nothing wrong with it.  To be a wine bar the selection of wine was surprisingly small but they seem to be more of a cheaper wine bar. Tried a chardonnay and a pinot noir, both were good but nothing worth remembering.   The bartender was pleasant enough but did not seem that interested in wines (have never seen someone struggling so much when opening a bottle of sparkling for another group so almost seemed he was new at the job)   It was easy to get a seat here and the ambiance was relaxed so it was great as a place to be able to sit down and talk at.",

As I took my stool, I looked around to see The Matrix was playing on one of the flat screens with a pretty good variety of music playing in the background. The Pour house is a cozy, warm, welcoming spot.

He was very knowledgeable and suggested things off the menu. \u00a0I'm not the biggest wine drinker but a \u00a0flight of red or white wine for $12 bucks sold me on my first visit. When we left the place was packed, I mean who can pass up drink specials on a weekend? \u00a0  My second visit I sat we sat on one of the big couches in one of two \u00a0lounge areas (The other has re-purposed wine barrel tables and chairs/ booths. I opted for a \"beer flight\" complete with 21st Amendment brews \"Back in Black\" from the tap and an Anchor Steam Humming Ale. The next time I go, I'm gonna order from the Thai place next door in addition to taking advantage of the happy hour choices.  If you are looking for mixed drinks, The Pour House is not for you. Wine, beer and small appetizer plates (Thai Food, if you want to BYOF) awaits those looking for a local wine and beer lounge.",

I've never had this happen before and I'm still in shock! \u00a0I just got off the phone with Liam Bigelow, one of the owners of what is now Pour House; formerly S.N.O.B. Wine Bar located at 1327 Polk St (between Bush St &amp; Austin St). \u00a0He told me that he would not honor a gift certificate from S.N.O.B at his new bar! \u00a0He said 'S.N.O.B. shut down in June or July [of this year]...' and even though he is partial owner of the new bar he will not honor the gift certificate. \u00a0This gift certificate I won at a fundraiser at my cousin's art show in the city back in 2007. \u00a0Granted, the gift certificate is from 3 years ago but is this even relevant; there is not an expiration date? \u00a0He was very rude to me on the phone and laughed out loud many times when we talked about the gift certificate being from 2007. \u00a0  Liam kept reminding me that S.N.O.B. is no longer in business. \u00a0I explained to him, I travel for work and I don't live in the City right now; 'How am I to know the business had closed? \u00a0I wasn't notified and neither did my cousin..'. \u00a0And then he gave an analogy that is quite telling; he actually said \"this would be like if you walked into a Mac Donald's that was once a Kentucky Fried Chicken and try to order KFC...\" he asked me, \"what do you think they would say?\". \u00a0I was blown away. \u00a0I responded \"I'm not talking with a franchise owner of Mac Donald's; I'm talking with the owner of a wine bar in San Francisco.\" \u00a0  Since the conversation was going very poorly I asked if he could simply asses the monetary value of the gift certificate and reimburse me; and he said 'no'. \u00a0The gift certificate is for an '8 person private wine tasting'. \u00a0I told him I want to come in with only two of my girlfriends and use the gift certificate. \u00a0To this; he said, all he could do is offer me three glasses of wine. \u00a0Clearly, I am not interested in sitting in this mans wine bar after he has cheated me and my cousin out of money and been excessively rude. \u00a0 Before we finished the call Liam took my phone number and said he would call me back after he talked this over with his new business partner; it's been over a week and he hasn't called.  Like I said I'm still in shock. \u00a0I've lived in California all my life and I love it here. \u00a0I've never had an experience that even comes close to this with a business owner, especially a small business owner. \u00a0He seems like a bad person who I would not support.",

Out of all the bottles I surprised that he recommended one of the cheaper Bottles on the menu. We ordered the Pinotage Ernst Gouws &amp; Co 2010 from South Africa. It's a red and has a really bold kinda fruity and smokey flavor to it! The bottle ran us 26.00 and they charged us 1.00 for a bowl mixed nuts. At the end of the night they told us that they sell all of their bottles of wine for 40% off of the listed price on the menu!  Only downside is that as soon as we walked in (9:00) the jazz band was packing up to leave. I love live music and would make this part of my rotation if they had music late on weekends! But over all we had a great time and for 5 people and our bill only being 35.00, I am sold.",

Back to our event - Chase and Nelson were the bartenders and they were awesome. We had between 50 and 60 people show up between 630 and 9 and I never heard anyone complain that they had to wait for their drinks. \u00a0Everyone had a great time. \u00a0When we walked in at first they were playing pretty loud rock, maybe even heavy metal. \u00a0I was surprised that heavy metal type rock would be playing at a wine bar ever... kind of a turn off. Chase was accomodating and took our requests for the music we liked for the night, which is awesome, but I can say that if I was just coming in for a drink that kind of music wouldn't make me want to stay. \u00a0  They didn't charge us to host our party in their bar which was awesome but we were a little disappointed that there were no deals whatsoever or something complimentary, like maybe something as simple as a bottle of champagne for us. \u00a0It would have been a nice gesture as we did give them a LOT of business on a Thursday night. \u00a0Also there was a calendar online that said wine was $1 off between 6-8 on Thursdays (event was April 5) and I'm pretty sure that discount wasn't passed on to our guests. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfpourhouse.com%2Fcalendar&amp;s=15032e092702f5edcf8fef24343ab7c0de9d9ad5f525647ba9198eeac1f90c8c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sfpourhouse.com/calendar</a>  The guy in charge of events wasn't very responsive so it was hard to plan our event. \u00a0At one point I asked for a list of food options and he never responded. \u00a0We decided to make our own arrangements and bring food in. \u00a0I got an email from him 4 days later asking about a head count. \u00a0When I told him we'd be bringing food of our own in he then told me we would have to purchase 4-5 platters in addition to the food we brought in. \u00a0We most likely would have bought platters from them but the lack of response made me feel like he didn't care so I didn't want to spend more money on food through them. \u00a0I almost felt like I was trying so hard to make the event work out, instead of the other way around. \u00a0 I believe in constructive criticism so hopefully they'll heed these comments and change the way they handle communication for future events.",

    "review_text": "The Pour House on Polk Street is a great place for a glass of wine or microbrew after work. It conveniently opens at 4pm, the time I think happy hour should start. The Pour House used to be SNOB (Sonoma, Napa or Beyond) but the subsequently changed the name and the vibe. SNOB was a bit pretentious and the service was about as rude as a NYC cab driver at 2am. I went twice before the name change and both times I felt as if I was inconveniencing the bartender by gracing her with my presence. But this has all changed, thankfully.   The Pour House has turned into a fabulous low-key semi-hipster place. The new atmosphere is relaxed, there is plenty of seating with a long wood bar (with purse hooks), 3 overstuffed couches up front and a splattering of tables in the dark, romantic back of the bar. Unless you know the majority of the people sitting on the couches, it can be a bit awkward to sit there. My friend and I started out on the couches but later moved after a group of 5 sat down. I really felt I was invading someone's living room couch. So if you have space issues or don't like people listening to your conversation then pick a seat at the bar or one of the tables in the back.  The bar offers 40 different premium wines and 25 microbrews (10 on tap). The bartender on duty was a very nice young man who unfortunately went to UCONN (I didn't hold it against him, we still tipped). My only complaint is that the cheese plate is horrible. First off you have two cheese choices, Jarlsberg and an unidentified crumbled goat cheese. The two cheeses come with massive wheat crackers that do nothing to compliment the cheese. The best part was the dish of salty olives. If I wasn't so starved, I would have told him he could keep it after my first glance. Another food option is to order from one of the restaurants on Polk Street and have them deliver right to you at the bar.",

Ideally, the Pour House should be the meeting of two fabulous worlds, but it was just OK.  Some friends picked me up along the way so I didn't have to worry about relying on mass transit in the city. That immediately put me in a good mood. Plus it was Friday night - TGIF!  As we walked in, there was late '90's pop music blaring. At a wine bar? Really? We giggled and grabbed a booth. The boys ordered beers and my gal pal and I each had a glass of vino. The beers were awesome! The wine? Meh, not so much. It was a generous pour, though, especially for a $6 glass. So cheers to quantity over quality. My friends also ordered a cheese plate, which came out with mixed nuts, olives and two different kinds of cheese. They ate most of it, so I can't speak for that part of our experience.   Since the music overhead kept getting louder and worse, we decided to leave. It wasn't offensive or anything, just not the kind of vibe we were going for. With many other awesome wine bars in SF and beyond, I just wasn't that impressed. But if I was in the 'hood and wanted a cheap glass of wine, this would be a good place to start.",

Be careful not to offend regulars and others nearby. They WILL ask you and your party to leave. So keep that in mind.  The bar area is pleasant with more tables around the back and towards the front. They do have high tables towards the left wall as you enter. The back area is for larger groups or quiet meetings. I got two flights of several wines. Both were filled rather generously. So I was happy about that. Other wine bars tend to skimp on quantity and believe me; when it comes to my wine, I'd rather have a couple of more sips!   Since it was dim, didn't take more pics.

    "review_text": "Usually this is a great, low-key, and easy going wine bar. One star for the ambiance, and one star for the quality of the wine. However, this time we went there on a Thursday evening, and it seemed great to begin, as there were only 5 other people there, so we felt like we practically had the entire place to ourselves. There was a female bartender, whom was heavily flirting with two guys at the bar, just 4 bar stools away from us. Usually I am cool with such things, so we waited patiently for them, hoping she might find a way to politely excuse herself to take our order. I waited until she served them, and after waiting another 5 minutes, I politely raised my hand, and gestured with a friendly smile that we were ready, she looked me in the eye, and turned away to continue her conversation, as if we were lepers. After several more minutes, I tried to politely catch her attention in the same manner, again, not even an acknowledgement of our existence, \u00a0although she looked me directly in the eye. By now about 15 minutes have gone by, and a couple walks in, and sits at a table against the wall across from the bar, and they sit patiently waiting as well, and the bartender continues her flirtatious conversation. The couple gets up, and walks up, and has to interrupt the conversation to get the bartender's attentions, and in retrospect I probably should have done the same, but I try to take the polite, and gentle approach, especially when the bar is so slow. The bartender reacts to the couple with a whole lot of attitude, and a very rude look, but at least they seem to have managed to get the bartender to start doing her job, and they receive their wine. Silly us, we thought that she might realize at that point that there were other people, like us, still sitting there at the bar, very close to her, whom were still waiting to order, and we even tried to flag her down, as she served the couple, but no, she jumped right back to flirting with the guys. After 20 minutes, I was waiving my hands in the air, and leaning over, so I was behind the guys, and there would be no way that she could continue to ignore us, and pay attention to the guys, without being distracted by me. After she let out a hipster huff of frustration, she finally came over to us, and instead of making any effort to reconcile the obvious error on her part, the first thing she said to us, is in a snotty tone is, \"there are a lot of other people I have to serve here, who ordered before you, want do you want?\" Wow! So, even though the other 5 people already had their drinks, and were not asking her for anything, and the couple that came later and asked her for two glasses of wine, were a lot of people to be occupied by? I can understand when a bar is busy, as I grew up working in family hotels, and restaurants, so I have a great deal of empathy for anyone in this industry, but the fact that she blatantly ignored us, and gave us, and others, so much negative attitude, and clearly ignored her job in favor of trying to hook up with someone, is simply inexcusable. It was slow enough, that she could have very quickly taken our orders, and gone back to hitting on the guys, and we would have been cool with it. We would have been able to relax with our wine and dive into our own conversation. Instead, we received horrible service, a BS excuse with a lot of entitled negative attitude, and very small pours in retaliation for politely asking to order, and I know this, because we have been served wine there many times before.",

There's a good selection of wine and beer, plus good quality munchies and snack foods.  While we were there early, it filled up pretty quick.

Because I don't know my way around good wines quite yet, I was actually looking at the menu in confusion. The bartender probably saw the dopey look on my face, so he recommended the Red Wine Flight. 4 generous pours of their best red wines. Needless to say, they were all very good.  They've also got beer here, which is an instant plus for me. Unfortunately, they were sold out of the Dogfish Head when we visited. My friend and I were extremely sad. But the Duvel was a decent substitute.  One other thing, if you ever get hungry, you can actually order food from the Thai restaurant up the street (Chai-Yo, I think it was called). And they actually BRING IT TO YOU while you're at the bar! Again, win-win for both businesses.   The bartender for the night (Nelson) was a very awesome dude. Giving good recommendations and always willing to help out his customers. A winning attitude for any business, in my opinion.  Overall, I WILL come back again (once I find some friends who know how to appreciate wine). Great service, good drinks, even better buzz. They even allow DOGS in there! Always awesome.",

The bartenders I have had here have been pretty good. The wine flights are great and not too pricey, and its a cool intimate setting. They sometimes have someone playing the piano or some music in the back, which is a nice addition.   If planning a night here, you may want to call ahead and check as they sometimes have events... I have happened upon two speed dating events. This kind of takes up the space, so in the future I will call ahead to make sure its not one of those nights.",

It felt weird to ask him questions and he be so un-imformed.... dude, you are working at a WINE BAR -know SOMETHING about wine....\"the grape starts with a T I know that...\" wow.

It's so refreshing to find a place on Polk where you can listen to great music while still hearing yourself talk, all while enjoying great wines for a reasonable price.   They are very generous with their pours and let you try anything before ordering a glass. The owner, Liam, was funny, engaging and so appreciative of his clients and the bartenders were attentive and very friendly. There was no pretentiousness like you find at so many other wine bars and we felt like we were really taken care of there.  They do close around midnight, so it's not a great late night place, but it's the perfect spot for a mellow evening with friends or a date. This is definitely a gem in Russian Hill and I will be coming back often.",

I had a Cabernet Sauvignon first time and a red wine flight on the second visit. Service is generally friendly, sometimes a bit slow but always friendly.  They have a small area in the back where performers play on occasion.  High point: good prices and good wine and cheese Low point: sometimes slow service. Chances we will go back ? Yes and already have. I can see this becoming a regular place for us.",

My friends and I frequented this place on Memorial Day, in of which, it was one of the few wine bars on Polk street that were open and until midnight.   The girl working provided excellent service. She was attentive and quick and allowed my friends and I a couple tastes before buying a bottle to share. The wine selection could have been more extensive; however, we were satisfied with what we had. We also had an additional glass of their sparkling wine and Rose, which were both crisp and refreshing. Additionally, the atmosphere was great but maybe because it was a Monday night. They did have live music for a little while, which added to the relaxed atmosphere.   Overall, my friends and I had an enjoyable experience and appreciated the good service. I would definitely come back here again!",

It wasn't very packed and we sat at the bar. 20 minutes or so later this wave of people came in. Mixed bag of folks. I didn't care for the bartender's attitude. He wasn't the friendliest.

And everyone is treated with the same exact attention.  I came here for a birthday the first time I came and we sat in the big table in the back. Won't lie- a few of us were intrigued by the big ladder by the bar and tried our best not to climb up!   Service is always great, with very generous pours. The interiors have a very warm, comforting feel, without the fancy window dressings.   If you don't think you can afford Amelie, a few blocks up post, this place is a great substitute and I can pronounce half the list (never was too good at french).   Try it out! It's never been too crowded. Loves it",
