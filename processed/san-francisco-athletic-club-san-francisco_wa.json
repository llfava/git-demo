On the other hand, if you don't get the Tennis channel, this is a good place to watch Tennis games you might not otherwise see.  As for the food, SFAC hit one of my pet peeves - being told that food is not spicy hot when in fact it is. \u00a0Don't believe the server if they say the chili isn't hot. \u00a0It is very spicy. \u00a0On the other hand, this problem was quickly and politely solved with a substitute order. \u00a0The house salad is very good, as was my friend's hot dog.  Prices: \u00a0A little high, esp. when you consider they have a surcharge of 4% for health coverage for their staff. \u00a0 Would we go back? \u00a0Only if they were showing a game that we couldn't get at home or somewhere else.",

I really hope that this is not the future of our great neighborhood. The owners clearly wanted to cater to one demographic.

The place was a lot of fun! Lots of TVs all around (great for sports - we watched part of the Warrior's winning game). The bar had a lot of seats around it which was where our group was primarily focused, but there is a lot of room away from the bar as well, including a spot in the back where they'll even lower bleacher-style seating for parties.   I was starving when we arrived so I ordered a menu before getting a drink. The girl next to me was eating nachos and I ordered the same thing ($11, you can add chicken for $4 but it's a lot of food without that). My husband and I really enjoyed the crispy bean and cheese covered chips. I loved all the jalapenos throughout the cheesy goodness, but a spicy slice occasionally hid in the guacamole or under sour cream, so my husband had to inspect his chips more closely. Lots of olives too - and I was treated to a homemade hot sauce/salsa on the side. Super hot! Super delicious.  I had a Bloody Mary and I was pleased that my \"sort of spicy\" request was spot on. Erin made the perfect sort-of-spicy drink and even resalted my rim without me asking after seeing most of the salt had kind of rinsed off onto the side of the glass. Seriously wonderful bartender. And she kept coming over to check on us, making sure we had enough glasses of water - and of course, quite a few Fireball shots. Hours later we left the bar with a $70 tab that I thought was really fair.  One thing that I've probably never mentioned in a yelp review but is worth mentioning here: the napkins! The soft, absorbent napkins were the best! No, I'm not kidding, they really stood out in my memory. They were perfect for keeping ourselves clean while eating our finger food.",

In my party of 3, everyone could see the action from the 20 or so big screens. We had a few beers and the donkey spit mezcal cocktail...I recommend this one if you enjoy smokey flavor of mezcal.

The selection of beer looks good from a glance as well. On those merits alone, I'm glad this place is here.  I'm still holding out more hope for the food. It's price point is as high as you would expect for a San Francisco eatery but the quality is a little hit or miss. I recommend the chicken club as that seems to be the most consistently good thing on the menu. I would avoid the nacho appetizers, as they tend to come out a little undercooked, with un-melted shredded cheese. The wings are solid but won't blow you away.",

    "review_text": "We have visited SFAC on 3 different occasions. The first time was a very quiet Saturday afternoon before football season started-- that day, the service was attentive and the food was tasty (however, somewhat overpriced).   The second time was for college football a few weeks ago and the place was definitely busier, but not too crowded. That time, the service was abysmal and the food quality lower than the first time. We had to ask 3 different people to get a TV channel changed to the game we wanted to watch. The first person replied, \"I think we can do that,\" but didn't. The second person said \"I think they will.\" But they didn't. Finally we were able to find the owner, who changed it for us easily. They really need to talk to their staff about this-- watching a specific game is the reason you come to a bar like this and there was no reason why it couldn't have been done the first time we asked (she could have just asked the owner to do it if she didn't know how).  Nonetheless, we decided to give the place another shot and reserved a booth for this past Sunday to watch the 49er game and Giants game, which happened to be on at the same time. When we showed up for our reservation, we were told that some people were finishing the Redskins game on the main TVs but after that we could switch the channel. We were fine with that until we realized that also meant that we weren't allowed to sit in our reserved booth until that game was over, either. We waited 25 minutes over our reservation time for the game to finish, missing the first quarter of the 9er game crammed into a corner and unable to order anything. It was soo PACKED!  When the Redskins game finally finished, I had to ask the owner if he planned on telling those in the booth that they had to move. He was going to make us do it! I'm sorry, but making us wait like that was bad enough without making us act as bouncer for their customers, too. The owner helped us ask people to move but only after I asked him. Once we sat down, our server did her best to serve us but our food took over an hour to come. Just crazy. [Props to the server for trying super hard in what must have been horrible working conditions. I'm pretty sure the place must have been packed over their fire code capacity and they weren't being very attentive about it!]  Also I should note that the vibe here on game days is super Marina douchey. I saw some guys almost get into a fist fight over seating... A drunk guy jumped onto the pool table and stood up there... A rude girl stuck her hand in my friend's plate of food and took his fries when he teased her about using our table as her personal bartop... A wasted guy was passed out outside after the game and his friends had apparently just left him there bleeding. Yeah, that was the vibe.   Finally, I really have to note the absurdity of their prices given the atmosphere and (declining) food quality and service. Their house burger is $15, and a pitcher of basic beer (Stella, for example) was $22 for what seemed to be only a few pints. Very not worth it. Will not be returning.",

You can't really look anywhere in this bar without having a TV somewhere in your peripherals. Which means, there's really no bad seat in the house. Love the bleacher seats they got in the back of the bar. Just a little dirt and grass away from the real deal baseball field.  Prices are a little bit steep here though. Don't really mind paying it all that much, but still, a hit to the pocket isn't much appreciated. Atmosphere here isn't all that bad. Really haven't encountered any of the \"douchey\" type that everyone else is complaining about, and the service here was super friendly, and they made sure to check up on us every so often, even on a busy Giants playoff game night.

Yes, they have a lot of TVs so you have a great angle from everywhere you sit or stand. They also have shuffle board. Those are the only positive things I can say about this place.   \u00a0 \u00a0 I once called AND went in person to see what time they opened because I'm interested in watching Premier League soccer. Both employees assured me \"they were open any time there's a game.\" Highly doubtful. There is ALWAYS a game happening somewhere in the world. Sure enough when I went bright and early, they were closed.   \u00a0 \u00a0 I went with some friends once to get some food. Ordered a cheeseburger. Simple enough. It was awful. Cooked all the way through the frozen patty. Tasted just like the burgers at a stadium - not something to be proud of. And it had the price to match, $12.   \u00a0 \u00a0 Went another time just to grab a beer. Sat at the bar for about 15 minutes and nobody even came remotely close to my end of the bar so I stood up and left.   \u00a0 \u00a0 Last thing to add - unfortunately the Marina douchebag crowd comes over the hill to this place for their frat-tastic fist-pumping reunions. Overall this place was a huge disappointment.",

The server was polite, pleasant, and efficient. Not much else to say about the service... It was quick and to the point. My main gripe was the price. 13 for the sandwich, 3 for a soda.

Came here with two friends on a Saturday evening towards the end of a World Cup match. \u00a0I ordered a beer and Chicago hot dog and my other friends ordered the same dog, the Sriracha chicken wings, a two cocktails, and a vegetarian burger.  First to come out were the hot dogs. \u00a0Burnt to a crisp on the outer layer, yet stone cold inside. \u00a0My friend's dog had the same problem but also had a burnt bun. \u00a0Also, not even close to Chicago style-ish.  We were told the burnt dog was how the kitchen normally cooks hot dogs, and that the cold temperature was because they left an outside kitchen door open. \u00a0They offered to replace it with something else. \u00a0I got a SFAC burger instead and my friend went with a second try of the Chicago dog. \u00a0  The second time was alright. \u00a0There really wasn't anything special about the SFAC burger. \u00a0I had to ask for more of the Thousand Island sauce to get some flavor out of it. \u00a0Definitely not worth $12. My friend's dog was alright and so was my other friend's vegetarian burger.
