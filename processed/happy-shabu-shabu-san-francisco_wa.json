The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. \u00a0However, I couldn't believe how slow the service was! We got the AYCE shabu with beef and chicken. \u00a0The beef was nice and thinly cut, as we saw someone standing there cutting the beef with the nifty machine! However, the quality of the meat was okay. \u00a0It was not as marbled as other places. \u00a0The chicken just tasted normal, like pieces of boiled chicken. \u00a0It was cool that they give you three different sauces to dip everything in. \u00a0The vegetables were okay, but lacked some variety. \u00a0It is pretty cool how each person gets their own pot, although I feel like I have to yell across to talk to my friends. \u00a0Overall, everything was okay until I had to keep on flagging down the waiters. \u00a0Service is super bad here. \u00a0It's all you can eat, but if you can't find your waiters and get more food, what's the point of that?!?! :P",

I went with a friend before a movie on a Tuesday around 6pm and it was empty, easy to get a table. Service was super quick and attentive. It was our first time experiencing Shabu and our waitress was happy to explain how everything worked. Each person got their own pot to boil their meat, veggies, etc. I had chicken and my Friend had beef and we shared pot stickers. it was SO much to eat, we could never have done all you can eat!. The meat was fresh and healthy. They even have a freezer with the mean showcased as you walk in so that you know it is of quality. The meal is super healthy and filling. You order a meat dish, or combo of meats, then on the side you get noodles, veggies, cabbage, tofu, etc to add to the stew pot. You will not leave hungry of feeling greasy. Thus having some sake or beer with your meal doesn't make you feel guilty. I would think this would be a great place for groups. they have long banquet tables that can accommodate up to 20 people where each person can still have their own cooking pot.   If you are looking for a good, healthy, filling meal on a cold day, or a place to take a group, I would recommend happy Shabu Shabu. I can't wait to go back. However, next time I'll pass on the chicken, it just tasted like boring boiled chicken even with all the dipping sauces. The beef is definitely the way to go.",

However, being a beast who inhales food, I would say that 2 hours is more than enough time for me as I was stuffed to death by 1 hour and 15 min- granted I didn't really chew but inhaled all I could inhale :)  The food here is very good and they are pretty generous and attentive in refilling our plates as we get low. \u00a0What I don't like about the restaurant is the way the tables are set. \u00a0For big parties, if you have 8 people, you sit in a table section where you can each have your own pot. \u00a0However, the tables are really far away from each other leaving a huge gap in the middle for waiters to walk between to turn on and off the pot. \u00a0So you will have to shout far and loud to talk to your friends or limited to only talking to people who are directly next to you. \u00a0If you have over 8 ppl in your party, they'll seat you in the same place and some people will have to share pots.  Lastly, they have a spicy sauce you can add to your broth to give it a little kick, but they dont have that out so you'll have to ask for chili pepper sauce.",

Tonight's experience means I will never go back. \u00a0Upon sitting down, we were told again - no all-you-eat option, as someone is ordering the seafood. \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0 Let's start with a beer and a glass of white wine. \u00a0Nope, all out of white wine! \u00a0In addition, they were also out of the miso paste - and rice! \u00a0I mean really? \u00a0You are out of rice? \u00a0the staple of EVERY meal on the menu? \u00a0The meat quality was still ok, but if you have to buy it by the plate it is EXPENSIVE and the seafood was frozen solid.

I had a large group, and there was another large group too. \u00a0Right when we got in, we saw that one of our large groups had to sit outside. \u00a0It was windy and cold that day. \u00a0Thankfully, it was the other group that got the 'cold treatment' and we were say inside. \u00a0They looked pretty pissed though, can't imagine what their yelp review might look like.  Then came dinner. \u00a0Naturally, with big parties, some people come late, but for the most part, a lot of my group was there. \u00a0However, that didn't stop the manager from constantly pestering us. \u00a0The odd thing though was the he wasn't flat out saying things to us, it was very passive aggressive. \u00a0Like if he wanted us to wrap up, he would tell us that there's a group coming in an hour. \u00a0So it's like he was implying we should hurry, but not flat out telling us. \u00a0He was also kind of rude about it.  Be careful having large parties here too. \u00a0It's a pretty small place, so if you have a large group, you'll no doubt have some awkward seating arrangements. \u00a0Luckily, by the end of dinner, I was a little buzzed, so I didn't care about any of that.

You have to be seated in 1 row, or if you want to be across from each other, you'll be about 6 feet away from your friends because of a gap between tables. This is terrible for conversation.  Restaurant policy: ridiculous. We had 4 ppl total. 3 of us wanted all you can eat, and 1 person was a vegetarian. They refused to let her order vegetarian only dish and insisted she pay for the all you can eat meat price because all 4 of us had to do it. The restaurant was almost empty, so its not like you couldn't figure out if we were trying to cheat them of $10. So we asked them to split the bill (we were sitting 6 ft away from each other after all)... 2 would do ala carte so the other 2 can do all you can eat. They refused. So we all did ala carte. They lost an automatic $30 in revenue by not letting 3 of us upgrade. And it turns out that no one wanted more than 1 plate of meat anyways, because the quality was so terrible. What we should have done was walked out from the onset.   Will never go here again, and would never recommend this place. For the food, ambience and service, I'd recommend shabu house or anywhere besides here. Btw, most shabu shabu places offer all you can drink/eat options.",

I believe i saw the owner sitting outside before i walked in so i thought to myself... probably no business at this time. As i walked in i saw a television and lots of empty tables! Yeah for empty tables! Only took me 1 minute to figure out where to sit, since there's so much to choose from. Sat down ordered and chilled to the korean background music, while watching the NBA on tv.   As most all you can eat place can't really have a group with all you can eat, and non all you can eat, unless separated. Service was 100% since we were the only ones there. Each person has their own pot to cook their food in and 3 different type of sauce. Along with a dish of veggies and noodles. Only had to type of meat, Chicken and Beef, so i decided to try some chicken.   I was hoping for some rice, since the last shabu i had a few years back served rice, but apparently i didn't get any. The first 2 plates of beef was really good, since it was thinly sliced. After the 3rd plate, i felt that the meat started to taste a bit flavorless or maybe unfresh? All i can say is it didn't have the same feeling as the first 2 dish i ate earlier.   I ate about 4 plates of beef, and was looking at the owner and the waitress. Based on their expression of their face, it almost looked as if their saying....\"How can that little guy eat so much?\" Since i finished the first 2 plates in about 20 mins or so. I believed i was there eating for about almost 1 1/2 hours.  Overall i would say the service for today was 90% good~! since the waitress occasionally kept coming and asking if we needed anything; considering there was no one in there but us. I was sad cause i didn't get any rice! xD \u00a0Also my soup changed color after the 3rd plate, probably thats why my beef tasted crappy. Needed new Soup!...  It would be better if they had more variety of meat to choose from, like Sheep! that would make me coming back for more!, but nope. I thought it was funny how a random person came in asking if they can use the bathroom, but was refused since it was \"customers only\" and that guy just took a piss outside the trashcan or something.",

    "review_text": "I've been to this shabu shabu establishment countless times, since the opening of the restaurant. The food has consistently stayed fresh and my experience has been consistently pleasant here.   The food:  I normally order either the beef entree shabu shabu or the beef all you can eat shabu shabu. First of all, the ingredients are very fresh (from what my amateur palate can tell) including the vegetables (bok choy, spinach, napa cabbage, shitake mushrooms, carrots, tofu) and angus beef (well-marbled, not too lean (which becomes even leaner if u boil it!), but not too fatty either). I've been to Cafe Mum's before and I felt that happy happy's quality of beef was higher. In terms of the entree portions, I think it may be on the light side, especially for those coming in very hungry. Because of this fact, when i come here hungry, i prefer to opt for the all you can eat. I think the all you can eat option is a good value (~25) especially since the combined price of a beef entree + extra plate of beef comes out to the same price!   The service:  There isn't too much to say under this category since shabu shabu is more of a self-service affair. Sometimes i felt the service was understaffed, though i would wholely understand from their point of view why they wouldn't staff many more waitresses for a self-service cuisine. Despite being understaffed, however, when I did ask for something, the waitress/waiter got it to me promptly. I guess one gripe that i have with the staff is that they come over to your stove often to adjust the heat setting. Sounds great, but there were times where i wanted the water boiling more and would adjust it myself manually and the waitress would then come over and readjust it! Annoying haha.   The setting:  First of all, i greatly appreciate the fact that happy shabu shabu provides every customer with their OWN pot (as opposed to cafe mum's). It makes the dining experience much less stressful when you don't have to fight for the pot. Despite that first positive, however, i really wish this place arranged the counters in a better way. It is designed where every pair of counter space is divided in the center by a walkway so that the waitress can come over and adjust the heat of your pot. The problem is, though, that if you have a companion sitting across from you, they are pretty far from you, making it seem like you have to yell to talk to them. In other words, if you want to be able to feel like you're sitting close or next to your friends, you would have to have them sit adjacent to you on your left or right side. There can be no decent face to face arrangement in this restaurant.   Overall, i always have a satisfying dining experience here. The food is really good and i think the best shabu shabu ive had in the city so far. The service is lacking at times, but it's forgiveable (they are not rude or stuck-up or anything like that). I recommend this restaurant =).",

First of, it's a trap. It's Cantonese people operating an Japanese style restaurant without the grace and substance to back it up. But they did overcharge wholeheartedly.  It's like going to kindergarten here, an entry level service. It offered individual big pot \"in\" the counter top. Nothing communal here. One had to get a portable stove to use on the dining table.  The menu was so limited with chicken and beef as meat choice, some tofu, vegetables, and noodles. It's much cheaper to get the combo for $15, than ordering individual items. The quantity was anemic by $15.  There was a choice for all-you-can-eat: $22 (just beef and chicken) or $30 for meats and seafood. Too much for this simple restaurant.  There was no alternate choice for broth or sauce. The only pluses are clean and fresh foods. Service was so-so.  So diners, it's too simplistic for a hot pot experience.

We ordered all you can eat deal which includes beef and chicken. I only order beef that night. It was thinly sliced, right in front of me. They also give you a dish of noodles and veggies to throw into your miso broth. you also get 3 different types of dipping sauce to choose from. Everything was very tasty and fresh. Service was very good and attentive and made sure I was enjoying my meal and boy I was. I ended up eating 2 plates of veggies/noodles and 3 plates of beef. When you are just starving and want a meal to fill you up this is the place to come to. A little pricey but think about it you're paying for good quality food. I will definitely be coming back.",

The kobe beef is a must, along with the spicy ponzu! Plus you can't help but love the old Japanese man that always smiles and slices your meat for you!

I got an order of beef and the meat plate was huge comparatively. And the beef was REALLY nice compared to some places which have really thick meat or meat with a grainy texture. An order of beef also came with good amounts of cabbage, bok choy, mushrooms,tofu, and two types of noodles. There are also three types of dipping sauces but I usually don't use any \u00a0sauce.  If you are still hungry, you can easily upgrade to ALL YOU CAN EAT for $22.95, just $6 more, and ask for more of whatever you need. Some all you can eat places get stingy and give small refills but not here! We had to ask for smaller refillls since we were getting stuffed! Great service. The owner was our waiter and super polite and attentive.   I love the shabu shabu in Korea and have been looking for a place in SF that has Korean style shabu shabu. Most places have been more Japanese style which is okay but just not as satisfying. This place has good meat but the soup and sauces were just okay.  This place is still pretty good and we will keep coming back! (Out of the like 6 shabu places we've tried, the only other place we go back to is G Cube.)",

I was more shocked that this establishment came to be the type to talk crap about their customers rather than what they said about my looks alone.   \u00a0 My boyfriend and I did the all you can eat which consist of beef, chicken, and vegetables for roughly 23 dollars a person. The vegetables consist of napa, baby bok-choy, a carrot, a chive, some mein/vermicelli, three small cube tofu, and enoki mushrooms. \u00a0  The quality of our meat was poor, I was sick of it by the end of the night. The sauce they offered for dipping was delicious. It came in a peanut sauce, beef satay sauce, and vinegar-soy sauce. There is only one soup base which was a basic chicken broth.   An old employee was slicing our beef on the machine in front of us and was very helpful although he did not speak English.Our crap-talking waiter on the other hand offered crappy service and was hanging out in the kitchen most of the time and seemed annoyed whenever we asked him for more tea, more vegetables, or to simply raise or lower our heat. \u00a0When we spoke Cantonese to him, he had the huh expression on his face as he realized that he was BUSTED!    OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Super low-quality meat, bad service that talks crap, nice ambiance, soup base might as well have been the original shabu shabu, water. \u00a0  I have been to a number of shabu shabu's and this would be the worst one of all.",

As I am new to the whole world of shabu shabu, my SF network is convinced this was the best of the best when it came to all you can drink and eat that was closest to our neck of the woods. \u00a0We were here on two separate occasions, so this will be a merging of those reviews.  The large group dinner: We had a huge group of 20 or so. \u00a0Most of us did all you can drink and eat. \u00a0When its a large group, the table/burners are placed a bit far so it is hard to talk to the people across the way. \u00a0If doing the all you can drink, drinks are plentiful. \u00a0The owner comes around with this horrible, and possible illegal beverage he pours shots of. \u00a0Quite terrible, and definitely don't drink it. \u00a0It wasn't crowded for a Friday night, and it runs about $38 per person. \u00a0Not bad for a night of good food and drinking.   The small girls dinner: \u00a0About 6 of us. \u00a0So we were able to just be at two bar areas. \u00a0Again.. the gap in the center of the tables does make it a challenge to hear each other, and less intimate but we made it work. \u00a0No drinking this time around, but good food and company made it an enjoyable experience  The food: \u00a0The broth is a miso based broth, which was tasty. \u00a0They have three dipping sauces to suit your palate. \u00a0There is a variety of vegetables which is nice with two kinds of mushrooms. \u00a0The meat was sliced thin and tasty and the chicken was ok. \u00a0I preferred the beef over the chicken, but that is just my own personal choice. \u00a0They also offer up two kinda of noodles to throw in the pot, which my girlfriend was all about. \u00a0  The service: \u00a0The owner was entertaining and definitely wanted to make it a rowdy place. \u00a0But all in all, the servers were attentive and offering often if we wanted more protein and vegetables. \u00a0They also responded well to our specific demands on the type of veggies we wanted instead of bringing the variety plate.  All in all. \u00a0This is a good place for a crowd. \u00a0You know going into it how much each person will spend, and you can literally simmer here for a couple hours eating slowly since the food is cooking and drinking. \u00a0But watch out. Those sake bombs creep up on you :)",

Last time I did shabu-shabu was in New York some 30 years ago. Loved it then, or maybe just delighted by the novelty. The fish and seafood here was freezer-burned and stiff before dipping in bland miso broth. Sauces included a sesame dressing (not bad on the noodles, but nothing to write home about,) plain soy sauce, and a hotter soy heavy on the Tabasco, with sesame seed floaters. There were jars of diced scallion and celery, and minced garlic - which the broth badly needed. \u00a0Soba and bean thread noodles, one slice of carrot, one shiitake mushroom, one scallion spear, some bok choy and Chinese cabbage, and several cubes of tofu rounded out the dish. These items were to be placed in a dish smaller than the sauce bowls. Ginger would have lent a bit of flavor. As it was, the best- tasting part of the meal was the rice green tea.

My friends and I did the all you can eat/drink for $35/person. So worth it considering 2 of my friends passed out at the bar we went to after this place aka got our moneys worth!   Food: Okay pretty typical shabu shabu. The meats are thinly cut and seem pretty high quality. The beef and lamb were solid. Chicken is meh. I don't normally do chicken at shabu shabu places but someone in our group decided to get it. They also bring out 3 dipping sauces: ginger, spicy, and mustard. The mustard sauce was a little suspect, because I expected it to taste like the mustard dipping sauce from Benihana's. The broth was delicious after the lamb hit the hot water. The waitresses and owner are super accommodating and you will definitely get full from this place.   Experience: We had a group of 7 and they didn't have suitable seating for us to sit together inside so they set up the benches outside and cranked on the heat lamps. It was perfect for a summer night in SF (hence the heat lamps because it's never THAT NICE in SF). My friends and I were loud and obnoxious and outside seating was perfect. There's not a whole lot around there so we didn't bother anyone and no one bothered us. The owner drank shots with us and even poured us \"special\" drinks - the holy water and the hell? (eh forgot the name of the second shot, hence all you can drink) Holy water was essentially flavored soju and the hell shot was 129 proof (can't really remember...) of nasty rubbing alcohol.   To sum up the night, it was a shit show and we only paid $45 ($35 + generous tip) to be completely filled to the rim with delicious shabu shabu and more sake + beer than we could have ever needed or wanted. Good times, will definitely be back here with friends again.",

But on to the important part... The FOOD. My friends and I all got beef and chicken plates ($14.99/plate), and I ordered an extra plate of fishballs on the side ($8 for 6 balls). There was a decent amount of meat, although the veggies and noodles that came \u00a0as sides were smaller portioned than I expected (i.e. ONE shitake mushroom, two bites of noodles). The broth was ok-- basically diluted miso soup. The three dipping sauces were also lackluster, so I opted to eat everything \"natural\", aka without sauce.   Service was friendly, but not overly aggressive. When I sat down, the waitress immediately brought me a much needed cup of hot tea.   Overall, nothing particularly special about this place.

When it came time to leave, we respectfully requested that we be allowed to split the bill several ways. \u00a0To answer our request, the manager sent out a calculator, a pen and paper, and told us to divey it up, but only 6 ways max. \u00a0If you're already allowing us to split 6 ways, why not 12 ways? \u00a0Dumb.  The one bright spot of this night was Serena, our server. \u00a0She was awesome, hands down! \u00a0Many thanks to her for putting up with us.",

    "review_text": "More like 2.5 stars really. I don't have any big complaints about this place. The service, prices, and environment were decent. \u00a0The food was just ... eh. \u00a0It would have been 3-4 stars if the food had pushed my buttons a bit more.  The broth was very plain and it felt like I was basically cooking in plain boiling water. \u00a0Sure there are sauces there but I'm a fan of shabu places that I can get some extra kick or flavor by just cooking in the pot. \u00a0I had to dump about half of the garlic and green onion self serve containers PLUS about a half plate of beef \u00a0just to get a little flavor in there. \u00a0I also ended up dumping some ponzu and hot sauce directly into the soup for the same reason.  The meat was a bit fatty at times ( I had about 4 plates worth ) and the chicken was as bland as can be since they were basically 1/4 inch slices of unmarinated chicken breast.   The veggie, noodle, tofu and mushroom selection was fine. But again, I wish the broth just had more kick to it as eating loads and loads of ponzu sauce flavored food gets old. \u00a0And this is from a huge ponzu fan.  It is VERY nice to get your own pot though. And the place itself was very clean and well organized. \u00a0So that's a definite plus.  Overall, decent but has plenty of room to improve for sure. \u00a0Maybe I'll come back if I hear of some changes later on.",

    "review_text": "Have you ever cheated on your lover?  I haven't.  But now I have a good idea of what it might feel like.  Last night, after placing a call to Shabu House at 9:30, the waitress informed me that their kitchen closes at 9:30, it's too late to come. \u00a0Alright - but what to do now? \u00a0I had a massive craving for Shabu House.  Then the idea occurred to me. \u00a0Desperate times call for desperate measures \u00a0-- I'd have to try another.  Enter: \u00a0Happy Shabu Shabu. Now, I have heard of this place, and I had read some of the reviews some time ago - and while my brain found it impossible to process the possibility that anything on the planet might be better than Shabu House, a closed kitchen doesn't help me at all, so off to Happy Shabu we headed.  Now, there is no doubt that Rob and I can eat. \u00a0We were hungry, and ready to battle the beef, so to speak. \u00a0I felt guilty, though I really shouldn't - but that wasn't going to stop me from eating.  Here is what we noted:  1. \u00a0Seating is really strange. \u00a0I read that it was strange, and indeed, it was strange. 2. \u00a0Service is very friendly - - young servers, and all helpful, but service, compared to Shabu House, was slower. \u00a0 It took a significant amount of time to even begin the meal. \u00a0That said, each additional plate of meat came at the speed of light. 3. \u00a0Soup: \u00a0they, like my SH, have a \"miso-soup\" but there was NO comparison. \u00a0NONE. \u00a0We spent the majority of our time \"fixing\" the soup with what condiments they had - - but never really succeeded. 4. \u00a0Sauces: \u00a0Ponzu sauce was OK, sesame sauce was lesser, but they served a spicy sauce - which was quite good. \u00a0However, they do not have the radishes.... ponzu w/ no radish??? 5. \u00a0All-you-can-eat option is FIRST - CHEAPER... by some 7 dollars per person, and second - consists of beef and chicken, instead of beef and lamb. \u00a0The chicken was a nice addition but by half a plate, I didn't want anymore - and stuck to beef only. 6. \u00a0Speaking of beef - - \u00a0it's not American Kobe like Shabu House - and you can tell. \u00a0It really wasn't bad, and much better than Shabu-Sen's regular beef, but it wasn't comparable to that of Shabu House. \u00a0 7. \u00a0Veggies: \u00a0no spinach, tons of Napa Cabbage, two kinds of noodles (glass and fresh) and mushrooms, etc. \u00a0I love spinach, ding. \u00a0The noodles were a good addition compared to Shabu House's udon noodles, but I am not there for the noodles. 8. \u00a0They are opened later. \u00a0This is always a plus!  For $7 less per person, all of the above makes it a reasonable place to go to dinner when craving Shabu. But - and this is a BIG BUT - their atmosphere completely ruined it for me. \u00a0Twenty plus year old, rather vulgar and so extremely LOUD people stood around, pushing each other, swearing, and general creating chaos in the middle of the restaurant, in their drunken stupor. \u00a0I am all for having fun, but to ruin other diners' experience to this extent was inexcusable. \u00a0They seemed to know the staff there, and while I understand some exceptions - - if you want your other patrons to come, you have to get a grip on your customers.  I understand the appeal of this place to the younger crowd. \u00a0It's cheaper and you can get just as full. \u00a0But due to it being a younger crowd - their selection of higher-end sake was non-existent, and most opted for the all you can drink w/ hot sake or beer pitchers. \u00a0  If you like beer or hot sake, and you don't mind a ton of havoc around you while eating, then Happy Shabu might be more up your alley compared to Shabu House, for considerably less amount of money. \u00a0If having some sense of calmness around you while eating matters at all to you - \u00a0you can trust me on this: \u00a0you won't like it here.  All in all, I would not be inclined to return to this place except if absolutely necessary. \u00a0I would have given this place a 3.5, but am taking it down to a 2.5 (rounded up to 3) due to the atmosphere in this place.  See? Cheating is NEVER worthwhile!",

    "review_text": "Note - this review is about the refusal to honor the \"free birthday meal\" and the company's refusal to correct its billing.  This restaurant advertises a \"Birthday Free Beef or Chicken Shabu - Party of 6 and more (Must present ID)\" per the company website. My girlfriend held her birthday party at this establishment last night (2/24/11) with a party of 7 and had mentioned when making the reservation that this was for her birthday. At the end of the night when we received the bill, the restaurant had not honored the free meal as advertised both on the website and menu. When we asked them to honor the free meal, the individual in charge of the restaurant told us that they could not reprint the bill and that we would have to pay for the meal. We argued about this for 5-10 minutes with the restaurant representative raising his voice, being short and holding the restaurant's position that a bill cannot be reprinted and that we would therefore have to pay the inaccurate amount on the bill. I guess as not to make a scene, we relented and paid the inaccurate amount.  The restaurant attempted to offer consolation by saying we could get the free meal the next time around and proceeded to hand us a 10% off coupon valid for the next 30 days. Clearly not the same as the $14.95 value of a meal. Obviously, there is no reason to even believe they'd honor a coupon if they don't honor their menu advertisement.  On a side note, the waitress who works at this establishment is really nice - but she is literally asked to do 99% of the work here. The guy who talked down to us and refused to honor the deal literally watched soap operas on his laptop at the bar the entire duration of our stay, while the other guy who slices the meat does only that (this must occupy 5 minutes every hour on average). Meanwhile, the overall service is strained (it's hard to order drinks, get water/tea, etc.) while 2 of the 3 people in sight are standing around refusing eye contact or assistance.   There are other shabu shabu establishments that are just as good if not better in terms of food. You don't need to waste your time/effort here.",

After finding this out, we tried to split our party up, but they still wouldn't let us. Rude. 3) The food was OK.

We got our own personal pots, but instead of a bar for each of us to sit at, it sort of felt like a desk. We were isolated from each other two. 4 Pots, in 2x2 formation. The place was cool though. They gave you plane miso and let you spice it with whatever you wanted. They have an awesome spicy sauce that is not overpowering and very tangy. The meet selection included beef and chicken. For all you can eat, I recommend going all beef. Chicken just seems too risky for such things. And besides boiled chicken is meh. The place was pretty good with service too. But because of the setup of the place it seemed sort of clunky at times. For instance my friend had to wait about 10 minutes before a plate refill since he was stuck behind a rather large group sort of blocking us in.  Overall not a bad place but since I had just found Shabuhouse it wouldn't be fair to rank this place the same as them. Also btw, don't even think about parking at the Safeway across the street. The sign says 1.5 hours, and it really mean 1 hour. We had to go to the towing yard right after dinner.",

Everyone has to be seated on a row as if you're sitting at a bar and you can't really face each other. Four of us were facing the same wall, talking loudly in a desperate attempt to have a conversation.   2) Individual Shabu Shabu pot: This defeats the purpose of Shabu Shabu. It's supposed to be communal meal, shared with friends and family. The sharing aspect is totally ignored.  3) Miso broth: I expect Shabu Shabu to be prepared with dashi (usually seaweed based) broth. That's the traditional way. Miso broth is a little strange . This was a dead giveaway that the owner of this place is most likely not Japanese.

SERVICE: We showed up at 6:30 and the restaurant was pretty empty. \u00a0We asked for a table for two (no reservations) and she said we can sit at the counter. \u00a0I asked if we could sit a table and she said, \"No, they are taken.\" \u00a0However, when another couple came in not too long after us with no reservations, they were seated AT A TABLE! \u00a0Hmmm. \u00a0When I looked at who the waitress was choosing to sit at a table vs. the counter, I felt she was deciding based on race. \u00a0  Service was also based on race as the guys next to us were getting waited on hand and foot and we had to keep asking for more of this and that. \u00a0I have never experienced this before and was quite disappointed this time. \u00a0Service is a hit or miss depending on the day and the waitress. \u00a0  The best part was when three people came in and stated, \"We have reservations for three at 7:00.\" \u00a0The waitress had the nerve to look at me and my boyfriend who were sitting at the counter to see if we were almost done and she did it rudely too. \u00a0The things you notice while sitting at the bar.   FOOD: I always order the all you can eat. \u00a0This time I ordered all you can eat with just chicken and my boyfriend ordered chicken and beef. \u00a0However, she made us share a chicken plate and kept bringing us more. \u00a0I think there should be a price difference if you are only eating one kind of protein vs. two. \u00a0But that silly rule of \"if one person is getting all you an eat, everyone has to.\" \u00a0They have this fear of food sharing! Oh my!  I like the three different sauces they give you and the vegetable platter is plentiful but they over do it on the cabbage.  TV:  I never really paid attention but they had the TV on a gruesome, bloody zombie movie. \u00a0Not good for those who have a weak stomach.",

Food was decent -- the AYCE ($23, with AYCD $35) provided ample quality beef, mushrooms, cabbage, tofu, and two types of noodles. \u00a0Happy Shabu is a few bucks cheaper than Mum's, which is great -- and the quality of food does not suffer as a result...but it's really the only reason it still has 3 stars...

Happy Shabu Shabu pretty much met my expectations of reasonable shabu shabu. It didn't convert me but it didn't disappoint, and was overall a nice experience. Quality of ingredients was pretty decent, everything looked pretty and of the appropriate shade of color. Not marbled meat, but good enough for a $15 one-person shabu shabu pot and plenty. Not enough? There's an abundance of mi-fun noodles and what I guess is supposed to be be udon. That would be my major complaint--the udon. Next to the large stick of carrot (really? bleh), my two least favorite ingredients on the list. Tofu and meat would be the top, but be warned--only two cubes of 1in. x 1in. tofu. Sad. I do want to come back to take advantage of their all-you-can-eat offering, including the all-you-can-drink sake and beer (uh, sake bombs plus pounds of beef? You're on!), about $40 I would guess with tax and tip. That sounds like quite the deal, and is cheaper than another shabu shabu place bookmarked on my list (Cafe Mum's), although Mum's is rated higher (have faith in your fellow Yelpers!)... Definitely time for a comparison. What made the experience memorable despite average food, average sauces and average service, was the combination of steam, two large bottles of Sapporo, cheering with friends who were just getting to know you and were afraid to know any more after realizing hot sake is your equivalent of Dr Hyde's little experiment, and knowing everyone passing by was freezing their tail off. Overall: not experienced enough in shabu shabu to deem this great, but would be back when considering shabu shabu as a destination.",

It was no wonder there was only 2 other people in the entire restaurant on a Friday night!  There were 4 of us going to eat/drink here on a Fri night. Two of us ordered the all you can eat and drink special. Then one of my friends said I will order my own bottle of sake because I already ate. The waiter literally looked at me like I had just landed into his restaurant with a U.F.O. He said, he must sit by himself at the bar across to the restaurant if he wanted to do that. Hew would not even allow my friend to sit at the table across from us saying that he could not seat at a 4-top table. EVEN THOUGH THE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY. He basically told my friend he must go sit at the bar if he wants to order anything unless he orders the \"all you can eat/drink special\". So my friend declined and was forced to watch us all eat and drink for an hour.  Now I must mention that during the entire course of our meal, the 2 straight-faced Japanese punk-rocker waiters were standing 10 feet from our table staring at our every move. Ensuring there is no sharing going on. They would literally stare at me ever time I would touch my cup or plate. We were trying to make the best of the situation and just laugh about it, but these guys literally persisted to watch over our shoulders the entire time. By this point there was no one else in the restaurant (approximately 10pm). So you can imagine how uncomfortable this can make you feel.  If there is a \"happy\" shabu shabu out there, this is not the one. This place should be called \"Retarded Shabu Shabu\", for how stupid these idiots were. They actually told us during our meal that people have been complaining on Yelp about them. HAHA that should've been a red flag right when we ordered.  Anyways, like I said. The food was O.K. But I'm sure there are a million other shabu's to go to that will not require getting the stink-eye during your entire meal.  **NOTE TO OWNER, get some new staff to actually smile at you and make you feel at home when patrons come to your restaurant. This city has way too many options for people to deal with that. Just some advice on p[possibly turning your restaurant around from crickets chirping in there on a Friday night.",

I was told by the waiter that weekdays are slow enough to walk in for a table but you should definitely get a reservation if you're coming in on the weekend.   I was a little intrigued by the individual hot pots because I'm used to sharing a single pot, but it's definitely handy to have your own pot. We did the \"all you can eat\" meal and was very satisified with the quality and quantity of food. Our waiter was very quick to bring out more veggies/meat when we were running low. They also have a vegetarian option for the vegetarians out there.   Overall it was a fun experience and we were extremely satisified (aka stuffed). I recommend Happy Shabu Shabu if you're in the area and craving Shabu Shabu. I will definitely be back here soon!",

I wasn't about to spend that much money, so I just met my friends at the restaurant towards the end of dinner to prevent the hassle. \u00a0We were gonna go out afterwards anyway. \u00a0So I get there, grab a chair, and sit with the group. \u00a0The bday girl gives me a sip of her beer..no big deal. \u00a010 minutes later, the owner comes up to me and asks me if I'm eating or drinking. \u00a0I said, \"no I'm not, but I might order a drink later.\" \u00a0He has the nerve to tell me that he saw me take a sip from my friends cup and that I had to pay $35 like everyone else. \u00a0I pretty much tell him, \"no I'm not paying. \u00a0I'm not drinking with them. \u00a0I will buy my own drink at regular price if thats the case.\" \u00a0He gives up and says, \"I'll pretend I didn't see you drink anything.\" \u00a0Later, my friends are offering me shots of sake and the owner looks at me and then over to them and shakes his head \"no\". 30 minutes later, the owner leaves our area and I'm just walking around our table, sitting, standing, talking to different people. \u00a0They were continuing to take shots while I just sat around and mingled. \u00a0As they are taking shots, my friend points to the owner standing at a distance from behind me. \u00a0I turn around and he was giving me the stink eye, shaking his head, and motioning his hand to the door to let me know that he wanted me to get out. \u00a0I turn around to him and I tell him firmly, \"I AM NOT DRINKING. CALM DOWN!\" \u00a0  I don't understand the purpose as to why he felt the need to hassle me. \u00a0I know I didn't order any food or drink, which may have annoyed him. \u00a0BUT COME ON!!! \u00a0We had a party of over 10 people who all paid $35 each. \u00a0He was making his money for the night. \u00a0RIDICULOUS. \u00a0And what was even more frustrating was that they didn't even give the bday girl her \"free meal\". \u00a0According to the website, the bday person gets a free dinner if they bring a party of 6 people or more. \u00a0The bday girl's bday was at midnight and it was already 10pm. \u00a02 freaking hours away and they weren't even the least bit flexible. \u00a0  Based on service and hospitality alone, I will NEVER step foot inside this establishment again nor will I recommend any of my friends to come here. \u00a0You will get better service and better shabu at Shabu House in the Richmond. \u00a0I've never had anything like that happen to me at any restaurant. \u00a0I can't believe that they are even still in business with bullshit policy like that. \u00a0I can understand getting shitty service from a server, but if the owner is a dick, then what does that tell you on what kind of business he is running? \u00a0THIS PLACE SUCKS and it doesn't deserve any business with service like that. \u00a0RUDE.

    "review_text": "As a lover of shabu shabu, my relationship with Happy Shabu Shabu began with built-in biases. \u00a0This is a great place for shabu shabu with a slightly Korean twist. \u00a0For one thing, they offer kimchi (although they might have ended this tradition) as a banchan. \u00a0In addition to ponzu (soy sauce offset by tart citrus, often yuzu) and goma (sesame seed), they provide a fiery third dipping sauce. \u00a0The latter is made from spicy red chili paste and is a building block for many Korean dishes.  The beef is not Kobe, so let us get that out of the way. \u00a0It is cut ever so slightly thicker and most importantly, lacks the marbling. \u00a0On the positive side, it is less fatty. \u00a0I feel healthy when I eat it. \u00a0(Incidentally, that is why I love shabu shabu in general.) \u00a0The vegetarian platter that accompanies the meat comprises of the usual suspects: \u00a0napa cabbage, a few shiitake mushrooms, some enoki, cubes of tofu, and udon noodles. \u00a0In the broth floats ginseng root, which is another Korean variation.  The service is delightful. \u00a0Once upon a time, there was a Korean waitress who was simply the most adorable lady, but on my last visit, I was sad to hear that she was going to return to Korea.  Finally, the arrangement of the tables and chairs will take some getting used to. \u00a0It is unquestionably one of the most unique and awkward (especially for large parties) set-ups I have ever seen and taken part in. \u00a0I will try to describe it, but this is a case when a picture is optimal. \u00a0All of the tables and chairs are in rows, so that you cannot converse at a normal voice level with anyone other than the person sitting next to you. \u00a0To anyone else in your party, you will have to holler across the rows. \u00a0It gets weird.",

The seating is arranged in rows facing each other across an aisle that servers can walk through easily without having to reach over your head to put down a plate of food. \u00a0This makes for an awkward layout, but after experiencing the cramped all-you-can-eat madness at other places, it's a welcome change. \u00a0There are long picnic tables out front to accommodate larger groups.  In addition to unlimited plates of meat, they provide large platters of veggies and noodles (my favorite are the white noodles... I think they're yam noodles?). \u00a0Each person gets their own pot and 3 different dipping sauces. The spicy sauce is the crowd favorite but I prefer the sesame. Service tends to be pretty good, and the owner comes out and interacts a lot with the customers.  There's a giant Safeway lot across the street but you do run the risk of getting towed.

    "review_text": "Of Mums, Happy, and Shabusen as the three main contenders for shabu shabu in the Japantown area, Happy is the most affordable of them all. They have an all you can eat option, but The AYCE price is actually about the same as Mums, so for that option we'd probably opt for Mums over Happy. Instead, we come to Happy for the single servings for health reasons. Happy can't really decide whether it's Chinese, Korean, or Japanese, so you kind of get a mix of all three in terms of music genre being played, TV show airing, and type of sauce. I'd say that of the three, Happy has my least favorite sesame sauce, but it does have the option of a hot sauce...(thinking that's less of the Japanese and more of the fusion). \u00a0You get your own pot and the service is minimal, but it's nice when you don't want to do dishes that night or fried foods--just drop by Happy Shabu and boil'er-up! :)",

DRUNK...about their sex lives and other things i just don't want to hear about. \u00a0i'm sure the rest of the block heard their conversation also.  anyhoo, can't really take away from a restaurant's overall review because of their customers...so onto the pertinent stuff eh?  the broth was probably the worst broth i've ever had at a shabu shabu restaurant. \u00a0you don't have a choice...and whatever they did serve is not even traditional. \u00a0there was no seaweed...and the broth wasn't clear. \u00a0maybe it was chicken broth or something? \u00a0  the meat was ok...we asked the server if they had kobe beef and she had no idea what we were talking about. \u00a0so we just ordered the regular beef. \u00a0haha. \u00a0it had a good marble...and the portion size was decent. \u00a0  the sauces were way off...the sesame one was super grainy...the regular ponzu sauce tasted strange...like it was fermented or something. \u00a0the spicy sauce was probably the best one out of the 3. \u00a0  the plate of veggies and noodles were plentiful...probably the highlight of the meal. \u00a0i was stoked to see 2 different types of noodles.  the service was mediocre...in the beginning, i think they were super stressed. \u00a0they forgot our drinks...the people at the table in front of us were basically doing jumping jacks to get the server's attention. \u00a0and i had to hear another server rant about how she is not japanese. \u00a0argh.  so all in all...the food and service were just ok...the ambiance is absolutely ridiculous...but it's local...so 3 stars is about right.",

For essentially the same price, the quality of meat as well as the thickness is much better than Shabu Sen or Mum's. In addition, the vegetables and noodles (2 kinds) that accompany your meat selection are a lot more generous and varied. It's nice to know that you're getting some good veggies in your diet when you're pounding a giant plate of beef. In addition to the standard miso and ponzu sauce, they also give you a spicy korean sauce. Finally, for dessert, you also get a complimentary mochi ice cream. The only draw back is that the spacing and seating is uncomfortable. The tables allow very little space for your legs to duck under, and if you have over a party of two, you're either all sitting in a long row or face to face but with a giant space between your tables, making conversation difficult.",

Food, beer, and sake were never low (and we were continuously depleting all of them).   I got the vegetarian all-you-can-eat/drink (2 hour max) and was really happy with the variety of food. There were glass noodles, flour(?) noodles, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, 2 types of squash, broccoli, bok choy, fried and raw tofu, and faux ham and shrimp. The beer and sake were good too, although I don't know what brand.   There were 3 dipping sauces, although i still found the food to be not as flavorful as I would have thought. But maybe I was doing it wrong.   I thought the all-you-can eat was only worth it because of the unlimited beer and sake. I could not even finish a full plate of the veggies/noodles/veggie meats so for the food only it would have been a waste.   Great for groups and celebrations.

    "review_text": "This review is long overdue. \"Happy Shabu Shabu\" is my favorite place... \u00a0I've been going here for the past 3 years. \u00a0Before I moved to San Francisco, I didn't even know what Shabu Shabu WAS, now I can't imagine my life without it....  I still remember the first time I wandered into \"Happy Shabu Shabu\". I didn't know how or what I was supposed to do with the pile of food and bubbling cauldron placed in front of me. I remember dropping a piece of meat into the water and staring at it. I wasn't sure how long it should cook or what order I was supposed to cook this stuff. I was perplexed and intrigued. I just remember leaving the experience feeling like I had discovered something amazing and knowing that I needed to return   I've been to many Shabu Shabu places in the city since then and this one beats them all. \u00a0I will explain why...  1. THE PRICE. $11.99 for the veggie shabu shabu and $14.99 for the beef. The portions are huge! There are noodles, vegetables (Cabbage, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, spring onions, tofu, bok choy, mushrooms..etc) I always leave feeling completely full and happy. I've had shabu shabu that cost more money and I still felt hungry at the end. This is the best deal you're going to find in the city.   2. THE SAUCES! I've noticed most Shabu Shabu places have 2 sauces. A ponzu and a sesame. Happy Shabu Shabu takes it to the next level with 3 sauces. That third sauce is what does it. It's a mildly spicy and tasty chili sauce mix. It goes really well with the Sesame/peanut sauces. The blend of those 2 sauces working together kicks the whole experience to the next level.   3. INDIVIDUAL POTS. You have a warm bubbling pot all to yourself. I've done the group Shabu Shabu thing at other places and I didn't enjoy fishing around in the pot searching for my veggies amidst other people's cooking foods. It was stressful and annoying. I like having my own pot and cooking at my own pace. I feel relaxed when I'm there and I know I can just take my time.  4. STAFF - They're all warm, friendly and efficient. When I come in, they already know my order and they're sliding the tray with everything I need in front of me. The sauces all lined up, the little bowl, the utensils and chopsticks. Little jar of garlic and chives. The pot begins to boil and before I know it I'm happy. If I could eat here, every night. I would! It's really THAT good.   That being said, the seating arrangement is a bit awkward for groups of four. You sit across from each other with a big divide in-between you. This space allows the server to adjust your pot temperature and refill the miso broth. Unfortunately as a result, You have to speak loudly to hear each other. If you have a big group, they can accommodate you. Just make sure you call in a reservation in advance. I usually sit at the bar. It's easiest for 2 people.",

About $15 per person for standard beef shabu shabu that comes with veggies. \u00a0Good portion size, no complaints there. \u00a0However, the dipping sauces here are really lacking. \u00a0There was a peanut sauce that tasted like liquefied peanuts...literally inedible. \u00a0There was something that was basically diluted sirracha. \u00a0Tasty, but no points for originality. \u00a0The final sauce tasted like soy sauce and mirin/sake. \u00a0Boooring. \u00a0When I have shabu shabu, a good dipping sauce is KEY. \u00a0Something like yuzu soy sauce or a tasty hot sauce or a peanut sauce that doesn't taste like circus peanuts.

If they had offered veggie appetizers, rolls, or other such option more substantial than soup, I would have ordered that in addition.   I'm glad they didn't; two plates piled high with fresh tofu, cabbage, mushrooms, bok choy, carrots, and \"veggie ham\" (not listed on the menu) arrived, hot on the heels of a plate full o' raw beef (gag), three pots of hot, mysterious broth (miso?), and three sauces for each of us (sesame, spicy, and something sweet with which you were supposed to accompany green onions).  I tried to stagger the food dropped into the pot to cook appropriately, but to no avail: Everything was mega-cooked before the server returned to turn off the burners. But even then it was delicious. However, charging $12 for a veggie plate that probably cost $2.50 to assemble when I have to cook and season it myself is a little outrageous, especially when they don't stock any to-go containers (what restaurant does that?!).   UPON MY RETURN: I'll bring plenty of money, an extra-empty tummy, and my own Tupperware.",

One of the things that separates this hot pot restaurant from the rest is the table space. Each place setting has its own hot pot station, so you can cook and eat your own food without having others double dip their chopsticks into your pot. The all you can eat here isn't bad either, why get one plate of razor thin beef when you can get three?  And I wouldn't go for the chicken either. Stick to the beef, and ask for the lamb if any's available. And have a blast with the dipping sauces--soy, spicy, and peanut. They're fun to mix and match.",

But onwards. \u00a0 Before taking our order, our waitress, a younger looking Asian girl that looked and talked like a rececnt immigrant, bluntly informed us that we would have to vacate our table and finish eating in exactly one hour because the restaurant had another reservation for the table (nevermind that we too, had a reservation and that the place was completely empty during the entire time we were there). \u00a0I was rather dumbfounded by this \"request\", but since we had to meet some other friends at a bar in about an hour, I didn't protest too much and just said \"fine\".  Our food was served promptly, and the food itself was ok (it's pretty hard to mess up boiling water, uncooked meat and vegetables). \u00a0When we finished with our food, the waitress came back, and rudely told us (and I quote) \"It's been one hour, you guys need to leave now. \u00a0Can I bring check?\". \u00a0At this point I was getting a little irritated, but because everyone was basically done and it was time for us to get on with our evening, I said (rather irritated), \"yes, fine.\"  Upon getting the check we noticed that one of our meals (for the birthday person) hadn't been comp'd (as their website promises for parties of \"6 AND More\"). \u00a0I brought this up with our waitress, and she rudely responded, \"you need seven people for that\". \u00a0I said, \"No, on your website it says 6 AND More...\" and then pulled out my Iphone and their website to prove my point. \u00a0Her response, in broken English and a blank stare was, \"Yes. \u00a07 people.\" \u00a0This was the last straw, so I demanded to speak with her manager, as the last time I checked \"AND\" is an INCLUSIVE word, which meant 6 people was all that was required to qualify for hte deal.  The waitress went back and upon return, told us that she had taken care of the free birthday meal. \u00a0However, upon further review of the bill, I now noticed that they tacked on an 18% Gratuity charge. \u00a0So yeah, the birthday person's meal was free, but now I had to pay an additional 18% gratuity for a place with piss poor service that didn't deserve a tip!  I complained again, only to get dumb stares in return from our waitress so I finally just gave up and paid the 18% gratuity since we were now running late and I didn't want to stick around and argue with these people for the rest of the night. \u00a0I slapped down my credit card, she took it back, charged it and returned it. \u00a0I signed my name and gave them NO additional tip, then started flipping the receipt over (as I usually do). \u00a0As soon as I did that, the waitress grabs the receipt from my hand, flips it over again while I'm still sitting at the table, notices that I gave them no additional tip, YANKS the receipt from me, and gives me an evil look, then storms away. No thank you for your business, have a good night, nothing. \u00a0Just up and left.  This place is far from being Happy. \u00a0And I certainly was NOT Happy. NEVER coming to this place again. \u00a0The staff are Shabu Shabu Nazis.",

I'd never yet tried the shabu experience and I was left feeling underwhelmed. The chicken didn't seem as fresh as the beef combo, and despite the fact we were cooking the food ourselves, the meal overall was pretty bland. I did dump all sorts of seasoning and sauces on my meat and veggies, and still felt that it tasted like sopping wet tastless food. I also do not think they provide enough noodles.  My boyfriend was glad that we didn't get the all you can eat, because although he was still hungry after eating everything, he wasn't sure if he would have enjoyed more blandness. I think shabu is pure novelty, and that's what you pay for. If you want something tasty, perhaps try something else.",

WHOSE TABLE WAS NEVER EMPTY OF BEEF, ENOKI MUSHROOMS AND ALL THAT GOODNESS!? shit.. i probably could have bled to death and passed out before they even take my fucking order.

There was our table of 6, a table of 3 behind us, and a large group of about 10 so the restaurant was not packed. WHERE THE FUCK WERE HIS VEGETABLES?

The restaurant wasn't too crowded and we decided to sit at the bar as you'd still had to sit side by side at the tables which is kinda a lil odd.   Menu includes al la carte or all you can eat beef, pork or seafood. We ordered 2x beef option. It came with ample veggies, tofu, noodles. Price was reasonable \u00a0$16.99 per order. I liked the way they freshly cut the beef just before serving.   They only had the miso as the soup base. (No spicy miso!) it was pretty okay and portions are quite big.   Nothing great but reasonably priced with good ingredients. They should improve the taste of the soup and it will make a difference. Ah also please serve the draft beer cold!   The greatest perk was the yelp deal $25 for $35. With this offer, 2x beef &amp; two Sapporo pint came to $9.68 before tip. Pretty good deal, aye?   Oh also don't forget to check in for the free dumplings to dunk into your shabu shabu!",

Get to the restaurant, and of course, we are sharing pots. I guess making a reservation doesn't really matter. Then I asked him if we can just sit at the tables then so we can just have own pots, and he says no, those are for parties or reservations. I remind him I made a reservation, and he just says no. You're at the counter. Tired of this man's attitude already, I just sat at the counter.  Got the all you can eat option, and that was worth the frustration that the manager caused. Unfortunately, my pot was not boiling the entire time, making me sit and wait for my meat to cook for a much longer time. Asked our waiter to turn it up a bit, then 2 minutes later the manager would come and turn it down. I gave up.  If you sit at the counter, good luck finding room to fit your plates of food. I was so cramped, and my shoulder was aching due to the fact that the pot is extremely far away when you share.  The manager is rude, and doesn't talk to people very nicely, nor does he answer questions you may have.  Next time, I'd rather pay the extra bucks and go to my favorite Shabusen. At least they have amazing service and are some of the nicest people.",

It's a big stovetop-heated broth into which you throw ingredients from your (HUGE) plates, and cook each item as long as you want. The variety of dipping sauces, and the broth are excellent compliments to how fresh the food is. If you're not normally one for adventurous dining, I'd say try this place first.

Unless it's Espetus or The Buffet @ The Wynn, I really don't care for All-You-Can Eat establishments because they tend to be filled with low quality food soaked in fat and laced with enough salt to give me instant heart palpitations. However, this is the quite opposite of HSS, the food is just completely TASTELESS which to me is just as bad.  On Sunday, December 26th, my friends and I (party of 3) came to HSS at 6:30 PM and were promptly seated without reservations. In an effort to shorten my novel of reviews, I'll just give a quick summary:  P R O S: *AFFORDABLE FOR THE PRICE SENSITIVE CONSUMERS. AYCE for $22.95 (Beef, Chicken and Veggies) and AYCE&amp;D (Beer, House Sake, and Soda) for $34.95.  *FRESH WELL-MARBLED BEEF. Tender but NOT high-grade quality \"melt-in-your-mouth\" tender.  *INDIVIDUAL COOKING POTS  C O N S: *TASTELESS BROTH. The broth was SO watered down that it tasted like water with brown/yellow food coloring.  *BLAND SAUCES -Ponzu: Watered down flavorless colored water -Sesame: Watered down flavorless paste -Chili: Chunky and so salty that it masked the spiciness of the chilies  *ROCK HARD CLUMP OF FROZEN DUMPLINGS from your local Asian market.  *AWKWARD &amp; STRATIGICALLY ILLOGICAL SEATING ARRANGEMENTS. \u00a0Individual burners are adjacent to each. If you go with a party of 2, 3 or 4 you will be seated in a straight line and if you want to even have a conversation, you will have to turn and YELL to your left or right which makes it impossible for person #1 to talk to #3 or #4 and vice versa.   Imagine that with a bunch of rowdy drunktards doing the AYCE&amp;D. Yah, no thanks!  *BAD SERVICE. I had to ask 3-4 TIMES for water and rice when there were only 2 tables (party of 3) there. Enough said.  If you're looking for flavorful and high-quality AYCE &amp; AYCE&amp;D Shabu Shabu with far superior service, shell out a couple more dollars ($7 more for AYCE and $5 more for AYCE&amp;D) and go to Shabu House on Geary/15th instead...it will be WELL WORTH IT!!!",

That's still no excuse to lie to your customers, serve sub-par meat, or water down your sauce.  1) Their menu says clearly: birthdays free for parties of 4 or more. We tell them it's my birthday at the beginning of the meal, at the end of the meal they card me to confirm, then when the check comes out they say, \"Sorry we changed that to parties of 6 or more\". I didn't even get the overpriced All-you-can-eat.   It's not about the money, it's the principle. Don't advertise and sell something to your customers, then change it up at the end of the meal. It says something about the place. What else are they skimping on?  2) The quality of the food is mediocre at best. The sesame sauce is strangely bitter, not sweet enough, and very watered down. The ponzu sauce is passable. The meat is sliced too thin and not very marbled so it ends up tough and tasteless. The vegetables are fine. Garlic is chopped up in huge chunks that are way too big.  I'm a shabu-shabu aficionado. It's my favorite food in the world. I'd give this place a 4 out of 10.",

There are a couple of negative things that bring the score down: for one, the cold (literally...BRRR!) and sterile atmosphere. And while we're on the topic of sterile, how about the overwhelming odor of lysol that was eminating from the bathroom that they decided to scrub down 2/3 of the way through our meal. The bathroom was already pretty damn sparkly before that. I also encountered an odd, unplacable odor when I first entered.  Ah, well. The people that work there are EXTREMELY nice and attentive. It's BYOB--which I don't necessarily prefer, but it was nice to save some money on a night out for once--and they even provided an ice bucket for the bottle of champagne I brought (WARNING: there are no bottle openers or corkscrews of any kind at the establishment). Also, you don't have to hide your booze as you do at some other BYO estabs. I dig the individual hot pots, and the veggies, dips, and broth flavorings (fresh chopped garlic &amp; onions + miso) were spot on. The beef was nothing special--it was still slightly frozen when they brought it out and wasn't as high in quality as Mum's--but it tasted just fine when cooked. Overall, I prefer Mum's and the $35 all you can eat and drink special, but happy shabu shabu got the job done during Mum's remodling closure.",

Tons of delicious veggies and noodles, three dipping sauces, and beef with delicious miso broth. We had to ask for the rice, which was about average.  Excellent service and friendly staff!!

It's about $22 per person for the all you can eat food only but if you want the drink &amp; food combo then it's about $34!  You get a choice of either beef or chicken for the AYCE and another plate full of noodles and veggies like napa cabbage, bok choy, carrots, and tofu.   However, the sauces were a little lame, the peanut sauce was watered down and the ponzu sauce tasted too much like alcohol, like they mixed it with too much sake. So i created my own by mixing the watered down peanut sauce and the spicy sauce, which was good by the way!  I would have given this place perhaps 2 stars but because of the AYCE option, I opted for the 3. Although the service was good when it was given, it was hard to get the attention of the worker since he seemed to be always hiding in the back coming out occasionally to greet new customers or fill water for another large table.   In the end, my boyfriend and I both had three plates of beef each so I would say we both got our money's worth, haha!  **You get your own hot pot, that's a plus!",

    "review_text": "Outside of Japan, I have only been to one other shabu shabu restaurant and it was ok. The other night I decided that shabu shabu (and all you can drink) sounded like a great idea and some Yelp results gave me Happy Shabu Shabu.  The fun started out with wandering around the Fillmore area in chilling winds trying to find where the hell this restaurant was. Google Maps showed it IN the Safeway mall. This is a lie. It is ON Fillmore, across the street from the Safeway mall.  When we got there at 9pm on a Saturday evening, it was surprisingly empty. There were maybe 4-5 other customers and another set of 2 walked in behind us. We were seated and the 2 girls behind us got seated.. across from us. At first I was wary because the table had a 1 ft gap between us and the girls and I thought I'd be annoyed at having to listen to them, but I couldn't hear them at all. Good for me, but I can see how a party of 4 would complain about that seating arrangement, as I read in other reviews.  Service was really attentive - our veggie and beef plates came soon after we ordered. Sapporo came in a pitcher and each of us got our own sake. The waitress was quick to come back when our plates/cups/soup looked low and even though we had finished eating and were finishing up a second pitcher, we didn't feel rushed by the staff to leave :)  The beef itself is fine. it's not kobe beef, it's not awful fatty, either. You can ask the waitress to customize your veggie/noodle platter to your liking. The soup looked like miso, but wasn't.  Curiosity: after the first pitcher of beer and sake I wandered to the restroom. While washing my hands, I noticed they had two mirrors - one at eye level for normal sized people like you and me, and one at crotch level. I'm going to assume this isn't a crotch mirror - instead, I'll think that it is a mirror for handicapped (or small Asian) people. All-you-can-drink makes you think a lot about stuff like that.  Tip: put loads of garlic and green onion in your soup in the beginning to start making it flavorful!",

Minuses * We came with a group of 14 people. One of my friends made a reservation a day in advance. The morning of our reservation, we were told our reservation would have to be pushed back. When we arrived for our late dinner, we still had to wait for over 45 minutes, because a group of loud, drunk Asians were taking their sweet time paying and TAKING PICTURES. They weren't even eating at this point, so the staff really should have politely asked them to clear out rather than keeping us waiting for so long.  * Bad layout. The two people on the innermost ends of the table sat facing large pillars and couldn't see across to the other side without leaning sideways. Awkward!  * The broth wasn't very flavorful. We threw in a lot of hot sauce and chili peppers to give it a boost. The refills diluted the broth even more.  * Two people to a pot. Not a great arrangement if anybody in the group has dietary restrictions.  Pluses * Our waitress was great. She was funny and quick and remained a couple of steps ahead of us by proactively asking if we wanted more plates of meat or vegetables. * The owner (I think) came out halfway through our meal. He seemed drunk and stood between our two tables, babbling and pouring us strong Chinese liquor for free. Quite entertaining.  Other Notes  * Restaurant enforces a fairly standard policy of not allowing only part of the group to order all-you-can-eat, although they were flexible about allowing half the group to order all-you-can-drink. Unfortunately, we had to fight pretty hard for the single vegetarian in the group to pay the vegetarian shabu shabu price. She had to vehemently swear she wouldn't eat any of the meat. Shabu shabu places I've been to with better service are usually generous about giving discounts to vegetarians, especially when only one person in the group claims to be one. * The selection of meats, vegetables, and dipping sauces is pretty standard.",

I thought it was a cafe at first lol I was suprised that it was a shabu shabu . \u00a0All-you-can-eat for about $22 which is pretty affordable and your money's worth if you ask me . The beef was good . Didn't really like the chicken though .. because it was chicken breast . The noodles and rice were pretty good as well . They give you a side of kimchee as well . The dipping sauces were really good esp. the red one . This place is pretty clean too and the coolest thing is that everyone gets their own pot !! The dessert was just perfect to top it all off . Not too sweet but just enough to hit the spot . It was fresh watermelon and honeydew juice with tapioca . The service was just amazing .. very friendly people . They \u00a0stop by every now and then to remove the stuff on top of the boiling water and to ask if you need more beef , dipping sauces , etc. The owner or whoever it was even asked us at the end of our meal if there was anything they can improve on . We told him we didn't like the chicken and he put in consideration of using black meat instead of using white meat meaning meat from the thigh and other parts of the chicken instead of chicken breast . They close at 10 but we stayed until 10:30ish which was when they were cleaning up and everything . They didn't try to rush us to finish or pay the bill . Their service was still just as good as it was at first . I give them props for that because usually people make you pay and leave . This is now my favorite shabu shabu joint and I must admit this place really suprised me .. it was more than I expected . I'm definitely coming back again !",

THE. BAR. i let it go, and we sat at the bar.  i ordered the all you can eat ($24/person) and a large sake and sapporo. the sake and beer, you really can't mess that up. the food itself, decent. all you can eat comes with beef, chicken, and veggies. the three sauce combo was good; consisted of a paenut based suace, a hot sauce, and a soy/teriyaki sauce. ready for THE RINGER?!? here we go...  ten minutes into sitting down, TWO GIRLS walk in. they asked to sit at a table. you remember the tables for parties of 8 or more i mentioned? yeah those. were they, too, ushered to THE BAR? nooooo, THEY WERE SEATED! oooooh, child. boy was lucky i was on a date, otherwise all hell was going to break loose.  besides the awkward layout and the fact that we were ushered to THE BAR instead of being seated at a table because we were gay guys on a date and not girls and the fact that i was LIED to, the food was alright.  thank God for my patience and undrestanding for not blowing up in front of my date and ruining the rest of the night.  shout out to the server in th red sweater last night with the poor k-pop harcut, because of YOU, i am NOT coming back. nor should ANYONE ELSE.",

Pork tasted as if it was chopped from a 78 year old dead pig no one remembered to bathe the first 77 years of its life. The scallop wannabe lookalike chicken tasted disgustingly bad like rotten eggs.

    "review_text": "We've been going here for years. With groups of 10-20 people. We've brought a lot of business to this place and last night was our last time there. Sometime during our loyal years, they instituted a rule that if one person orders all you can eat, then everyone has to. We've adhered to this policy over the years and have remained loyal customers, despite their lack of trust for us. There were only four of us this time, the four people who have brought them a majority of their business through the years. For once, my friend only wanted a vegetarian meal, my husband and her boyfriend wanted all you can eat. We were at the table which was split two and two across from each other, so it would have been obvious if she was snagging pieces. I offered to even just order a beef plate (instead of all you can eat) and sit on the side with her. The tables are considered two separate tables, but the management is so obtuse, we were brought with the excuse they couldn't do that since the order was already put in.  We changed the order, instead of having 3 all you can eat/drinks and a vegetarian, everyone each had a plate and one drink.  Happy Shabu Shabu is going to fail as a business. In a city with great food and better Shabu Shabu places, they just lost an entire large group of people who brought in so many businesses during the years. Business that would come even when their restaurant was empty. We spread the word and had our friends go (even without us) and we are just as easily going to spread the world telling everyone to go elsewhere. Maybe next time the owners give a business a shot, they'll learn to be more customer focused. Especially to those who have showed so much loyalty.",

There were nine people in our party - everyone except me and my boyfriend ordered the all you can eat/drink. \u00a0After explaining to the waiter (manager?) that we didn't want the all you can eat/drink, he essentially accused of having the intent of ordering the normal meal and then drinking the alcohol of our friends \"on the side.\" \u00a0And this was after my boyfriend tried to order his own alcoholic beverage, and was informed that the only way he would be served alcohol is if he ordered the all you can eat/drink. \u00a0  the food was nothing special.  when the bill came, we asked the waiter to split the bill between all of the people evenly. \u00a0Somehow I received a bill that was more than other people's bills (90 bucks!) (and I did not get the all you can eat/drink). \u00a0Because it was a friend's birthday, others gave me cash to make up the difference between what I should have paid and what I was charged, and someone else was already in some sort of dispute w/ the manager, I let it go. \u00a0Although thinking of it today, I think that it is possible that he charged the party as though my boyfriend and I got the all you can eat, when we did not. \u00a0I don't know that for sure though.  I would never go back again. \u00a0In addition to the food being nothing special, I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome the whole time.  Also, I wouldn't recommend going here for a group event, because the design and placement of the cooking tables do not allow you to sit close enough to those you are facing to carry on a conversation (without yelling). \u00a0Our party was essentially split into two groups, and the birthday person couldn't talk to half of her party.

I felt like family coming in here, I think it's a family owned business...not sure. Workers greeted us &amp; they were also nice &amp; attentive.  I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO COME HERE!!!!!!!!!!! I've walked by once (it wasn't open yet, open at 5pm?) after seeing it on yelp, I never knew where it was located until I went to go sing K, which was across the street.  Today Sarah L., the fam &amp; I went for my popo's birthday. Popo never likes to go to restaurants for her bday, but I guess someone convinced her. I remember wanting to come on my birthday or some other event last year, but I didn't, I don't remember why. I kept this bookmarked since the beginning of the year. I saw pictures on yelp that celebs came here to eat, I wanted to come even more. I found yesterday we were coming here, I was SO EXCITED, couldn't contain my happiness. I have never gone to a restaurant to hot pot with family before, wait...I have, BUT that was years ago.  When you first walk in, there is a bar and to the left of the bar are tables with individual hot pots. Tables had rows of 4? but we sat on the side, so there were rows of 2 &amp; they faced each other.  Pros or con: Seats are in rows/bar/diner-like fashion. I'm all for only having to talk to 2 people (whoever is on my right &amp; left side), because of my anti-social tendencies. In the beginning I was hesitant not sharing a pot, but I ended up liking it. Didn't fight for food, made my VERY OWN soup.  My fav items were the fish ball things with fish eggs (10minutes to cook), thinly sliced beef (the kind you would shabu shabu), mushrooms, squid &amp; mussels were good too. Beef was so red &amp; fresh, it really did look marbled, like this <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2Tghf3Jcnr69rWdgljqonQ?select=PEyHADp3nH0pXjTCnI3KjQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/2Tgh\u2026</a>  Shrimp didn't have shell on the body, just the head, so the heads fell off when you boiled it too long? Suck the shrimp head, yummm <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2Tghf3Jcnr69rWdgljqonQ?select=v5N30emxPlwKE8EzWRJalg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/2Tgh\u2026</a>  Cousin only ate beef, his soup was so good, tasted like beef stew.  Sauces were good too, the soy sauce looking one with green onions was probably my fave. Chili on the table if you want it spicy, I can't eat spicy so I couldn't use it.  If you bring kids, make sure you keep an eye on them. I can imagine kids wanting to put stuff in the pot &amp; burning themselves OR asking if their food is ready yet.  Drinking all the hot pot soup always makes me want to pee A LOT, make sure you're always near a toilet after you eat. The restroom was nice, clean &amp; smelled nice. Any restroom like that gets an extra star.  After shabu shabu-ing, with the right people &amp; places to go, it was the perfect Saturday. It felt like I was on summer break, didn't worry about the midterms next week. This should have been my 200th review, owell.",

You can add your own green onions and/or garlic.   The beef was well marbled and looked in good quality. Much better than the beef I got at Little Sheep. I did not order any chicken, but why? I eat chicken everyday. They also include a vegetable and noodle plate which consisted of cabbage, mushroom, and glass noodles. Dip with the 3 sauces if you like.   The beer and sake really filled me up and gave me a good buzz. Perfect because we were planning to head over to the Sens club venue after. I love going to a club smelling like beef. mmmm. The girls dig it. ;p   The servers were not as attentive as we would have liked. Our beer glasses were constantly empty. Maybe if they hired more than 2 servers?   Now I need to try Shabu house, but they are always packed to max capacity. Someday... :(  Price:39.99 pp",

A word about the service, there were two servers - one was friendly, efficient, and eager, while the other was... not. \u00a0But the good thing about shabu shabu is that the service has less impact on the quality of your meal. \u00a0If you see other reviews that comment on the service, just consider that I had one that acted as though she owned the place (in a good way), while the other acted like her mom owned the place (i.e. she was forced to work and couldn't care less).  It's good to know that when I want shabu shabu but don't have time to wait at other places like Shabu House, that there's always an option. \u00a0It's like if you really, really want Zachary's Pizza, but decide that that line is too long, so you go to the Round Table across the street. \u00a0Sometimes that's OK (and sometimes it's not).  PROS: - No wait, plenty of seating - Clean, great vegetables (and noodles are included)  CONS: - Dipping sauces weren't the best - Broth wasn't flavorful",

The couple times I've come here, it's always been a good time. \u00a0The seats are sort of far from each other so with a group of 8, you may have to sit 4 and 4 with bar seating facing each other. You get your own pot, service is mediocre but they let you run free with you AYCE/D. \u00a0You can get out of your seat, mingle with your friends, be as obnoxious as you want and they won't kick you out. \u00a0It's shabu-tastic!  Also, the owner seems to love groups who come to his restaurant for drunken celebration and warning, he will try to drink with you! \u00a0He will offer you what my friends and I call \"fire water.\" It comes in a unlabeled glass bottle and is a clear liquid that smells like rubbing alcohol. It is very strong, burns anything it touches and may actually kill you if you drink enough of it.  Ok, I made the last part up.   But I have had friends take shots of this fire water with the owner and end up really sick in the bathroom and outside the restaurant. Boo. Honestly, the food and service both are not great. They never refill your soup if you ask, and take forever to bring out more meat, but they will provide plenty of sake.",

I didn't like the peanut sauce, but the other 2 were BOMB so I could overlook that! Besides, I'm not a peanut sauce fan.  I'm looking for others to dine with me.

    "review_text": "Came here the evening of Valentines day with a party of 4. The venue was a lot smaller then anticipated but we were seated right away even when our entire party wasn't present yet, and my original reservation was for only 2. (You would think all restaurants would be packed for Valentines day evening, but not Happy Shabu Shabu).   Every person gets their own boiling pot, but the seating arrangement was quite disappointing. Our party of 4 had to sit in one row facing another party of strangers. The only people that could really converse are the two sitting in the middle of the table, but good luck trying to talk to the person at the far end.   I believe their popular option is the \"all you can eat all you can drink\" for $34.99. One member of our party did get this and they were quite consistent in bringing him more plates of meat and refilling his beer. They also have a \"all you can eat\" option for those less alcoholics in mind.  I decided to get the half beef half chicken option for $14.99. They bring you a plate of meat and a plate of vegetables. I kept forgetting the water is boiling hot and trying to stick burning hot vegetables in my mouth wasn't the smartest idea. In my opinion, the beef tasted way better than the chicken, even when I usually prefer chicken in other scenarios. After being cooked, the chicken tasted very hard and dry. The beef was softer and carried a bit more flavor. The sauces provided where not the greatest, especially the peanut butter flavored one.  In conclusion, this place is great if you want to eat as much and/or drink as much as you want for a set price, but don't care too much to converse with your party because you will not be facing them. It seemed to work out great for the people who just sat there and ate and drink without talking to their dates! The prices are a little higher compared to other Shabu restaurants in the city, so choose wisely before settling.",

They don't slow play you at all with the beers and if you strike up a conversation with your server they will give you all the fire water you want. Sauces could be more flavorful but overall the food is good.  I have read reviews complaining about the service. These servers have personality and take it just as good as they give it. They are having fun and some of the up tight patrons need to loosen up and have a good time with them. If you are going to place that is all you can eat and drink what are you expecting service wise?

A note on the owner/manager/guy that was there - we'd like to call him \"Stan\" because he reminded us of our friend. \u00a0He was awesome! \u00a0He's who I talked to when I called to make the reservation. \u00a0He was really easy to work with and told me I could bring a cake in and they would serve it. \u00a0When I got there, he moved us to the back table because there was only six of us. \u00a0He gave my fiance a free beer and took shots of sake with us. \u00a0Talk about hospitality! \u00a0He let me go in the back to get the cake and convinced me to put 30 plus candles on the cake and helped me light them, and then helped me serve it to our guests. \u00a0I appreciate the extra mile of service and can't wait to go back to hang out with \"Stan.\"  Overall a great experience. \u00a0We were full afterwards.",

I am a person who really enjoys having control of my meal, so obviously my self-contained boiling pot of broth was a TREAT to manage as I cooked up various meats &amp; veggies. I also am obsessed with sauces, so imagine the joy of having 3 varieties that you can also spruce up with onions &amp; garlic at your leisure. Basically, it's a control freak's dream. Add in the luxury of unlimited sake bombs throughout the duration of your meal, and what's not to like?  The only reasons I couldn't go 5 stars is that if you have a group, you have to sit kinda far from each other and shout across a mini-canyon to make yourselves heard. Also, the manager roams around with \"fire water\" shots that make you feel like you MAY die after you take it. It's probably like, windex or something.

I don't think AYCE is worth it here and there are plenty of better quality places with more of a selection in the city but for what we got and paid, it was good.
