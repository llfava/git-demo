The great thing about Revolution is that it probably reflects what this whole \"Mission hipster\" thing was SUPPOSED to be. A nice little communist theme, a cafe with tea, espresso, beer, wine, sangria, and mojitos, good conversation with typically-like-minded individuals, and some really, really, independent music (sometimes too independent).  They've got great beer (chimay, boont amber, etc. on tap), a limited wine selection, and supposedly great sangria. I even like their darn lemon-herb tea bags.  This place is in it's element on a weeknight, where the locals are out, having just a drink or two, talking, smoking, being their mission hipsters selves. Whenever I go, I almost believe I could be one too. It's romantic that way.",

First - the people next to us showed attitude about us sitting there, as if their invisible friends were already sitting there or something. \u00a0Didn't please Mr. Rob at all - and just made him scoot in even closer.  Second, Jon observed then commented that the three people next to us all were wearing the same thick black-rimmed glasses. \u00a0Brad Pitt couldn't make those rims cool, but all three sported them nonetheless, apparently thinking it worked for them. \u00a0(It didn't.) \u00a0They frantically wrote (or drew) in their black notebooks, intermittently smoking a cigarette, without speaking a word while the music blared from the live band and conversations took place everywhere. \u00a0It was like a scene out of \"A Beautiful Mind\" - except it wasn't.  Then....  All of a sudden.....  \"SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! \u00a0SHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\"  Uh - what?

These musicians know exactly what they are doing. so, back to my review about Revolution Cafe.  It reminds me of a middle eastern cafe. The decor is basic: small space, random chairs and tables spread out, simple menu, dark, filthy restroom, but always full of open people, wine stained floors, conversation, great music, outstanding memories.

Revolution Cafe offers a laid-back bar/cafe atmosphere, great music, and adorable little tables just large enough to prop your Apple laptop of choice.   The downside? For a cafe as wired as Revolution, there sure are a surprising lack of outlets. Regardless, the wireless signal is reliable, and the tap selection \u00a0is respectable, if a bit on the slim side.",

Given the chill atmosphere at this place, the live music, outdoor seating, etc, I give back 2 of the lost stars. I really do like this place. It's the attitude of the staff I could previously do without.  \"I would've rated this place at least 4 stars before. \u00a0Not so after the outrageous service (or lack thereof) I received. \u00a0I was becoming a regular here, ever since moving just a few blocks away. It's such a cool place in so many ways. It's equally a great place to kick back with an espresso as it is to pass the afternoon with a glass of wine or sangria. \u00a0The live music makes it even better. \u00a0 I should've known it was too good to be true. And after this morning, now I do. \u00a0  Having a couple of hours to kill this Sunday morning, I set out for the Revolution cafe, thinking I'd start off the day by grabbing a light brunch and coffee. \u00a0So, I get to the cafe around 11:00 &amp; it wasn't yet busy. Great, I thought, I can still get a table AND won't have to wait forever to get something to eat. I put in my order, wait 15 minutes or so &amp; out it comes. But, wait, that's not what I ordered. I tell the girl who brings it out &amp; she referred me to the girl at the counter where I had ordered. When I (very politely) explained to her that she had gotten my order wrong, she had the AUDACITY to tell me that \"Oh well, she made a mistake\" but that it \" was now made\" and she \"wasn't going to waste it\". Uh, ok, what does that mean? She then explained that she would not make what I had ordered &amp; that if I didn't want what had been brought to my table, she would just give me my money back!!!!! This is a true story. \u00a0SINCE WHEN did baristas in cafes in this city reserve the right to serve you whatever they wanted, regardless of what you ordered, and then expect you to just shut up and eat it!!?? I responded \"you mean you won't make my order?\" and she just ignored me. I was so in shock at having received such incredibly rude and awful service that I didn't think to do what I should have done: take back the $3 tip that I had put in the jar upon ordering (on a \u00a0$13 bill no less!) \u00a0So, despite the fact that I love so much about this cafe, I will simply NEVER be back. What a shame. My friends and I used to love this place.\"",

As a bonus you can even switch up and drink beer while smoking cigarettes. Hell, you can probably smoke whatever the hell you please, and drink wild amounts of nipple milk. It's all-round smokey drink fest.  However you will need to overcome that creeping sensation that you are about to be assailed by a dreadlocked student of vague European decent who will talk about Manu Chao for three hours and then show you his paintings of a hash farm in Morocco. Sure, there's plenty of wi-fi-riders and local trendies to balance things out, but, on the whole, it feels like somewhat of a hippie outpost.  Yes, there's definitely something a little crusty about the place. I stay away from it at night as most of live music I've heard walking past has sounded suspiciously like a giant hippie jam band wankfest. Not a big fan of the service either - a bit disinterested? Annoyed? Surly? Inattentive? Can't put my finger on it exactly, but they are generally a little on the lame side.

Papa Toby's is the kinda place where skinny dudes who look alike hang out with skinny chicks who look alike. they share DEEP THOUGHTS about the 3 books they've read (undoubtedly one eggers, one murakami and probably something by a bad beat writer), watch a french film they don't understand and rub up against each other...ugh, i don't even want to know what happens after that but I'm pretty sure it involves vanilla sex and more DEEP THOUGHTS. \u00a0normally i can roll with the hipsters, sometimes i even sleep with them and have long term relationships with them, but FUCKING A, this place makes me want to turn all Firestarter and burn the shit down. \u00a0I don't know, I'm having a bitter day, obviously. \u00a0I'm petitioning for this ballot initiative for the Humane Society that's basically asking for animals on factory farms to have enough room to sit down, stand up, turn around and stretch their limbs or spread their wings within their enclosures (and do hokey pokey if they so desire). \u00a0Seems like common fucking sense, I know, but in reality none of our existing animal laws extend to animals on farms. \u00a0ANYWAY, we need 650,000 signatures by February to get it on the ballot and we only have 100,000 so far so WE'S DESPERATE FOR SIGS. So I'm out there every lunch break, after work and on weekends, basically prostituting myself for the animals. Don't think too hard on that last sentence, I don't want you to puke. \u00a0Okay so, a SWHB (Skinny White Hipster Bitch) gave me a hard time when I was petitioning out front of Papa Toby's because I interrupted her giving blow job advice (!!!) to a gay dude she obviously wanted to bone. \u00a0When asked politely if she would care to sign something so that the ANIMALS CAN TURN IN A CIRCLE, she says all snotty like, \"Can't you see I'm busy?!\" \u00a0So I'm all, \"Oh it will only take a second.\" \u00a0And she's all, \"Didn't you hear me the first time? \u00a0I said, I'M BUSY.\" \u00a0And so I'm all, \"YOU ARE A BAD PERSON!!!!*\" and run home to cancel my evening plans and drink alone. \u00a0And I guess that's why I'm like, the worst at petitioning. \u00a0Oh and if anyone wants to go petitioning with me, it's tons of fun so please email me! \u00a0I'm totally serious! \u00a0Afterwards, I will buy you a drink and listen to your blow job advice and laugh at your jokes and be best fake date ever. \u00a0We will RULE THE WORLD TOGETHER. (more info here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhumanecalifornia.org%2F&amp;s=7753c59e794e04d57a4adf46a4a40fc404cdecfaa64bc9b35bb720769e32d596\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">humanecalifornia.org</a>)  *But what I'd really wish I'd said was this something alone these lines: \u00a0\"Listen, bitch. I know you don't want to sign this because you don't want this guy to know that chick who is so down she can loudly give BJ advice in a crowded cafe is from Fresno and I'm sorry that your face looks like it belongs to a dude and this fool over here ain't buying what you're selling because he's been checking out my amazing cheek bones this entire time BECAUSE HE'S A MOMO and you want me to go away and stop being the salt in your game because let's face it, he'd rather be staring at THIS but i ain't leaving I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE NO NO NO WAY until you sign this g-d petition because baby, I LOVE ANIMALS. \u00a0and that includes you, heifer.\"",

If you are a big fan of comfortable lounges and outstanding customer service I would not recommend this place. It took a while for the bartender to acknowledge the existence of people at the bar.

    "review_text": "This is one of the coolest hangout spots in the Mission. With an open patio and kick back environment, this caf\u00e9 offers an exciting list of drinks that ranges from wines, cocktails and beers on tap to an array of espressos and lattes. I came here last night but it was super crowded so I had to return earlier today in order to grab a seat by the door. With an antiquated wooden floor, wobbly small tables, wide open doors and windows, and wall to wall of artsy photographs, the vibe is young and vibrant. Next to the bar is a group of five women studying away while those seated on the open patio are chucking on their tall glass of beer and people watching. Noticeably crowding the right side of the room is the five laptop users including myself. The combination of free WiFi and happy hours equals happy times and happy vibes. It's been hours since I've been sitting here but at the end of the day the place is just getting started with a pronounced singles scene and cool music blaring in the background.   This is my second visit this week. A person who was feasting on an impressive looking lox bagel next to me earlier said, \"This place is not known for its food but people come here for the vibe.\" Their espresso drinks are not Philz-like but better than many of the places I've been. Today I tried their barbeque pork sandwich ($6.75) that came pressed hot with a decent portion of bbq pork dressed in a semi sweet and savory sauce and melted cheddar. Portions were good and it came with a side of fresh greens with a light balsamic dressing that was enough to hold me till dinner. Pretty good, nothing revolutionary, but it does get me by.   Unlike other cafes, they also show films every Monday night. I was here last Monday evening and the packed house cheered on for the filmmaker as I sat in the dark little corner going through rounds of NFL fantasy draft. At first I thought the presence of my laptop and bright screen would irk those seated nearby, but no one minded. Overall, I think the mixed atmosphere of a bar and caf\u00e9 with weekly special events certainly make this an exciting communal space for singles, bilinguals, and intellectuals alike. A great place to bring out of town guests and groups. The only complaint I have is that once I leave this seat right now, I will never find another one for the rest of the night. Not the most conducive to quiet studying but certainly four stars for a unique concept that will continue to draw a nice crowd. \u00a0I will definitely be back and maybe one of these days I will even shut down my laptop to catch a free screening with those that are here.",

Where the chairs are turned towards the sidewalk. Where you can hear two or three languages being spoken around you. Where everything is red and cozy and saturated in colors. Where the cheese is melted into the bread so nicely. Where accordions and bass fiddles are more common than a thoughtlessly plugged in radio.  Maybe I'm a sucker for this place because I AM European. I personally find it a gem of a coffee shop and the entertainment is always pleasant. Sandwiches aren't bad either, although I wish they'd have different teas.",

After looking up 'live music' in the Mission on Yelp, Revolution Cafe seemed to be the best choice! And it was! :-)  Revolution Cafe is a quirky mix of a bar and coffee shop in the middle of the Mission. When we arrived we got a little table with two chairs at the patio and \u00a0later found out they were VIP seats. Thats' right! People were eyeing our seats, which made our experience even better!  They had sangria on the menu, but they ran out of it, so we drank mimosas instead. The band was just starting, and it was a nice mix of blue-grass and jazz. The crowd was very eclectic - old lady with dog, international couples, a group having a philosophical discussion about Heidegger, \u00a0and quite a few people preparing and lighting up a joint as it's nobody's business. Everybody seemed so free and so present that made me wonder why I don't hang out in the Mission more.  After a couple of mimosas, some people watching and lots of laughs, it was time to come back to a different world. But now I know that Revolution Cafe is there whenever I feel like having a little revolution on my day! :-)",

Now that I moved back to SF I finally tracked it down.\n  Anyway, one of the coolest cafes in SF with large front windows that pull completely back making the cafe spill out onto the sidewalk. Feels more like a cafe in New Orleans, LES New York or Havana than SF - it's got that cool indoor-outdoor, rundown old world feel.\n  Any Yelpers know where that beautiful bar comes from - looks like it was salvaged from some grand old saloon?\n  Oh, and bonus stars for being open so late - you never feel like you have to rush to or from this place. Bonus stars for the free wireless. And bonus stars for Sunday night, when they (apparently) push all the tables back and give free tango lessons and an \"Argentine Tango Social Dance\". This one is a classic.",

And this is the kind of place that really encourages it, so you won't feel awkward doing a little staring here and there or being the subject of somebody else's staring. \u00a0In fact, you kind of forget that it's happening. \u00a0Number two, the atmosphere is very artsy, relaxed, peaceful, but there seems to always be something going on that makes it worth being there. \u00a0Number three, it draws a diverse, interesting, and genuinely friendly crowd, which to me is a big deal since I really can't stand cafes that pretend to be all independent anti-corporate establishments, but you know as well as anyone else there that its really just a facade that is used to get people inside (Canvas Cafe R.I.P.).  I can't really comment on the food or drink, but they do have a very extensive menu. \u00a0I did try a small cup of tomato soup which was very tasty but it was already room temp. when it was served to me which was a little disappointing since it was such a cold night. \u00a0Also, with the front part of the cafe being completely outdoors, you should make sure to dress warmly when going here.   To conclude, I would definitely go back to this place...its a very cool spot to hang out after work with some friends and have a few drinks and fun conversation.",

I loved this place and I hate to post it on Yelp but I really think their kitchen must be disgusting for this to happen, if you've been there then you know the place is not he cleanest place but I though oh well..the city has a great and strict health program and it must be clean...yes, I need to do more research.

There's people from different backgrounds and parts of the world hanging out there, which makes this the kind of place where anything goes and anyone is welcome. Maybe \"weird\" goes, but \"normal\" goes too, and everything in between including us people that could give a crap for either definition.

I was caught by surprise when I stopped there for a glass of wine on a Monday evening and I've been going back as often as I can since, as some of the movies can be pretty good - and free to watch.

Always a woman in a black hat wearing black dress and dark glasses, I sometimes grabbed a vegetable panini, other times I stuck with a glass of red. Whenever I stepped into the place, it made me feel like I was at a local bar found in the Latin Quarter, 5th arrondissement, my favorite district in Paris, until I was in Stockholm last year, where I went inside of Jazzpuben Stampen. The EC reminded me a smaller version of Stampen (if you can imagine an even smaller venue than Stampen). Stampen is located in the old town, where among the jazz luminaries posters on the wall, was an odd duckling of Woody Allen photo, who also played there. No Woody Allen on site at the RC. A famous San Francisco Jazz musician aka Harvard 89 alumni Anton Schwartz, whom I had seen performing with the Boston Pops in May during Harvard 89's 25th Harvard reunion, had indeed played there, once, or twice, so I was told, by someone who used to date him in college.   I always tell people to meet me there because it felt, despite its San Franciscaness, very out of place. For a while, the wine only costed $5, now $7.5, still affordable, though sandwiches remained at $5 a pop. It's way classier than the Make Out Room, across the street.   I can tell you which nights to show up to chill: Mondays, Tuesdays and Sundays. Don't go on Friday because some of the more popular bands are playing and you'd have no seats in a warm summer night. Though a friend of mine's band was really good and I once organized a gathering there to watch his band performing, but I quickly realized that when they played, everyone danced, on the sidewalk and street. It was a lovely summer evening. You would not need a seat, no one sat down that night.  On those quieter days I listened to classical music and read my book, and on occasion I would chat with friends. It's not exactly a pick up joint, and it's not a date place. For that, I'm grateful.",

Nothing particularly interesting grabbed me about it, so haven't been back. However, last night we were walking home and heard the tropical island sound of a siren and a ukulele. We HAD to check it out, and refresh ourselves with another cocktail. Inside were 3 beautiful girls...Paper Dolls, check them out! Singing songs from the 80s to the present along with some originals. At one point one of the songstresses removed her skirt baring cute black short shorts and a rather lovely rear end. The place was packed with sundry folks, not just hipsters, as many reviews mention. I'm not sure I'll be back, but if they have more fascinating acts like that, I sure will try!",

If the revolution involves lounging in a prime people watching spot in the Mission, sitting on the sidewalk and drinking Chimay on tap while the sun shines down upon you, then sign me up! I'm so there.  The Revolution cafe may not be fomenting dissent (other than your garden variety Mission-ite angst and disapproval) but it is a great place to hang out. You will need to dust off your table sharking skills and have an appreciation for, or at least a tolerance of, an eclectic variety of music . Don't expect the bartender to be social, that's not what he's there for. He's there to serve coffee, beer, wine, sometimes eats. They have Chimay on tap (did I mention that already?), a good wine selection, decent prices and generous pours.   Viva la revolution!",

Downside: During my five minutes in there, I couldn't avoid the overwhelming scent of B.O. I even checked myself - it wasn't me. And while I know, the scent of a hard working body is normal, it was just a little worrisome that the scnet was SO strong when the doors and windows were open...............  Needless to say, I'd go back for the free wifi and to taste the coffee, but only if it's nice out so I can sit outside in the \"fresh\" air.",

On top of that, most of the beers on tap were \"out\", wtf?? The waitstaff seemed overworked and confused, and got snappy at my friends while they were ordering. And there were some people hanging out working on their laptops with headphones on at 6:30 pm on a friday as most of the bar/cafe was clearly in party mode... just seemed odd. That said, the vibe was pretty good and the live music seemed like it would have been cool.  I can't decide if I will return here. It has potential, but the waitstaff need to work on their speed/attitude and the bar needs to be better stocked (managerial shittiness could be to blame for this, too).",

Music is always playing loudly and if you're lucky you'll catch one of the live bands that frequent this spot. After 3pm people are allowed to smoke on the patio, so sometimes the scent of cigarettes wafts in. On the plus side, they're pretty laid back about mary jane, a big plus in my opinion. Due to this, some seedy characters hang around the front of the cafe. Once, a drunk man seat-jacked me when I got up to grab something. I pointed to my laptop on the table and asked him to leave, but he refused and started spilling coffee all over. There was nowehere else to sit, so I had to pack up my things and go home, sadly.

Call your order in 30 minutes ahead of time, pick up your ham and cheese, and get out as quickly as possible to get the most possible enjoyment out of this establishment!",

However, there is still something appealing about this place. I love that the front opens up to the sidewalk, and all kinds of people from all over the world seem to gather here. I think the main draw to this place isn't the food or wine/beer, it's more the scene. It's really entertaining to sit and have a glass of wine and watch people. There are crazies, artists, musicians, drop-outs, and I dare say a revolutionary or two. Wine and beer are affordable and it's a good spot to sit while you wait for a table at Lolo.",

A spot opened up for us just as we arrived (it was fate!), we ordered a cheap liter of delicious Sangria, and had just enough time to chat and people watch outside before the band started playing. It was great!   The place feels tiny once the band gets going, but as more people pack in, it starts to feel cozy. You make friends with your neighbors (as per usual in California).

The Mission was buzzing, and everyone was looking for a nice spacious patio where they could drink their beer under a starry sky.   Of course, nights like these mean Zeitgeist has a line out the door before 10pm. So where's a good-natured young lad to go to enjoy the weather and his suds? The answer lies on 22nd St., at Revolution Cafe.   Inexplicably, I'd never been to the 22nd St. corridor. Makeout Room, Latin American Club, these places had eluded me. But on that Friday evening, I discovered the majesty of Revolution: its throngs spilling out onto the sidewalk, drinks in hand; the air heightened with conversation; the piano trilling behind it all. I've never imbided in Paris, but I imagine this is the kind of casual elegance one finds there.   Somehow, Revolution has cultivated its popularity without becoming a scene -- that's more than I can say for Zeitgeist, unfortunately. And that's why I will return to this establishment again and again.",

You got the quirky artwork on the walls, the eclectic staff, the bar-cafe fusion (decent beers -- leffe, chimay, etc), the daily independent musicians that entertain you from day til night. The diverse crowd may be my favorite -- dads taking their kids out for the day, the regulars blazing on the patio (and by regulars I mean, by my own labeling, the vietnam vet, the dreadlock boys, the rasta man, the knitting girl, etc), the teens scoping out the music, the old men reading their book/papers, and me, never really bored there. It's not the type of spot you come to have an amazing cup of coffee or a fantastic sandwich.

Rhythm furnace. Hot, baked interlude of daylight simmering into night. I love black polka dots. The most beautiful eyes watch a bow go back and forth. Cat eyes. Mysterious eyes. Bedroom eyes. Shoulders smaller than forearms in her hand a flute. It turns out those eyes are leaving. Phone light in her face. The one with a bun in her hair plays the piano. Black dress; single shoulder straps barely an inch, then the lights descend. She motions a violinist into a space between tables. The voice whose sound I cannot recognize yet does a melodic test. Amid the chaos of back music, now guitar strums. Bun drops, the voice fills the air. My heart sinks, tears well at the beatific night. A man's voice; it's high, enchanting like a woman's call, androgynous. Strings, the pianist plays moving her bangs. \"Night and day, I need you here.\" Melodic, majestic, \"Watching and whatnot,\" he says. \"Romeo and Juliet,\" the violin of yesteryear. High walls of orchestrated eloquence, telling a story of love, like Spencer Day. One voice organizes the others, a series of black outfits, strumming, blowing, dragging a bow; a voice fills the air, foot on a drum. Chorus. Tempered by the violin, acapella intro.   \"Nearby caf\u00e9, Listen closely and you'll hear the sound of breaking hearts.\" Family Crest. Aqualung, Dead Can Dance. Haunting ghoulish minstrels 31 shows in 31 nights, like gypsies for money, a xylophone. \"I'll move through the night, I'll sleep when I am dead...\" Irish River Dance. \"Bells are Ringing Over the City.\" Storytellers dreaming otherworldly images.  Part II  Beethoven Violin Quartet #1 (I guess) From no sound to a particular sound, how once there is nothing, then a Beethoven I never would have guessed. She took off her glasses, elevator glances at the thin violinist, who can't see her in his arcing. \"MJ179\" is the violinist's name. (Small light brown curls, leather jacket, plaid shirt.)  The complexity of the pieces is daunting, from memory-like typing where hand and eye coordination must fly, and where for me it would be problematic, never sure, perhaps by intuition looking at the letter forms. Schumann Piano Quintet. Yoshi's in October. Repeating the piano as a silhouette. They come in and out of prominence, as strings then as piano (also strings) the music translates to my own joy. I feel like I can play or at least have memory. These are like mist clouds over a green hill. I wonder if other animals respond in kind. When something doesn't go right, we seem to notice, like the last page of a piece. But what we do with empty space is up to us.  Mendelssohn Violin II Quartet Opus 13 (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4hlvZKPN17U&amp;s=58cf399539cb6fb1c798e7f8fd84f951ef7c4a5b9e9fa4d65cda675f0faa493c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/watch?v=4hlv\u2026</a>) Interlocking in space. Each member playing his part. A flutter, seriousness, a graceful courtesy. A tender eyeing of the tenorous man, the bejeweled woman, a commotion of simultaneous notes, a conversation among strangers. I can't quite place the sound, whether a clothesline on a New England Beach in winter or feelings themselves. Is this water falling in a sink as the wife of a cheating man washes the dishes? Is this the sun rising on her empty bed? I hear the door opening. The woman's dog is feeling her sorrow. Her children are fast asleep. \"Ellis and Gough... Classical Revolution CD.\" Much sadder and slower, this time the husband is home. Everything festers, where one seems free; the other is locked in the righteousness of commitment. They fight despite that flowers are given, yellow ones in the morning light, with the envy of innocence. The pure one wishes it could be less true. In fear, she surmises her hurt. He takes a shower. She hears the soap drop. Then the whole body seems to crash. A loss of consciousness comes over him. She weeps seeing her entre vous. She opens the door quickly and comes to his aid. He barely notices her, still in the water. He is quiet. He is alone, distant to himself under the auspices of time and memory. Philip Roth: American Pastoral, The Human Stain, The Plot Against America (Continuum Studies Contemporary N American Fiction), late Beethoven Quartet no.13 op.130, cavatina (5/8), best love music he ever wrote. Somehow she manages to forgive him and life seems to go back to normal. The dog's chain rattles as it sits on the floor. I wonder what it is feeling? Are these notes too sharp for its ears? Is it pleased? Still, a mood, walking home alone in the alley, between two streets, these haunting melodies come to the man. She has long ago left him. He is alone. All progress is over. Time has come. There is this tender moment he sees as he looks out the window and potential lovers are chatting.",

I don't drink so a lot of times I end up drinking a few club sodas and getting bored while by friends get drunk; or it's so crowded and loud, I can't enjoy the music. This place was perfect--I could have a great latte while my friends ordered Sangrias.   The latte was very good and not expensive. My friends complained that the Sangrias were more like grape juice and didn't have a lot of alcohol, but they didn't mind too much since the prices are pretty low.   My friends and I arrived at 9 pm on a Friday night and the place was almost full, but we were able to snag a table outside on the patio...right near the glass doors into the cafe. We saw the band come in around 9:15/9:30 and they started the performance near 10 pm. They played mostly Latin and Spanish music...it was very lively and sounded amazing. The place inside was super packed and very hot so we were happy to be outside and able to hear the music just fine. I could see some people dancing inside and enjoying themselves, even thought there isn't really a dance floor.   The only downside of sitting outside is that smell of cigarettes and pot. If you mind those two things then I would suggest you sit inside. I thought it was a great experience and very SF--hippies, hipsters, and bums all converging in one area. Also, CASH ONLY (bummer).",

A friend of mine lives directly above this cafe, &amp; I met up with him for an afternoon drink last Saturday during Burning Man, when the city felt a step slower, a bit less crowded. We sat around for a few hours sipping coffee &amp; beer &amp; talking to some of the extremely friendly patrons. Music drifted through the place like a hazy plume of exhaled cigar smoke. Life was good.  This little block at this particular moment was fast making me re-realize the charms the Mission holds. The charms that had been lost between countless weekend nights spent barhopping &amp; in that 15 minute wait to pee in the Delores Park bathroom on an insanely crowded warm sunny Sunday.  It's got everything a Mission community coffee shop SHOULD have: Good coffee, good sandwiches, sangria, beer, a spacious, airy &amp; somewhat mysterious atmosphere. A living breathing consciousness that you just can't pin down.  The friend of another good friend from back East moved into town recently &amp; got a place just a few blocks from the Revolution. He wanted to meet up &amp; needed suggestions. Big surprise, I told him about this place &amp; after a few hours drinking coffee &amp; beer there yet again yesterday, I think I've got another convert.  The Revoution has already started.",

So, it's around 80 degrees outside (scorching for SF!) and after walking from Puerto Alegre to the Sketcher's outlet we needed something to quench our thirst and please the palate. So we stop and decide to try out TRC. I've walked past this place many a time, each time getting a look from the patron's seated in front of this place that said to me, \"Look at us! We're so smart, hip and beautiful.\"   So as we walk back to our cars from the Sketcher's Outlet and lugging our bags of slip-ons, and lace-up open-toe platforms (Okay, so Jen is gorgeous and bought these hot shoes which made her look even hotter! - ZIZZLEzzzzz! - I just had to get that in Jen! Anyway, marvelous simply marvelous! Oh lord, I felt so feminine saying that - fanning my self Ala Carl Lagerfeld)  Oh, so back to TRC, it was cool inside, lot's color and lot's of characters. It was like Smurfville meets, Gotham City! Robin Hood vs. Pinocchio. Never seen so many fedora's worn by 20 somethings in one place. Oh. yeah back to earth. We both ordered Italian sodas. Jen had Cherry and I ordered Mango/Banana. I've never seen so little sparkling soda mixed in with a bottle of syrup! I guess this is good. Anyway, the sodas were okay but the weather was so nice outside that I will give this place an extra star just because it was a part of my fabulous afternoon!  Why did I write this review? \u00a0Such a waste! Here, I'll give you a refund. Here you go, you just got the last 5 minutes (slow reader huh!) of your life back.

Plus, the people are all very friendly, and laid back; its has a very genuine local Mission SF feel and hang out. I bring my guests from out of town so they can experience the culture here.   And the guy who was a little mean to some folks in the past is much nicer now (and to clarify he would only snap at folks who were in need of correction---now he does it professionally. The girl they had working there who recently left was also always super nice.   Lastly, the smokers now (obviously informed) are more considerate and do step out to the sidewalk mostly to smoke cigarettes so it no longer is a problem for those who want to to avoid breathing in smoke, inside.   ------------------------  Updated: They have a new person working there, and she is very nice. In fact all the people working here are quite nice. Also, the smoking problem apparently has been fixed. Rarely do I smell smoke from cigarettes (I actually like 420), coming in anymore. They seem to now enforce that, which is great. So changing this to a 4 stars. I would give it 5 except its so popular its hard to find a seat. :)  -----  I love it here because of the free music, including classical every Monday. The guy that works there can be a little rude, though, but that doesn't really bother me. What does bother me is all the smoke. Lots of smokers right outside in the patio (which seems like smoking is allowed there?), and all that smoke doesn't know to stay outside with the windows all open and the door open; the wind brings it right indoors. I thought SF had some strict smoking laws? If so they should really be enforced. My gf who I brought here to enjoy the music doesn't want to come back because she can't stand the smoke which was particularly strong that evening.

It certainly feels busy all the time, but not over crowded (although it may take you some time to grab a seat or two) but that just gives you an excuse to bump into someone and start a conversation.  The music varies, much like the people. Music can be loud and in your face or chilled back, much like the people. The atmosphere is always cool and it's always fun to just sit back and watch it all unfold. The beer is good and flowing, the coffee is decent. They have some food, but not spectacular. It's good to snack on while drinking your Chimay. You can bring your laptop or a book, or just bring yourself. \u00a0The only bummer is that there's one bathroom, but that's quickly overlooked by the indescribable coolness of the place.

You wanna make a friend, meet some strangers, share with a foreigner, talk to someone in a different language - this is your spot.   I see some negative reviews about the staff - definitely take those with a grain of salt. The staff is pretty rad. Yeah, if you don't buy something, they'll get upset, but who goes to a bar and doesn't buy nothing? That's just loitering.

Lots of people are outside smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, and loving it.   Some other day around 1pm Sunday, ordered two delicious mighty leaf teas, luckily got a table, yet extremely close to everyone around us, listened to very loud jazz music that was pretty awesome and still could sort of have a conversation.  Another day at the cafe, 3pm Monday, barely any people, got a great seat, ordered a delicious chai latte, read and people watched until 5pm. Later on that day, started to get full of people having beers and funky conversations.  Last day so far at 10am Friday, cup of coffee, the newspaper, outside under the heat lamps working on my laptop and feeling welcomed by the neighbors.

They've got tons of beer and drinks including wine and sangria. You can buy the sangria in a pitcher form which is pretty perfect for a bunch of friends. They host music events regularly and for a small place it fits in just right. The alcohol they sell for cheaper on week nights by like 2$ which kicks ass. There's tons of little tables and chairs and benches and couches everywhere and you can group up with a bunch of people and just chat the night away with ease. They have indoor and outdoor seating and there's people going in and out all the time or just hanging round out front chatting. Smokers def dig this place. I'm not sure what's the deal with the name. Kinda not alot connecting it with the atmosphere, but w/e I guess. Every place has got to have some kinda hook in their name I guess. There's a piano against the wall when you come in which they use for performances. I'd be surprised if you couldn't play it regularly though too.  They make food here as well which I didn't get to try, but I have a feeling is prob pretty good. This place almost feels like a really mellow bar when you're there at night which is kinda it's main appeal. You get kinda a smarter less rowdy crowd but all the good drinks and fun friendly atmosphere you could ask for. The bathroom in the back is also pretty clean too. All red walls and a couple locks for the person who is just too paranoid about someone walking in on them. Oh I should mention there's just one bathroom, no guys vs girls here.  It's a cash only place which is the only annoyance for me, but like anyone they keep an ATM next to the bar for easy access. I believe the charge is $2.85. Damn you Mission!",

Whether you are sipping on some iceless, fruitless sangria, having a Chimay or drinking cheap beer, there is a thin magic layer that turns anything normal into a dream at The Revolution Caf\u00e9. \u00a0  It doesn't matter if you sit outside and have to put your drinks on the floor behind you, so \"technically\" you won't \u00a0be drinking on the sidewalk. \u00a0It doesn't matter if those by passers click their tongue in despair because there's no seating available (I would say not even standing available), and have to go somewhere else. \u00a0It doesn't matter if you get asked for money by a couple of hopeless men, or the melodious jazz duo stops playing for a while and you're still on the mood to snap your fingers. \u00a0You'll still breathe in air that feels like crushed planets dust, that smell like leaves, cocktails and wood, and the different aromas coming out of the many bodies lingering at The Revolution Caf\u00e9.  I wish I'd had a place like this closer. \u00a0It would be part of my life. \u00a0There is nothing as feeling like you were made by lines of character development and exquisite plots. \u00a0Here, I was the \"girl visiting from Seattle\" but still a regular shook my hand, and asked me for Kurt Cobain and the incessant rain, while checking if my left elbow was working well.  Only in Mission. \u00a0I'm bringing back to Seattle my own ISBN number, courtesy of The Revolution Caf\u00e9.  \u00a1Gracias!",

You get it. It should be called The Library Cafe or Enjoy The Silence Cafe. \u00a0  The Revolution Cafe is absolutely NOT good for one thing. And that one thing is a pack of drunk post-brunch Yelpers, rolling 15 deep, on a QUIET, sunny Saturday afternoon. Who are these people at The Revolution Cafe? How is it they appear to be both sober AND well-rested at 2 p.m. on a Saturday? Why are they glaring at us and why is steam coming out of their ears?  OK! My Bad! I had only been to The Revolution Cafe for live music at night before and I was probably already drunk everytime I showed up there. I also remembered them having some killer sangria and being a lot cheaper than Medjool. I wouldn't know now. Our plans came to a screeching halt once we set foot in TRC and realized that 15 of these things were not like the others. Something about \"Revolution\" makes me think loud and rowdy. I couldn't have been more wrong. So like any good mother hen, I rounded up my naughty chicks, took a head count, and herded them back to Medjool. Where our kind is always welcomed with full Stellas and a hefty bar bill.   The Revolution Cafe has lots of outdoor seating, beers on tap, a wine selection, and great sangria. Someday when I get my act together and learn how to read, I'll QUIETLY sit outside, sip my coffee, and read the paper. Until then, you can find me on the roof at Medjool, slumped over a chair, yelling about something or other.",

You can sit and smoke and drink on the sundrenched front patio if you're lucky enough to snag a seat (full at 2:30pm on a Monday).   Being as I'm an alcoholic instead of a caffeine addict, this cafe only gets three stars, as every adult beverage on the menu should have been at least $1 cheaper &amp; the bathroom stank.   From the other reviews, it sounds like this is a spot to check out more in the evening for live music and the like.

Having changed owners recently (the Emmy's Spaghetti/Blue Jay people I hear), the Revolution has greatly improved over its earlier incarnation. Whereas the old had a rep for booking lots of boring farty MOR singer-songwriters, jazzy stuff predominates now and is way better. Their food of old was no treat either, and is vastly improved, though culling other reviews here will show that you can still wait forever for it to come and your server may find you a dire pest, probably based solely on how their day has been going.  Where they haven't raised the bar is in their coffee cups. A bit of an improvement as the coffee here used to frequently be apalling and is now upgraded to Bog Standard.  Where the magic happens here is when the weather is nice, the music doesn't suck, you can find a table and the old hippie is bugging somebody else, because you can drink your beer or sangria in the out-of-doors. So when the revolution begins in earnest, let them know us by our Adidas flip-flops!",

Many a time at Revolution I have enjoyed a coffee, beer, or snack while listening to good music and watching the city of SF pass me by...all the while thinking, \"This place is great for being a part of making all this happen.\"",

    "review_text": "Lovely place to chill on a sunny Sunday with a novel and cup of coffee. \u00a0At night, it has a more bar-ish atmosphere (they have live jazz and serve wine, beer, and sake drinks). \u00a0Revolution has unfailingly cool local art, Mission folks with revolutionary proclivities (last time I was there, a Globalize SF meeting was being held), and good music. \u00a0The live music in the evenings seals the deal.  Revolution Cafe also has pretty good panini and snacks and is right near Make-Out Room and Latin American Club. \u00a0True, the coffee is not as good as Ritual's, but you can sit outside, enjoy the sun, and NOT wait in line for 45 minutes here.  One time I was here, the DJ tried to stab someone who complained about the music he was playing. \u00a0The cops came afterwards and he bolted, ran down the street to hide in an alley, and left his DJ equipment. \u00a0There's no point to this story, except that it was weird. \u00a0And maybe a testament to Revolution Cafe bc it didn't stop me from coming back.",

    "review_text": "I go here once a week to get coffee before my Thursday night class on the CCSF Mission campus. I must say, I have gotten about the same results every time.  1. The staff is almost always beyond rude. I stand there and watch as the guys behind the counter just sit there and talk to their friends, will glance over and stare at me, and then go back to talking to their friends. I'm so sorry that I've meddled with your much important conversation about who puked at last night's party after doing JaggerBombs. Though, when the girls are working behind the counter, they're usually super sweet and nice. 2. When you run out of brown sugar or half-and-half, and I ask for more, I usually get the most disgusted look in the world. I'm sorry, did you think I said, \"Would you mind killing your entire family and serving their heads on pikes for me please?\" because that's the disgusting look you usually give me. Last time I was there, the guy made this big \"to-do\" about getting more sugar for me. And kept sighing and huffing, as if he was growing and harvesting the sugar for me. Get over it ya stupid emo. 3. The line for the bathroom is right near the milk and sugar, so it gets stupid crowded here, which means there's lots of crowded-ness and people complaining. Hmm...  The only reason that there is not a one-star review, from all my bitching, is that the two girls that work here sometimes are really sweet and always nice to me (the exception to points one and two from above). And, I've learned where they keep the half-and-half in the fridge next to the bathroom, so since I was given permission once to get it, I now do it all the time.  Also, they get an extra star because they always have pretty sweet artwork in here. That makes waiting in line (which is usually about 10 minutes or more for a cup of coffee) a little bearable.",

I tried to get coffee here once, but the espresso machine was on the fritz, so I can't comment on that. Never tried the food. Great 10-midnight happy hour (not sure if it is still on, last time I went was several months ago), can't beat that.",

There is always live music, or a dj spinning house music. The staff is friendly and pleasant. You can sit on the porch and drink with a smoke. There is consistently beautiful art on the walls. I take all of my out of town friends to the Revolution Cafe as part of my SF tour. The people who come and go are always beautiful. I cannot think of a better spot to sit and relax and watch the city walk by.",

We actually got a good table on the opposite side of where the piano is. Is that weed I smell floating inside? Um... where was I? Oh! So I got a spicy chicken sandwich and a Chimay. I love how the \"fill to here\" line on the special Chimay glass is totally ignored and is filled to the rim. I followed that with a Leffe. Great music tonight, too.  Verdict: Approved.",

The place is teeny, it's packed, and there's barely any place to sit or move (the bow of the violinist was almost in my face!) but it's a cozy amicable environment. The sandwiches are also very tasty and the bartender friendly (if a little bit rushed as a one-man show in a packed house).   A little gem that's worth swinging by!",
