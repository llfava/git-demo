    "review_text": "First of all, the new Exploratorium looks great and gives a fresher experience to those of us who've been visiting the old facility multiple times since childhood, despite most exhibits being the same. And as another reviewer mentioned, this place would really benefit from more signs so it's easier to navigate around. My bf and I visited After Dark, so it was great not having to fight with little kids that either don't share or cut in line. However, that also means you have to fight with a bunch of drunk young adults that just won't leave certain stations. Overall, the drunk adults cancel out the inconsiderate kids, so your overall advantage to visiting After Dark is the opportunity to walk around with booze and to pay less for general admission. They also have special events such as concerts, so some Thursdays may be busier than others. While I had a lot of fun visiting a lot of stations, there were a lot of adults that burned most of their time waiting in line to get booze. If you're planning to eat at the restaurant there, be prepared to wait in a long line and then spend more time trying to find a table to sit at. The chicken there was quite tasty and way better priced than anything else you'd find along the Pier, so it's definitely worth a try if you're hungry.",

The lines were long but that's to be expected when a museum first opens...   Pros: The outdoor space is lovely and my kiddo enjoyed crawling around the gyroid structure at the entrance.  The staff - as always - were really helpful and friendly.  The restaurant food was absolutely delicious and we enjoyed being able to eat outside right on the water. We had the pizza, fruit salad, milk (and a cookie for the little one). The price wasn't as bad as I thought it would be - around $16 for all of it, and the server even served up extra banana slices for us when my son mentioned he loved them. Hands on. This is truly a hands on museum. Nothing holds a toddler's attention for long but this place comes close!  Cons: I was a little surprised that many of the exhibits were the same ones from the old location - though there were a lot of new ones too.  The restaurant trays weren't big enough to fit two plates. $25 tickets - yikes. Glad they have free days here. Limited/bad signage. The first thing I noticed walking in was the arrow on the \"enter here\" sign was tiny. People with tickets were waiting in the really long \"to purchase\" line because we were unsure where to go. Inside, it was hard to track down bathrooms and there were little to no signs letting us know where to find food. It's shocking how many parents are oblivious to the lines forming behind their children playing with one of the exhibits. What ever happened to the taking turns rule? (This is really a parent-related complaint though I wonder if having more staffers at the popular exhibits moving people along would help each kid feel like they have a turn.)  Can't wait to try the place out again on a day that isn't so crowded!",

It's even more awesome that they have After Dark every first Thursday of the month -- $15, 18+ only, and alcohol is served all night.

The inside kid in me wanted to go crazy reading and playing with all the gadgets but there was so much that I didn't even know where to start! A lot of the exhibits were just a refresh of the things that we've all been taught in grade school .. Explanations of optical illusions, how our eyeballs work, and color play just to name a few. There were also experiments to engage in with a partner such as a lie detector and a \"gut instinct\" test, as well as talking to each other from across the room (pretty darn amazing!) I must be getting old because a lot of the exhibits gave me a headache with all the lights flashing in my face and the spinning boards. I can see that this is truly a place that's catered to little ones. Adults.. Ehh.. Not so much.  We opted for the foods at the food court and I have to say that it is absolutely not worth it at all. Overpriced with sub-par quality foods as well as small portions. We had the macaroni and it was watery and almost flavorless. The other dish was a cheese enchilada and nachos that were of microwave quality. Skip out on this.  The theme for the night we went was \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" and they were offering haircuts as well as held a huge game tournament. I had fun for the most part and I enjoyed my time there but I wouldn't see the need to go a second time. We were able to run through everything at least once and we left pretty satisfied.",

Exploratorium didn't seem to worry much about capacity but it was too crowded to actually try many of the exhibits, old or new. There were just too many people and the lines were very long. A lot of the special booths ran out of food samples before the lines finished. It doesn't seem like an easy place to start random conversations or meet people either. People are already in groups or on dates and are preoccupied with the exhibits.  I do have to give the Exploratorium some credit for giving a student discount, even Cal Academy doesn't do that in the evenings. Some of the old exhibits are just as fun as I remembered when I was a kid. I saw some ad about them relocating to another space- I hope they don't get pushed out. This is a classic.  The one take home lesson that you can actually do (since most of us don't have easy access to liquid nitrogen, etc) is wine + blender = hyperdecantation (decanted faster and tastier!) Give it a blind taste test and determine if the 5 volume cookbook set stands up to the test.",

It's all the fun of the Exploratorium (science presented in fun and often amusing ways), except at NIGHT, with ADULTS your age and oh, did I mention the full bar? Hands down my favorite exhibit is the Shadow Box in the far corner of the venue--try it out and you'll see why!  After Dark runs from 6-10 p.m. and costs $15 for gen admission, $12 for students with ID (drinks sold separately). They also have cool workshops that change every month (but you have to get there early to sign up for a good slot!).",

All the exhibits opened up after only a few minutes, and I was able to see almost the entire building in around two hours. This is not a place to rush through, though! Grab a cocktail, find a place to hang out, and either enjoy the beautiful view of the Bay Bridge (and the bay itself) visible from the back of the Exploratorium, or enjoy the exhibits throughout.  I wouldn't have dinner here, because the food is a little overpriced and not that great, but it's the Exploratorium, not a restaurant!

The one I attended had a petting zoo with snakes and crocodiles, and they brought along a wild cat and tanks full of creepy crawlies - exactly what you need to appeal to that inner child.  Best exhibit? I couldn't really say, whilst there was some gratification electrocuting strangers (by my explaining at one exhibit which generated an electrical current, that if I touched them this would increase their body mass and thus the affect of the current on them), and also playing drunken 4 way PacMan... Everything was pretty fun and I was impressed with all the great stuff they had.  One issue was the price, at $15 a ticket and then $9 a wine - it can get expensive - that said, it was totally worth the cost.

    "review_text": "The Exploratorium is the most compelling museum I've ever been to! The \"After Dark\" event is a must-attend for anyone who's even mildly interested in science, drinking, how interesting phenomena work, or all of the above.   Location/Atmosphere-5/5. First of all, I love the Embarcadero, and how unapologetic-ally tourist-friendly it is. The museum itself has an amazing layout. It's \u00a0modern and open, dimly lit to emphasize the exhibits, and easy to walk though. Every 15 inches or so there's an exhibit to look at, touch, and experience. I've gone twice to this event and haven't managed to see every exhibit. If you make it to the back of the museum, there's a trendy bar, SeaGlass Restaurant. The decision to have Exploratorium After Dark be adults-only is brilliant. Why go to a regular bar when you could go to a top-notch museum that effectively functions as a bar? The no-kids policy gives it a nice vibe, and makes it a \"safe space\" for grown-ups to walk around buzzedly and examine earthly marvels in wonder without having to worry about being impolite if you're blocking a 7 year old's view of the cloud chamber.   Exhibits-5/5. My favorite wing is the Living Systems gallery; I'm consistently blown away by live chicken embryos, touch-sensitive plants, algal mats, and giant logs. Upstairs there is a Landscape gallery that has a fog machine, cloud chamber, rift machine, \u00a0and even more..The cloud chamber was amazing; you can see alpha radiation from the decaying lead on the brass rod in the middle of the chamber. I also love the Central Gallery, with exhibits on diffraction and other light phenomena.   Food/Drink-3/5. The first time we went we had Mahi Mahi tacos and Papas Bravas to eat; they were very flavorful and delicious. The drinks were a great selection and reasonably priced, as well! The second time we went my friend and I actually both got ill from our food--vegan chili--which was unfortunate. We were both sick for a day after attending. This is the reason I'm giving 4 stars--I would go there again for sure, but I'm hesitant to order their food, now.   Overall: This event is my favorite that I've had the pleasure to attend so far in SF!",

Overall, I like After Dark because I don't have to fight children for the chance to play with the exhibits. The booze helps, too. (This is also what's great about the Cal Academy's NightLife, though that's 21+)  Sometimes there are maps, which help tremendously. I wish they'd offer those all the time, or post floor plans in each wing to orient visitors (I did see a couple signs with arrows, but not maps or at obvious junctions).   It seems there are two very different After Dark experiences:  -1st Thursdays of the month, which are heavily marketed, have partners presenting demos around a theme, and are pretty crowded, and: -other Thursdays, which are not themed and while still lively and have in-house demos, are not very crowded at all.   Pros: -no kids = no guilt for playing with the interactive exhibits.  -is 18+ (so I can bring my sub-21 coworkers) -live demos and friendly staff. One station was dissecting a cow eye last night! -enormous, so I can go multiple times and see new stuff/skip stuff I find less interesting but still feel I got my money's worth. It also seems they change some things out pretty regularly.  Cons: -group tickets aren't individually printed, so you have to arrive together or have someone with the ticket meet them at the door.  -food is pricey, without a ton of variety. Filling, though.  -hard to prioritize what you want to see without a map.  -enormous, so you won't be able to see everything in one evening/would get tired or overstimulated spending the entire 4 hours trying to do it all.",

But everything you loved about the old Exploratorium is still here! The toilet fountain, the hanging piano, the interactive playthings, and the great demos. We popped by for Sexplorations, and I was impressed with how cranially-focused and thought-provoking the entire arrangement turned out to be. They challenged and amazed the audience with a variety of tactile presentations that drew in capacity crowds, or let you play all over the multitude of exhibits (some of which I remember from visiting as a kid).   The new campus is way closer to the city, making it a lot more accessible for visitors and city-dwellers alike. My one gripe is that the new thinner design did lead to more choke points as crowds tried to worm their way through the museum. Beyond that, this is a great evening for you and your playful friends.

The first Thursday of every month, the Exporatorium holds a playground for the 18 and over. \u00a0The Exploratorium was pretty fun to begin with, but when they add alcohol it gets even better. \u00a0The festivities begin at 6:00 and end at 10:00.  Parking sucks. \u00a0They have a tiny lot out front that is immediately packed, regardless of how early you arrive. \u00a0They have a much larger lot that is a ways away from the entrance and is poorly lit. \u00a0I swear we almost hit someone before. \u00a0At the February event the lot was closed and we had to park across the street.  Each month showcases a different topic. \u00a0January was \"Chill\", focusing on the art of relaxing. \u00a0We got there a little late and didn't really get to participate in the featured events, but we still had fun walking around and playing with the stuff they had there. \u00a0There are a million photo opportunities there. \u00a0We spent a while right up front playing with the bubble wall and the water drop photospeed demo. \u00a0Everything is interactive.  February was \"Surrealism\". \u00a0If you dressed up as your favorite surrealist you got a discount. \u00a0There were quite a few people dressed up. \u00a0The biggest event that night was the Alice in Wonderland Tea Party and characters walking around. \u00a0It's fun, even when you're sober.  If you are planning on going to more than one event, I would suggest buying the annual pass. \u00a0To go to one event it costs $15. \u00a0The annual pass is only $30. \u00a0I've already gotten my money's worth by going to two events, and I still plan on going to more.  The gift shop has a bunch of fun stuff to play with, too. \u00a0If you have an annual pass you get a discount on any merch. \u00a0There isn't much to eat there. \u00a0They have a cafeteria, but the food is limited and looks like it's been sitting there for a while. \u00a0The specialty drinks are STRANGE.

I was intrigued at the Exploratorium version primarily because I don't have to sit on BART + Muni for a significant amount of time to be able to drink in a museum! It is a quick 10 minute walk from the Embarcadero BART station.   The idea of this museum is great--a hands-on approach to teaching people, primarily kids, science and how it works. I don't think that it works too well in a 21+ adults only type setting mainly because if you aren't at an exhibit or demonstration, you can't really be doing much else. Also since it is a kid's museum, there are lots of things that are meant for small people. Very awkward for the tall people and girls dressed in club heels. The big bar near the entrance has 2 bartenders--one who is cash only and one who takes credit. Not sure if it is like this every time but the long line went by very quickly. Mixed drinks/wine were $9, and specialty beers were $5. There were not really food options unless you eat at the pricey restaurant inside or the $13 sandwiches from a vendor in the outside area (at least Cal Academy has cheap food options as well as expensive). The highlight of the evening was views of SF, the Bridge, and East Bay from the second floor outdoor area. Also it was fun to watch people from above. The outside wharf area of the building has a sculpture that you can climb. Kudos to them for providing a ton of options for seating around the whole space if you aren't lucky enough to participate in the exhibits inside.  I probably will not go out of my way to come back here again like I do for Nightlife at Cal Academy or Off the Grid at Oakland Museum (tickets are $6!!!!!). Many other museums offer similar 21+ events and although this cost few bucks more, I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. I guess it costs more because its a bigger space with a ton of exhibits inside. Who knows. But... nice try.  Also it was sad to see the signs taped up all over the place that said \"This exhibit was created by someone who is about to be laid off.\"",

Getting there was a bit of an adventure as we missed our stop and thought we were going to take an inadvdertant trip across the GG Bridge. Luckily, the bus stopped at the toll plaza and we reversed directions.  It was a super low key event but still a lot of fun! It wasn't very crowded so we felt free to meander, spend time at exhibits we liked, and generally enjoy ourselves. Cocktails are expensive so we... brought our own, and that worked out swimmingly.

    "review_text": "I decided to start a new Yelp listing for the \"Exploratorium After Dark\" event because it's such a different experience from the regular daytime Exploratorium. Reviews of it in the regular Exploratorium section would just get lost, and very likely confuse parents who are looking for information about the hands-on science museum in preparation for taking their kiddies there. Parents: keep right on looking. This isn't for you.  No, Exploratorium After Dark is a totally different experience. It's more like the \"Matcha\" events that the Asian Art Museum hosts or the ArtPoint ones at the deYoung / Legion of Honor. Imagine the Exploratorium being open at night, with the vast majority of people being stylish couples and singles in their 20s through 40s (and only a handful of children in attendance), two full bars, good music (everything from old Bowie to the Decemberists) piped at a nice low level throughout, the conspicuous lack of the din of shrieking children, and \u00a0s p a c e \u00a0 t o \u00a0 s p a r e ! How unlike the Exploratorium is THAT?!  Instead of having to wait to use the more popular exhibits, there are no lines. Instead of being rattled by crowds of shouting pre-teens and their harried chaperons, you can stroll around with room to spare, with a glass of wine and a nice buzz. And as a bonus, the Tactile Dome (normally ridiculously overpriced at $20) is just $5, which is what it should always cost (but doesn't). Call me strange, but I somehow prefer crawling around in the dark with attractive adults after a couple of drinks, rather than with hyperactive 4th graders.  \"Exploratorium After Dark\" happens the first Thursday night of every month, from 6pm until 10pm. It's only open to members (or those who buy \"Exploratorium After Dark\" passes), and you must be at least 18. Beer is $5, wine is $6, and mixed cocktails are $7; a little pricey, but how else are you going to be able to drink while operating dangerous electromechanical machinery in a museum setting?  For stylish adult science geeks, \"Exploratorium After Dark\" is nirvana.",

This is a great place for a group of friends or a date. There's always something to talk about when walking around here.  Parking was easy. We arrived around 6:30 or so and found a spot a small walk away from the entrance. Maybe it fills up later in the evening as some people seem to have had difficulty finding it according to some of the past reviews.   I was there practically from open to close that evening and still felt like I didn't get to see it all. I'm excited to come back and do this again sometime.

I'd had the Exploratorium on my list of things to do since I moved to the Bay area and finding out about the late night events seemed like the perfect excuse to go.  I went with a meetup group and my boyfriend tagged along at the last minute. \u00a0It was a great experience on both fronts and I'd definitely suggest this as a date night or just friends' night out. \u00a0I loved getting the chance to explore the exhibits without any inhibitions that come with being a 'grown-up' and was so excited to see most all the other attendees took part as well. \u00a0There were so many instances of strangers working together to solve (or compete) in various exhibits as well as laughing together when things went not quite as expected. \u00a0  We got there around 6:30 and walked right in with our pre-purchased tickets (you can just show them on your phone even though they say print them out). \u00a0We stayed until closing, and I still feel like we didn't get through all the exhibits, so it definitely leaves more to explore if you'd like to go more than once.   The only negatives were that I wish the talks were a bit more regulated/varied and that there were better food options. \u00a0We hung out at the restaurant bar for a bit and chatted with a few people and no one seemed really impressed by the (rather expensive) food. \u00a0The night we went, there was a talk on fermentation that turned out to be really interesting, but there were tons of people there so it seemed rushed and disorganized. I almost wish they had some sort of limit on people for the talks. \u00a0Also, I haven't been really impressed with their upcoming line up on the talks, they seem to be filling in gaps with random things now that they're having the event weekly. \u00a0They don't really match up to the quality of the Cal Academy evening events. \u00a0But I think even without the talk everyone would have a good time so I suppose it's a minor quibble.

I could have purchased tickets in advance, but the website made that a somewhat lengthy looking process, and it didn't seem critical. \u00a0Also, there is a student discount at the door not available online ($12 instead of $15).  We started out at 4pm from the peninsula, and needed to eat dinner before going to the event. \u00a0Between traffic, parking for dinner, eating dinner, more traffic, and parking for the Exploratorium we got there a little after 8pm. \u00a0Hordes of people were leaving, and hordes were milling around inside. \u00a0We were met at the door by a smiling, but rather mean girl who was very pleased to give us a lecture on all the mistakes we had made by not coming earlier or buying tickets online in advance. \u00a0She said you should come back next week... \u00a0Well, I do not live in SF, spent $75 on a zipcar and two hours driving through traffic to get there, and brought an out of town guest who lives over 2000 miles away and will not be here \"next week\" when we are supposed to do everything right so we can be allowed in. \u00a0Very poor customer service!! \u00a0Also, as far as I can tell the next event is not next week but next *month*!  It turned out the store was not restricted entry, and we could go in there. \u00a0We could have also walked around the new building to check it out. \u00a0Neither of these activities were suggested by the Exploratorium employee, despite her lengthy lecture to us on how we did everything wrong. \u00a0A better approach would have been to say \"I'm really sorry I can't let any more people in tonight, please come back and visit us tomorrow. \u00a0Here's a brochure about next month's After Dark event. \u00a0You can still visit our store and take a walk around the building\" \u00a0Even better would be selling more tickets! \u00a0More tickets = more money for the Exploratorium, more happy people, and common sense. \u00a0After all, a lot of people were leaving, so there was no way the space was at maximum capacity.   Overall, this was a horrible experience. \u00a0This is a poorly run/managed event and the staff members are not at all well trained in empathy or customer service. \u00a0We were treated like naughty children, not like valued customers or welcome visitors. \u00a0  It might be a fun event if you jump through the website hoops, or skip dinner and show up at 5:30 to get in line for a ticket. \u00a0I'm not very eager to find out anymore though.  Note: \u00a0This is a very bad event to attend if you are easily stressed out, don't like massive crowds, or suffer from sensory overload issues. \u00a0As other reviewers have noted, parking is also a disaster ~ the \"official\" parking lot (~$5/hr) was closed and full and there aren't a lot of other options at any price.",

It's like a drunken trip down memory lane. The boy and I walked around outside and climbed one of the structures to drink a few brewskies before going in, because we'd heard the drinks are pricey and we're young lovers on a budget...good plan! once inside we decided to splurge and get the specialty cocktail which advertised a splash of absinthe.   Well, that was probably dumb, but we were drawn in by the enticing idea of having absinthe in a science museum. It was tasty, but it was very weak and tasted mostly like sprite and lemonade with a \"mist\" of absinthey licoricey taste on top. So yeah, I would recommend going with your staple mix drink, wine or beer to get the most for your money.  One thing I have to mention in the tactile dome. IT IS A MUST DO. I don't think I'm very easily freak-out-able, but the first few minutes of total visual deprivation were intense, heart pounding and TOTALLY AWESOME. Tip: wear socks, cuz you can't wear shoes.

The price is cheaper and there are slightly less people. Yelpers on here are complaining that $15 dollars is expensive for admission. I think it is cheap, you have to pay $18(student discount) and $25(adult) on regular days. Even compared to academy of science $24(adult regular hours); this is considered a bargain. I rather pay this than the same for a cover at a seedy club any day. Quit yer yappin.   The exploratorium is a great two story science museum, and all the exhibits open at the day time are also open at night. So you get the full experience being here. There are tables where you can buy alcohol, but I don't suggest it. The drinks, both bottled and cocktail, are very expensive $5-10 and aren't very good quality. I didn't see alot of people buying it. And just because they serve drinks, this is not the place to get sh*tfaced. People here are having good clean adult fun. I had alot of fun playing with all the displays and just hanging out with my buddies here. The crowd is mixed with all ethnicities and age range of 21-50. Most people were 20s and 30s though.   Aside from the great exhibits, you can go outside to the deck and have a great view of the ocean and bay bridge. Because the exploratorium is on the pier, you are right on top of the water. There is also an outdoor observation area on the second floor.   Once you are done here, you can try the great night life and restaurants within walking distance.",

Massive lines for everything, people bumping into you everywhere. No way you can explore the whole place fully while you're there because there's a line and a crowd for everything.   The Exploratorium itself is freaking awesome - After Dark is fun, but know what you are getting, more of a party than an experience.",

Overall this was a great way to see the museum and I definitely will be back!",

    "review_text": "Went to the Molecular Gastronomy event last month. \u00a0The place was dimly lit, (ok, it's always dimly lit) but this time it felt more adult. \u00a0This was likely due to the copious amounts of alcohol.  Parking in the neighborhood is awful. \u00a0Take. A. Cab. \u00a0Even if its going to be $30. \u00a0It is worth your sanity.  The lines were super long. After looking for parking for 60 minutes, I only stayed an hour. \u00a0This meant I only got to see one demonstration. \u00a0It was great! \u00a0I'm a Supertaster! \u00a0Yea! \u00a0That being said, all demonstrations should require the following: 1. Good Signage. \u00a0Oh heck, how about signage period? 2. \u00a0Some kind of audio system - the presenter should have a microphone. \u00a0 3. Any visual things - like monitors - should be where everyone can see them, not just the 4 people in front.  I'm not the only one who was frustrated. \u00a0There were plenty of people complaining about the event planning. \u00a0At the Academy of Sciences they hand out passes. \u00a0That way you can have some fun while you wait to see your show. \u00a0'Cause no one likes to stand in line all night. \u00a0Right?  PS: Don't go hungry, the food isn't great.",

    "review_text": "Such a fantastic date night or night out with friends. \u00a0Enjoy food and drinks while exploring the museum. \u00a0During After Dark, there are far fewer children and families, and it mostly attracts young professionals for happy hour after work. \u00a0  Drink prices are reasonable, about $9 for (bottom-shelf) cocktails. \u00a0  I'm a member of the Exploratorium, so my one complaint is that membership doesn't include After Dark :/ \u00a0We get a $5 discount, but I've only been to the Exploratorium once during the day - all my visits end up being during the one time that's not included. \u00a0I also don't like that there are other exhibits inside that have an extra charge. \u00a0But, $10 (or even full price at $15) is still a good deal for a full night of fun.  Note: Only happens the first Thursday of the month. \u00a0  Watch out for parking meters. \u00a0The meter maids are particularly aggressive during after dark.",

    "review_text": "Tons of fun and so much to experience. \u00a0I think I love the Exploratorium even more as an adult than I did as a kid, so I love the idea of \"adults only\" nights. \u00a0At After Dark I got a turn at each exhibit without having to feel bad about cutting in front of kids.  I loved having a glass of wine while tinkering with circuits. \u00a0And I appreciated \u00a0the many patio spaces where I could get some fresh air. \u00a0It gets pretty warm inside.  I was pleasantly surprised to find so many exhibits that I couldn't possibly see it all in one night. \u00a0This gives me a good reason to go back again. \u00a0You should visit too--it's a lot of fun and a great way to support this local gem as they're experiencing tough financial times.",

    "review_text": "The Exploratoirum throws a night life very similar to the Academy of Science. I think Academy of Science is every Thursday night, but Exploratorium is the first Thursday of each month, so put a reminder on your calendar if you are planning to go!   Hmm. I got there at 7, and it was kind of dead... but it started to pick up around 8! So if you want to play with some of the exhibits, I suggest getting there early so you can 1. get parking and 2. play with exhibits without people hustlin you to hurry up. Haha. But even if you come later, you still have time to play with the exhibits and find parking in the residential areas. SO no worries.  Alright if you aren't a Physics nerd like me, I think the exhibits are just fun to just play around with. It's interesting since I have no idea what the concept behind each one is. There are placards with information on why... but I just skimmed it. Haha. I'm there to have fun, not really learn. But if you're interesting behind the concepts of it, then read away!  So every After Dark is themed... I went to the heartworks one that happened last night, and it was fun. Hearts all over and you can make your very own secret encoded QR tag. I still don't know what it is, but its that square bar code thing. There are scavenger hunts and did I mention always a new activity to do at each After Dark. It's just nice to look around.   This is an 18+ event, and 21 to drink. So there are no kids hogging up the exhibits or running around the museum. Pretty nice if you ask me. I don't have to worry about walking into strollers or wait for kids to be done playing with an exhibit, since some can take forever! This is great for a date night or just a fun night out with friends! Check it out.  I'm not sure how much it is usually. But I had a google offer which was 2 tickets for 15... I think originally its 15 a person",

You won't have the major programs, but you'll get plenty of exhibit time.   At first I wasn't a fan of the new location b/c it seemed difficult to park and what not, but there's plenty of neighborhood parking in the evenings. Make sure you don't get stuck with a Port Authority meter (24 hour enforcement!).",

Nice vibe, lots of interactive science contraptions and experiments/shows. I'm from SoCal and enjoyed this much more than Griffith Observatory. The event was 4 hrs and I honestly think more time is needed to truly enjoy this type of neat event. I was planning to have a drink or two but refrained due to the long lines. Prices seemed high for small amounts of drinks. Otherwise, great atmosphere. Awesome for potential dates and groups of friends to just have a good time.",

    "review_text": "I have to say, I absolutely loved the idea of after-dark adult-oriented museum events. \u00a0But this particular event that I participated in was a bit of a disappointment. The title was \"Gastronomy,\" so of course it was jam-packed. Apparently, most of these events tend to be relatively quiet, but as soon as food is on display, it's a completely different story. I have to say, the crowds really did detract from my experience here. Parking was a bitch (though to be expected for SF, even after dark), the exhibits were crowded, the film viewings filled up, and the lines for cocktails were way too long. As a result, we didn't view any films, drink any cocktails, or watch any demonstrations.  I did like the idea of the exhibits. They had a salt booth teaching the differences in various salts, a nitrogen ice cream booth, one for teaching knife technique, a tofu- and cheese-making demonstration, and one for making caviar out of jelly. There was one demonstration about taste buds and nerves that I really enjoyed. They brought sweet-blockers and sour-blockers, along with various sweet and sour items (lemons, twizzlers, sugar packets, preserved mango) to experience. So, three stars for the thought and the learning that went on in here.The only problem was, we didn't actually /do/ anything. I have no idea what the films were because we were unable to get in.   Oh, and the Tactile Dome is for kids. Just trust me on this.",
