    "review_text": "I ate here a few months ago with my boyfriend. He asked me last night when we were coming back. I realized that I had wanted to post a review but life got in the way. We made a reservation on a Tuesday evening. The place was packed. We were promptly greeted and sat. Our server, Aldo was amazing and on point. He was knowledgeable about the food and made great recommendations.The support staff were also on point. The food runner dropped each dish with an description of the food. The bussers cleared with efficiency. Another server filled our empty wine glasses before we got a chance to realize we even needed a refill. I work in the industry and appreciate team work when I see it.  We ordered the blistered peppers, deviled eggs, crudo, lamb skewers and the duck. Every dish was presented well and yummy. We ordered a second deviled eggs before dessert because they were that good. The lamb skewers and crudo were my favorite. The eggs and duck were my boyfriend's favorite.   Yes the prices were a bit high but the quality of food, service, atmosphere and experience was worth it. I never ate at the old Fog City so I can't compare the two but I do recommend it to friends and customers that ask me of a great place to eat in the city. I will be back soon and can't wait to have those lamb skewers again. FYI: the blistered peppers added to the lamb skewers is delish!",

He was patient with our group and didn't make us feel rushed while still maintaining a steady service pace.   The food. The food. I will definitely be returning and spending my hard earned money here. I mean they can just take it by the barrels. P.S. I really want to try the drink they have aging in that barrel in the bar area. Cheeseburger was delicious. I had a bite of the salmon dish also great. I might have that next time.   My drink had milk in it. It was citrusy and sweet and delicious. Waiter knew what he was talking about. I really wish I remembered his name. If you're reading this, thank you, thank you, thank you. I had a wonderful dining experience because of you.  The dessert. The pumpkin bread pudding with pumpkin spice ice cream and caramel bourbon sauce was orgasmic. It could have it's own review.   That night I slept well. Food coma survivor extraordinaire here.",

The remodel was nice by opening up the floor. We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. Once seated we asked for bread three times, ordered our appetizers and entrees. Bread came after a long wait. Water was poured for some and the pitcher was left empty. Food quality was over all good. In a city of vegans and vegetarians not one item off and on the menu existed. It was looked down upon when we asked for lemon to flavor the blan cauliflower. Food came to the table we did not order and billed us for. Vegetable sides came after entr\u00e9es. \u00a0The menu should be labelled with small plates and big plates because the portions of some items are on the small side.",

    "review_text": "I first dined at Fog City through a YEE held here last month. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-hello-fog-tober-san-francisco?hrid=hB57NL0N339RN1D3PSn9BQ\">yelp.com/biz/elite-event\u2026</a>) As I showed the No1DP the pictures and explained what I had that night, he saw how much fun I had at the event and wanted to experience the restaurant himself the next time he saw me. I came back here one month later with the No1DP and friend/fellow Yelper Aren A., who initially took me to the YEE here as his +1.  CONCEPT: Originally known as the Fog City Diner before dropping the \"diner\" label. Looking from previous pictures no decor from the original restaurant remain, save the views of the Embarcadero. What did remain were the core elements of what made this restaurant famous - small plates.   VENUE: Looks to be an upscale \"diner\" with the more overt diner decorations removed - hues of brown enumerate the area. There's a big central bar area with the booths circling the bar.  SERVICE: Excellent service. She warned us about the long prep time for the chicken and offered to replace my drink when the No1DP accidentally toppled over my Milk Punch.  COCKTAILS - Milk Punch, $11 (Bourbon, Brandy, Rum, Citrus &amp; Spices, Sugar, Clarified Milk). This was my cocktail throughout the night as I fell in love with it back at the YEE. I could not taste any hint of the alcohol as everything in this drink was mixed well. - Grandpa's Breakfast, $12 (Famous Grouse Scotch, Allspice Dram, Combier Kummel, Lemon, Honey, Whiskey Barrel Bitters). One of No1DP's drinks. He enjoyed his drink as the whiskey and ingredients went smoothly. I liked it because of the cup it was served in, which is more appropriate for coffee.  - Paper Chase, $11 (Junipero Gin, Cappelletti Apertivo, Dolin Dry, Raspberry). One of Aren's drinks, tasted \"too much like Robitussin\". We eventually told our waitress, who took it off the final bill.   PLATES - Local Oysters on the Half Shell, $3.50/oyster (Oak Barrel Aged Hot Sauce, Shallot Mignonette). Oysters were a bit on the small side. The hot sauce and mignonette went well with the brine.  - Deviled Eggs, $8 (Grain Mustard, Crispy Quinoa, Bacon). Fell in love with this at first bite at the YEE. The creamy egg serve as base for the crispy quinoa and bacon.  - Iacopi Farms Brussels Sprouts, $10 (Asian Pear, Ponzu, Togarashi). Didn't like the pears but the togarashi spices gave the sprouts a slight spicy kick. - Crab Cakes, $11 (Basil Aioli, Oven Charred Cherry). The actual crab cake was decent but the taste improved with the aioli, which didn't have too much basil. - Broccoli Di Cicco, $11 (Flame Grilled with Lemon, Garum, Fiordolio Olive Oil, Garlic Chips). Tasted a lot like broccoli but there was so much flavor into the garlic chips.  - Wood Oven Whole Chicken, $38 (Brentwood Corn, Bacon, Fingerling Potatoes, Kimchi Butter, Spiced Salt). This is actually a larger plate but we treated it as a small plate and final dish. You have to order this in advance as it takes at least 30 minutes cook time. The meat was tender and juicy all through the chicken - no dry spots on the breast. Rub was simple yet delicious. The corn and potatoes took some of the chicken juice and as a result went well with the chicken.  SWEETS - The \"B\" Bomb, $7 (Glazed French Cruller, Vanilla Frozen Custard, Egg Yolk Caramel). My dessert, as I still wanted some of the frozen custard. I realized it looked and tasted like a fancy donut with fancy ice cream. Though I liked my dessert it was a bit on the plain side. - Pumpkin Brioshe (sic) Bread Pudding, $8 (Bourbon Caramel Sauce, Pumpkin Spiced Ice Cream). Aren's dessert. A solid piece of bread pudding, though I didn't taste much pumpkin. - Panna Cotta Pudding Cake, $8 (Dark Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, Caramel, Candied Peanuts). No1DP's dessert, the chocolate smooth yet not too rich. Candied peanuts are made to be eaten with the dessert. I should've ordered this dessert instead.  FINAL BILL: ~$245.  I look forward to trying more small plates here. Note that the Milk Punch and the Frozen Custard are on the 7x7 Big Drink and Big Eat, respectively.",

We were SO glad we came back to this place. We sat at the bar, talked with the bartender the whole time, he was so great, watching him work was so much fun and entertaining, learning all about mixing cocktails, chatting with us the whole time but working extremely hard and efficiently for the waiter staff. We had amazing fries and a fabulous classic burger. Had the opportunity to speak with Bruce, the chef/owner who is a down to earth, friendly guy who clearly takes pride in his restaurant and rightly so. We had a great time, learned about different types of food and drink, it was a great atmosphere, we'd definitely go back and sit at the bar. They have a community table that is on a first come basis along with the bar, reservations are definitely required for tables. Food was superb, thanks Bruce, see you again soon!!! G&amp;G",

When we arrived it was probably closer to 10 pm on a Saturday night, the place was semi full, we asked for a booth and the polite hostess seated us at the bar while we waited for a booth. We've always come across this place when there have been a long wait. Not this time!   We waited maybe ten minutes, I had enough time to order a drink before we were seated at a comfy booth looking out onto the street. I already had my drink in hand and our server took hubby's order of coffee when we seated. Coffee was good, I point this out, because, we've ordered coffee at other places and we can't keep track of the number of places who serve crappy coffee on the off hours! Fog City is everything I imagined, cool, vibrant, superb service! Great ambiance, great lighting,great people watching and great atmosphere! We probably should've felt under dressed, we were dressed in our SF attire, looking like total tourists(dressed to look the part for our Yelp party). We were dressed in SF hoodies, and sneakers, lol! Never felt out of place. Noticed that there were others who were dressed to the \"Nines\" but couldn't pay for their bills, lol! How many times does the place have to decline your credit card, people!! Yup, saw that you paid in cash after so many rejections.   We quickly glanced over the menu, ordered the cheeseburger and the Chinese chicken salad, we mentioned to our server that we will be sharing both and when our food came out, the cheeseburger was cut in half and cooked EXACTLY the way we specified! Cool! The cheeseburger was similar to an In n Out burger with a better quality of meat. Cut symmetrically, with everything intact with every delicious bite! I also ordered a Miyagi oyster shooter, for the helluvit! I was in San Diego the week before and had the same oyster and it solidifies my judgement that the oyster in SD was not what I expected! The Chinese chicken salad satisfied all your senses with different textures and tastebuds were on overload with so many different tastes!   I'm not sure, there was a need for a server here, they provide you with a carafe of water, the food had absolutely no complaints, it was everything I had imagined! I will definitely come back if the place wasn't so damn busy. That's a good thing! It's pricey, but damn good!",

The food is simply outstanding, with impeccable, fresh-from-the-market ingredients and phenomenal flavors that explode on the palate.  The wood-fired broccoli is one of the best veg dishes I've ever eaten; I get it almost every time. But the artichokes, now in season, give it a run for the money. And the deviled eggs with crispy quinoa and bacon are divine, but I was also impressed with the dollops of ahi tuna tartare on bite-sized rice cakes.  All of the entrees have been delectable, from the savory whole deboned chicken to the delightful wild boar ribs to to spicy lamb skewers to just-caught fish specials.   I'm normally not a dessert person (I prefer a sweet cocktail such as the Fog City Milk Punch or the Wisconsin Fix, both remarkable) but the house-made custard with caramel sauce is out of this world.   Service is always excellent, but last night, Tobias took it to a new level. I felt like I was dining at a very attentive friend's house rather than a restaurant. Unparalleled service like that cannot be taught; it's innate in a person's heart.   Have I had a couple dishes I wasn't keen on? Sure, but other Yelpers have adored them. And nothing has sullied any visit enough to make me love this place less.  The incredible food, and the cocktails that are among the best in town, and the lovely service, and the fact that a manager always stops by, and the ambiance that's now chic and modern and fun, all add up to a winning experience for me every time.",

He approached us and simply said 'hi. want to split a bottle of wine?\" clearly seeing what kind of gal I was. However, this night I order a drink instead.   And what a drink! 5 stars just for it. The kind of drink that you would finish in 30 seconds because it was so amazing. Make sure you order it- Fog City Milk Punch. Sounds totally gross, goes down so incredibly easy.   From there we got appetizers of oysters, fries, and broccoli, mains AND desserts. Everything was yummy- my partner loved the fries more than I did but i'm a steak fry kind of chick. \u00a0He got short ribs and I got the special of the day- wood-fired tuna. It sounded like it was going to be a mess but the olives, fish stock, beans....all came together with the fish.   I'm happy this place is by my house but my wallet is sad. It was a bit spendy for a \"quick bite\" after the gym but we did stay and eat our fill for two hours. I'll be back- next time for brunch.   A couple of notes- the table next to us ordered all veggie plates and they must have had 7 different types of non meat based dishes. A good bet for you cow savers. Our broccoli side dish was MASSIVE and I ate it warmed up in the oven for the next two meals.   Lastly, rumor has it they serve box lunch for noontimes. If you work around there, I would totally 100% check it out.",

    "review_text": "Let's talk about chicken. If you're like me, you usually avoid ordering chicken at restaurants b/c there's nothing worse than dry chicken. Well, I don't know how Fog City does it, but they're chicken is mouth watering moist. On the reals, I was saying \"WOW\" during every bite, and the chicken even stayed moist during our last few bites.  So if you want to experience an amazing whole chicken that'll serve two, swing by Fog City. Additional details of my visit are below:  My GF and I sat at the bar where we were served by Matt, the bartender. Awesome dude who is very friendly and attentive. Here's what we ordered:  Deviled Eggs: They add a piece of bacon to the top and sprinkle the egg with toasted quinoa...MIND BLOWN  Halibut Crudo Appetizer: The watermelon is a nice touch and it's good, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've had.  Wood Oven Chicken: DAMN GOOD  Apple Pie Dessert: Delicious",

However, the room gets quite loud as it fills as the ceiling is quite low. \u00a0But I tend to like a venue with energy and Fog City has that. \u00a0I also like a place where the waitstaff knows the menu. \u00a0Fog City has that as well. \u00a0My lovely young server was able to describe and discuss the menu in detail and to make suggestions. \u00a0  I started with wood grilled tomato soup that was topped with basil and stracciatella. The cheese made all the difference and elevated a nice bowl of soup to something considerably better. \u00a0  Roasted baby carrots came with a mole sauce and slivered almonds. \u00a0The mole sauce and almonds were wonderful. \u00a0The carrots were somewhat pallid. \u00a0I had thought that the roasting would concentrate the sweetness of the vegetable but these remained bland. \u00a0Nevertheless, this was a nice appetizer.  Half a planked trout came with fingerling potatoes, olives, and a grilled lemon. \u00a0This was the highlight of my meal. \u00a0The trout was perfectly prepared. \u00a0Not overcooked and not messed with. \u00a0Just fresh, lovely fish to sate my appetite. The only way this plate could have been improved would have been to provide a small bowl of the mole sauce from my carrots for me to dip the potatoes into. \u00a0  Fog City is on track to become a new, landmark restaurant in San Francisco.",

Remember how bad the service was?\" \"Yea, but it got renovated remember?\" \"Uhhh? Did they renovate the staff?\" So then became our first time after the renovation of Fog City Diner.  I had made an appointment on Open Table and then had called them ahead of time to say we were early. They were able to seat us. Wow! This is a remarkably different place. Hustling for a Friday night, beautiful new interior design. I spotted dish ware from Haven, Always beautiful pieces of high quality and locally made.  The bar is open, The kitchen is an open concept. The management serves as well as the staff.  We started with the hand cut furikake fries with garlic aioli. Amazing, filling, addicting. The pickled gold shrimp with fennel, sweet onion, celery, cilantro avocado, and serrano chiles had you tasting all the flavors. Wonderfuly prepared. The roasted duck leg with roasted raddichio, delicate \u00a0squash, asian pear, and Manadori Balsamic over the side salad was delicious. I even had to stop the waitress and ask where the Balsamic was from. It's an aged Balsamic from Italy.  Service was continuous. They were great with service, after every entree to stay in touch with each customer.Communal tables. Bar. Then table tops.  The only place I found disappointing were the French Cruellers. I love French Food, but this one had no taste.  WIll be back again. Everything great, and I love the new Fog City. Just don't get the French Cruellers.",

    "review_text": "Fog City...Oh Fog City.   I actually really used to like Fog City before the renovation. You know, when it was still a legitimate diner and serving up delicious truffle fries without adding on shit tons of Furikake seasoning. But then they went and renovated it and alright, alright it really is beautiful! It is a complete transformation and worthy of applause. The wood fire kitchen is my favorite part- it really sets the tone.   But here's what I didn't love- I had a reservation for two but was not seated until 15 minutes after the reservation in spite of there being MANY open tables. I ordered the burger and while I love a delicious bougie SF burger, I can still get down with regular burgers to the liking of In-N-Out, Roam, etc. NEVER AGAIN. This was the worst burger I've ever had and I am shocked that anyone who has had the burger liked it enough to give it a good review.  The bun was soggy. The lettuce was sparse. The meat didn't really taste like anything and was a thin patty. You pay $15 for a shitty burger that doesn't even come with fries. Man. I got through about 2 bites and called it quits.  The service was shotty. They didn't even come around enough for me to tell them the burger was unpleasant. When our server did come around, she looked already irritated. Also, it took 45 minutes for us to get our two orders of fries, a burger, and soup. It was a situation where every table around us seemed to be getting their food before us which I might be more understanding of if our food was outstanding but it just wasn't.   In the restaurant's defense (and the reason for the extra star or else it really would be a one star), they comped the burger off the bill and was apologetic about it. But I will not be back at Fog City.",

The roast chicken was delicious (not quite Zuni Cafe-delicious, but really good), and even the cabbage in the skillet was good. The star of the night, however, was the roasted carrots with mole, which was unlike anything I've had before. It was so good we ordered a second plate of carrots. We also enjoyed the asparagus, deviled eggs, and brussels sprouts (which were some of the best ones I've had that didn't include bacon or pancetta). The cocktails were also pretty good, especially the barrel-aged Saboteur. Unfortunately, they lose a star because the service didn't quite live up to the food. Our waiter would disappear for long periods of time, and it took us an abnormally long time to get and pay our check. The food was a little bit on the pricey side too, but nothing too surprising considering we're in SF. It's a cool space with a good location, so I'm pretty sure I'll be back in the future, probably when I have more guests in town.",

The staff are warm and welcoming in an authentic way. And the food is beyond delicious.   Those fries with the nori on top? Seriously? We loved them. (As did everyone else; we saw them on every table and at the bar.) I'd go back for the spicy pole beans any day of the week - amazing. A lady even grabbed my arm as I walked in and she walked out, and she whispered, \"lamb skewers\" in my ear. Didn't know her, but she was looking out for me. (That really happened.)

    "review_text": "As a long time Fog City Diner patron I was excited to experience their new venture, I was both open minded but also aware of its past.  As we arrived the restaurant we were impressed by the new design and overall attention to detail. Much of the old experience is gone (minus a similar booth setup), but the new design is both crisp and tasteful. \u00a0Unfortunately however, anything good about the new concept stops at good design.  The Menu:  The menu is not at all reminiscent of the old class Fog City Diner. I get it, they wanted to drop the diner concept and move into something more upscale and sophisticated. \u00a0The new approach is \"small plates\" something that has gained popularity among restaurants over the past few years. \u00a0Personally, I'm not a fan of tapas style with this type of cuisine, but I understand it.   There are a few nice dishes on the menu ranging from a more simple butter lettuce salad to a more robust/hearty dish-- the chicken. \u00a0There's probably something for everyone on the menu, but I would have loved to see them keep a few or the original Fog City Diner dishes like their famous chicken paillard or their classic sourdough leek loaf. I think they could have pulled this off while still offering a fresh new innovative menu. It would have certainly kept all of its longtime patrons happy.   Our dishes all came out at the wrong time. \u00a0For example a cheesburger came out for one person (yes, I know it's intended to share, but not really practical to do so), but our chicken dish didn't come out for another 30 minutes.   All in all, the food was average but not up to Fog City Diner standards.  The Service:  To put it lightly, the service stunk. Our waiter was careless and often combative. We asked the status of our chicken dish that was over 30 minutes late and was told that plates come out as they are made. We then asked the manager separately and was once again given a lecture on how their dishes comes as their made, later to find out that the waiter never fired the dish. \u00a0Their problem was passed off as ours, a big no no in service- particularly as a \"new\" restaurant. After all the problems with the timing of our meal no one else even came over to apologize or explain. \u00a0It would not have been that difficult for the GM to stop by and provide an explanation and apology for the mishap (needless to say it ruined our experience).  I really wanted to like the new Fog City but I think the management should take note of the recent reviews (many 1 star from what I can see), and pay closer attention to what their customers want. \u00a0Secondly, I think there's a huge opportunity for them to improve their level of service. Patrons don't dine out to get schooled on how things work- just make great food and deliver good service. Recognize when things aren't going right, and make them right- it's not that difficult. \u00a0Lastly, they should seriously consider adding a few of the classic Fog City Diner items back on the menu.",

When a friend took me out for a belated birthday lunch, we decided to go here to cross it off my list. We shared the much-regaled Deviled Eggs: the crispy bacon bits were delightful, but it was still just a deviled egg at the end of the day.   I got the burger (had been craving a gourmet burger since NOT ordering it at NOPA a few days earlier) and asked for furikake fries, in place of the regular side. The melty American cheese was a major throwback to Mickey D days and childhood. Although the wood-fired grill in the back is quite impressive, my burger wasn't quite as smokey as I would have liked. I appreciated the generously thick patty, but I wish it had actually been smaller, since it made the lettuce, onion, and tomato toppings feel unproportional. Couldn't finish it all.  My friend got the smoked salmon dish. Although quite pricey (close to $20?) for 2 slices of rye bread with toppings, the smoked salmon was one of the best I've enjoyed. I hate overly salty smoked fish! But this smoked salmon was definitely not too salty, and it had a fresh flavor that almost tasted like sashimi. It was beautifully garnished with microgreens, dill fronds, and creamy avocado and plated against a dark contrast. I probably wouldn't pay that much for that little food myself, but I enjoyed a taste of her selection.  Overall, if I want somewhere to take a break while walking along the Embarcadero again, I might stop by to catch a game at the bar or a quick bite at the cute tables outside. But definitely not a destination meal in the future. Big shout-out to the wait staff who kept our glasses filled but never made us feel bothered or fawned over.",

I must say, the house cocktails were AMAZING! \u00a0Innovative ingredients that do not seem at home in a glass come together to create something wondrous. \u00a0I would try them all in one sitting if I could. \u00a0The beer list had some that I had never heard of before. \u00a0One of the servers (who I am assuming is also the head chef from his demeanor) suggested the IPA. \u00a0Good suggestion! \u00a0I personally hate IPAs with a passion, but I found this one to be surprisingly tasty. \u00a0I believe that it was called the Denogginizer. \u00a0Even the non-alcoholic cocktails were spectacular.  The service was above average. \u00a0Our original waiter took over 10 minutes after the second half of our party sat down to take new drink orders, but the head chef who brought out the food and other drinks was very fast while still being extremely engaging and funny. \u00a0While watching him it looked like he brought the food out to every table and chatted with the patrons!  We did not eat much as we were headed down to the Ghirardelli factory, but I wanted a snack and settled on the Kale salad. \u00a0It had very soft leaves and fresh fruit, but I was not overly impressed and did not eat very much of the salad. \u00a0This had nothing to do with the quality or preparation of the food, but more with my specific cravings at the time. \u00a0The chef immediately noticed the unfinished salad and removed it from the table. \u00a0Disregarding my insistence that I was not dissatisfied with the salad or the restaurant, the chef removed the salad from the tab. \u00a0It was easy to see that he took pride in his work and did not want his customers to have a bad experience. \u00a0  Overall, I highly recommend coming here for the drinks. \u00a0I am planning on stopping by every time that I am in SF. \u00a0It is a bit on the expensive side (as is most of the city), but worth every penny.",

It was fresh (we were told it was alive 3 hours prior) and immaculately prepared. One order per 2 people for $30 - well worth it. Whatever the Brussels were prepared in was so flavorful and they were charred well. There was some kind of pear or Apple chunks mixed in which were unnecessary.  The Mac n cheese was great. The fries were meh as were the doughnuts. The beets were good but the goat cheese water that they sat in wasn't the best.  The service was decent but we had to ask several times for dishes to be cleared.  I had the Vodka fix which was delicious but tiny. The wines came with a healthy pour. I would eat here again and try other items.",

The deviled eggs with sprinkles of bacon were a dream come true! The Veggies, especially the brussel sprouts, were just amazing. No one does veggies like these guys. The Chicken was truly mind-blowing. You must order the whole chicken!!! There was special salt you sprinkle on top that comes with it that I went crazy for. The frozen coffee granita with vanilla ice cream was a dream come true. Loved it so much I went back a 2nd time. A top new favorite.",

    "review_text": "I went on a double-date here on Friday, October 28 and had a wonderful experience. I had never actually been to the old Fog City Diner before so had nothing stuck in my mind to compare it to. It seems that a lot of the other reviewers are hung up on the old Fog City Diner and having a hard time accepting that it's a completely new restaurant which is a shame for them.  They layout of the restaurant is very open so even though it was a very busy Friday night with a packed bar as well it never felt crowded. They have comfortable booths and an open kitchen with a big wood-fire oven and the overall aesthetic of the restaurant is modern but warm. The one thing I didn't get about the decor was the weird spaceman by the bathroom, that seemed out of place to me but not a big deal.   The most important part of our experience was the delicious food and cocktails. We were pretty hungry on Friday evening and definitely made sure we got a solid sampling of their unique menu. Highlights that I recommend you don't miss out on on the food side for me were the deviled eggs, the pork cheeks plate and the clams dish. \u00a0We also went a little crazy on the desserts which might have been the best part of the meal. The home-cooked crullers, frozen custard, and Panna Cotta were all so delicious and the perfect exclamation mark on a well-rounded delicious meal.  One final thought, make sure you try the Fog City Milk Punch cocktail. I had no idea what to expect based on all of the ingredients (bourbon, rum, brandy, citrus, milk, etc..) but it a delicious sweet drink that also packed a good punch. Overall, the new Fog City hits it out of the park in all aspects and I can't wait to go back!",

    "review_text": "This place is a venture back to the not too distant SF past. Pre tech boom, pre dot-com bust/boom, back in the days when a policeman would grab a ruffian with a crookedly knotted skinny necktie and gutterly threaten, \"go back south of Market.\" Despite its remodel and appearance of a modern restaurant, its clientele has a definite old school SF vibe to it; this is good people watching when you get tired of looking at recent SF residents.  Like: Furikake fries. Don't you take my crumbs! Roasted baby carrots, cauliflower nuggets, and grilled asparagus; they do veggies well.  Dessert, frozen custard on cruller with a side of caramelly marshmallowy sauce.   Dislike: My entree was a rib dish that was taken off the menu a few days later. Edible, but overcooked and forgettable. I'm glad Fog City decided to forget it as well.  Hit or miss: Ahi tartare. The ahi was fresh and flavorful, but the rice cake was in-between chewy and crispy.  Go because you or your guests are conservative and a little old school, but still want to try a modern menu without going full do-you-know-who-harvested-this-oyster-locavore. Go because you want to see local newscasters on break. Go because it's not difficult to get a seat and it's a comfortable spot to enjoy the company of friends. If I could give 1/2 stars (Yelp, please!), it would be 3.5 stars.",

Nothing really wow-d me compared to other places Deviled Eggs- Great touch with the bacon. Bacon makes everything 10x better! Brussels Sprouts- YUM, I'm never usually a fan but this is delicious. Handcut Furikake Fries- My must get starter every time I dine. YUMMY  Smoked Salmon Sandwich- I ended up just picking the salmon off and leaving the greens and bread. OK Saigon Dip Sandwich-Sounds good on the menu, but just mediocre Fog City Burger and Fries- Good, your average burger Sesame Chicken Salad- Overall my favorite! Very flavorful and I'm not a big salad person. YUMMY. There was tons of flavor in every bite.  Will definitely dine there again soon.",

Sadly right from the walk in a totoal bummer. \u00a0 We arrived at 5 looking to sit 7 and they said \"sure\" but they don't open until 5:30 (fine we'll wait)...oh no, sorry we have a reservation coming in at 7:15. \u00a0 \"if you could eat and be out of here we'll seat you\"...hummm, ya that's how a reservation works people. \u00a0 If you can feed us in an hour &amp; half we'll be out.  We ordered cocktails (the gal at the bar...SO RUDE, REALLY SWEET HEART? YOUR NOT AT SUR...TAKE A BREAK AND MANAGE MY MANHATTAN IN UNDER 15 MINUTES..NEVER ONCE ASKED IF WE WANTED ANOTHER, JOKE.) \u00a0and the children has sodas, sitting at a side table. \u00a0 The man at the desk was HOUNDING THE KIDS to move because they had a 5:30 reservation coming...we told him they will move at 5:30 as we are sitting at that time too. \u00a0 At 5:01 the front desk man to leave, they needed the table. \u00a0 THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY! \u00a0 We asked the kids to stand by the door until our we sat down...2 minutes later. \u00a0 Mind you...that table didn't have a soul sitting there for 20 minutes. \u00a0THEY NEED TO CHILL.  The dinner menu was a train wreck...plates to share \"WHAT DOES THAT MEAN\". I believe when something is to \"Share\" it's large enough for 2-3 guests. \u00a0 Not even close...it was a 20 minutes dissertation from the waitress about what is big enough for 2+ and what was really for one, HUH?, \u00a0 Clearly, our table was ordering traditional: salads, burgers for the kids with fries, carrots. \u00a0   The adults were battling over how much was enough for 4 people...MAJOR HEADACHE. \u00a0 \u00a0Turned out that the burger is a standard flat burger, no possible way it would feed more than one (cutting it into four doesn't make it feed more. \u00a0Make a huge burger and that would make sense)...no sides on any entree. \u00a0 \u00a0 Then to cap it off, there was a a first wave of food then 30 minutes later another wave of food and then the final wave because the portions were just random. \u00a0 All the portions were for one...other than the chicken.  The food was good and although it was way more work than it was worth it tasted very good. \u00a0I have to say the staff (NOT THE BAR STAFF...BUGGERS) was friendly and very nice, however, it really seemed disorganized and unprofessional. \u00a0 SIDE NOTE: BRUSSEL SPROUTS...AMAZING!",

Fog City is a place I've been meaning to try for a while, so I made a reservation for a work lunch. The food here is not bad and probably worthy of 4 stars, but the service and steep prices knock off one star for me.  The ambience is very trendy, with almost exclusively dim, natural lighting and dark wood textures. The water cups are encircled with \"Fog City\" around the base. It is quite loud in here for a more upscale restaurant, so maybe not the best place for a professional lunch.  I got the Smoked Salmon Smorrebrod ($17), which I still don't know how to pronounce. It's an open-face sandwich of smoked salmon, egg salad, avocado, peppers, and a generous garnish of herbs on top. Again, I do think the food here is quite tasty, and I really loved the sharp, spicy kick of the peppers. The ingredients are fresh and beautifully arranged. Both of our sandwiches came on casually-uniquely-shaped wooden slabs, because porcelain plates are for the mainstream.  The service here is quite slow and inattentive, except for the kind people refilling the water. I had to ask for the waiter multiple times to take our order and deal with the check. We were able to finish our meal in under an hour, so it wasn't entirely awful, but I did feel a bit hysterical constantly trying to flag someone down. It was pretty busy for lunch, so I would recommend making a reservation!",

There are plenty of other items on the menu to consider in case you're not into cheeseburgers. Deviled eggs, seasonal salad, fresh oysters. You've heard the term American (New), yes? Not to mention milk punch and a list of classic cocktails that well executed.  Did I mention that they serve custard? Really, really good custard. That's coming from a St. Louis gal, too. It's no Ted Drewes, but I don't think Fog City is trying to make concretes here. It's just rich delicious custard.

Me: \u00a0No, we just want to grab a drink at the bar. Bouncer: \u00a0Bar is all full. Me: \u00a0It looks like there's plenty of standing room. Bouncer: \u00a0We don't do that here. Me: \u00a0Do what? Allow people to stand at a bar?  Bouncer: \u00a0Yeah.  Errr, WTF. \u00a0Okay. \u00a0So this bar operates entirely different than EVERY OTHER BAR IN THE WORLD. \u00a0Awesome. \u00a0Took my business to the Waiheke Island Yacht Club where we were graciously greeted and provided drinks at the bar that was STANDING ROOM ONLY at the time.

This is a great spot for a classy last minute Sunday brunch when all the super cool spots are already booked or don't take reservations (I'm talking to you Foreign Cinema and Plow)  It is definitely pricy - one of my friends got the $17 chicken soup - CHICKEN SOUP for SEVENTEEN DOLLARS - WTF?! \u00a0He said it was good, but I dunno how good it could possibly have been.  I ordered the Hot brown sandwich, I have never had one, but have seen it in many travel shows about Kentucky and they are supposed to be fantastic. This was indeed a damn fine sammy, the bacon was super smokey and the sauce was like crack sauce. \u00a0Order it and thank me later.   We ordered \u00a0doughnuts as a starter (2 doughnuts to an order) and they were good, but I gotta say if I order doughnuts in a restaurant, they better come out piping hot (at the very least warm) out of the fryer - these were good, but room temp, so you can skip it, as tempting as they sound. \u00a0  The views would have been amazing if there wasn't construction netting blocking the bay views.",

On top of all of this I came back later and sat outside to use my laptop real fast and they came out and told me outdoor seating was for customers only. There were 10 separate tables three of which were being sat in and they are telling me I should move because it's for clients only???

Came in for an early dinner, almost empty, we were greeted and sat immediately. \u00a0Overall I will say the service was very good. \u00a0Our waitress was nice, but she kept over compensating for everything and tried to tell us how to eat the dishes, which is usually pretty self-explanatory.  Order: Fried Artichokes Brocollini w/ Garlic Lamb Kebabs (2) People  The fried artichokes were presented nicely and very tasty with the aioli dipping sauce. \u00a0Nice seasoning and plenty of \"flesh\" to eat. \u00a0The whole thing wasn't edible but most was crispy enough to eat.  The Brocollini was delicious and actually was my favorite part.  The Lamb Kebabs were under-whelming and there really wasn't any care in presentation. \u00a0it reminds me of when I make tacos at home and just slice up a tomato, some onions and cilantro and have it all out to put together. \u00a0It was just a place with two kebabs and sliced onion and tomatoes, to me if you are going to charge $19-$22 or whatever it was, there should be something to it. \u00a0The dish was served with lettuce leaves and we were then told how to put everything in it and eat it..... \u00a0anyway.  Also, one of my biggest pet peeves was the time between the vegetable coming out and the entre, about 10-15 minutes. \u00a0I want to eat my veggie with my protein, not as a separate course.  Overall it was a nice night out, but honestly, I just don't see the value. \u00a0I am use to over-priced Napa, but at least with Napa the menu items are fairly unique, so if I'm dropping $12 on an app, $8 on a veggie and $20+ on an entre it's usually worth the money.  I won't go out of my way to go back, but I'm sure there are some items they do very well, some of the other stuff coming out looked tasty.",

We all joked that was the best thing to happen to us because Fog City was the only thing we could talk about for the next week. It was THAT good!  Friends asked what kind of place it was... I guess one would describe it as a contemporary upscale diner?  The place is super cute, equipped with a wood-fired over and large grill that serve as the centerpieces.  For starters we went with Hand-cut Furikake Fries with Garlic Aioli. The white sauce for dipping was heaven (not sure on name).  We also ordered four Chilled Local Oysters served with a barrel-aged hot sauce, shallots, mignonette and parsley. They were so good we ordered another round of 4. One of our guests said he'd just eat these all night. (see pic)  The Brussels Sprouts with Asian Pears (we originally ordered Broccoli, but they ended up bringing out these). The brussel sprouts were a nice surprise. Although we had these at Delfina the night before, the pears sent these over the top.  The Oven Roasted Baby Carrots was the other veggies we ordered. They were a touch on the sweet side and were served with a black garlic mole, almonds, and cotija cheese. The garlic mole sauce was super unique and a fresh approach.  The Fog City Burger was kind of lost in the shuffle with all of the food we got. House-made Bun, smoked tomato aioli, F.C. american cheese, tomato, onion bread &amp; butter pickles. One of us ordered it as well done but it came out medium rare. I was happy with that though. hehe Extremely tasty!  Their signature Wood Oven Chicken was absolutely beautiful. Accompanied by charred brentwood corn, crispy potatoes and spiced maldon salt, the chicken could easily serve two people. Soooooooo good! (see pic)  Saving the best for last was the Berkshire Pork Cheeks served on a bed of bacon braised romano beans, hatch chilies, broccoli, and soft polenta. That pork cheeks was some of the best pork I've ever had in my entire life - It was so succulent that you didn't even need a fork to separate it. Each bite deserved a fork-full of each component on the dish, not just the meat. The polenta and the red sauce (name?) was the clincher. Whenever I head back up to San Francisco, it's this dish that I'll be craving!  The only letdown of the evening was the Grilled Beef Tongue with Chanterelle mushrooms, roasted turnips, mustard greens, and bacon vinaigrette. It was best described as a salad with a few bits of beef tongue. Everyone at the table tried it, but no one went back to it.  You know you loved your meal when you can't stop talking about it... Fog city - we'll be back!",

Also, I was curious what a $35 whole chicken would taste like. Must be at least seven times better than a $5 Costco chicken right?! Well...it was dry.

We were met with a busy and noisy new environment. Within the first few moments, we ordered cocktails, one being a gin and tonic where two of the most popular gins in the world were not available - Bombay and Tanqueray. \u00a0  Plowing on, we ordered wine and food. \u00a0The wine arrived soon - the drinks never arrived and we asked one to the managers to delete the drinks from the order. \u00a0 Any sensitive restauranteur would have comped a desert or coffee - - - Fog City nothing.  One of the twists to the new restaurant, as specified on the menu, is plate sharing. \u00a0One problem: the proper utensils for the sharing of food (spoons, forks, etc.) were never provided prior to our asking. \u00a0  Another issue was that for a tomato salad consisting of many delicious and small components, a spoon or cracker or baguette would have have been superior to incessant stabbing with a fork yielding minimal results.  The food was basically fine; however, while most restaurants provide some form of bread with which to soak up the sauces, not Fog City. No bread was ever provided.  After desert, the bill instantly appeared. \u00a0Guess what was on the bill? $25.50 of cocktails never received!  I called the waitress to inform her I was incensed to discover the cocktail charge and before I even got the words out of my mouth . . . \u00a0she knew far too quickly about the error in billing. Hmmm?   This comment of hers would lead a reasonable person to believe that perhaps alcohol-infused patrons might overlook careful scrutiny of their bill. \u00a0Thus, Fog City would be $25.50 richer and their patrons $25.50 poorer.  The only conclusion to be drawn is buyer beware.",

    "review_text": "I never got a chance to try Fog City Diner, but A &amp; I were downtown, for once, and decided to make a day of it.   We walked from the Ferry Building to the restaurant (now just Fog City), which was actually a good walk. All the outdoor tables were occupied, but only a few indoor tables were occupied.   A used to frequent Fog City Diner on an almost daily basis years ago and he was telling me how they really opened up and streamlined the layout when they remodeled. I never saw it before, but I am loving the new open layout.  FOOD * Warm old fashioned sugar dusted doughnuts - Warm, doughy o's of goodness! Simple, yet delicious. * Deviled eggs with bacon and crispy quinoa - There is a definite crispy crunchiness which you would think comes from the bacon, but it's actually the crispy quinoa. I don't know who thought of sprinkling that on the eggs, but whoever it was is absolutely brilliant! Now I want to make crispy quinoa and sprinkle it in everything too! * Furikake fries - I think I pretty much love Furikake anything, but these fries were truly delicious. I'd go here just to have these again. * Fog City Burger - The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. They cut it in half for us and the burger wasn't falling apart. The cheese really added to the flavor and I loved their special sauce. It also comes with a side of fries. Yes, more fries!!! Not Furikake, but still very good.  We were way too full for dessert, but there were several things on the menu that we would definitely come back to try.  PRICE About $50. for two including tax/tip, no drinks.  (Please excuse any errors. This review was written on my phone.)",

Better than Mel's Drive In.....not sure if that is saying much.   The food now is up to my standards.   AHI TUNA TARTARE served on Sticky Rice Cakes with Asian Pear, Wasabi, Sesame, Soy, Shiso Leaf-small bites size pieces. Really yummy. Love the crunch the rice cakes give with the tuna. Different from your typical won ton chips with tuna.   DEVILED EGGS with Crispy Quinoa, Bacon-this was so good. The crispy quinoa gave it that extra crunch. You have to really like mustard though, because they put Dijon mustard on the bottom of the egg, before they fill it with the yolk filling.   BRUSSELS SPROUTS \u00a0with Asian Pears, Ponzu-very well-seasoned. The pears add a nice touch to this dish.   CAULIFLOWER NUGGETS with Vadouvan Curry, Serrano Chile, Lime-this wasn't bad, but too much curry flavor for my liking.   FLAME GRILLED GARLIC SHRIMP with Tomato-Rosemary Pan Sauce, Garlic Chips-you get 4 pieces. Cooked perfectly and great flavor. Each shrimp was a decent size. It had a bunch of spinach on the bottom of the dish. Love!  WOOD OVEN CLAMS with Green Garlic Tomato Broth, Grilled Portobello Mushrooms, Straus Butter-pretty big size. Super yummy. Make sure you add the HAND-CUT FURIKAKE FRIES with Bonito Flakes, Garlic Aioli-it was crispy and thy give alot. Super yummy!",

It was kinda bland. \u00a0We heard Fog City's chicken was comparable to the roasted chicken salad at zuni's so we had to try it. It was good. The chicken was juicy and very flavorful. The dish came with cabbage, onions and potatoes. I can't really compare it to zuni's because it's different. but it was definitely tasty. Although we were stuffed, we couldn't pass up on desserts when we saw the menu - frozen custard, homemade donuts.... HmMmmmMmmm yum.",

It's probably the fault of the obnoxious 60something year old man next to us on a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMatch.com&amp;s=811cc30022d77156f869d2477f68d5823aaf9b46b799319ab032f2da80256579\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Match.com</a> first date, keep an eye out for his review I bet it's a doozy. \u00a0He ordered about 40 deviled eggs because as he proudly told his horrified date, he knew from his many former experiences here that one order wouldn't be enough. I'll return to this winner momentarily...  My dinner was fine to middling, nothing to rave on Yelp about. Crab cakes (fine), fries (big pool of oil in bottom of bowl), broccoli (way too much lemon) and lamb skewers (served with butter lettuce cups to make some kind of wrap). Nothing outstanding there and some dishes verging on the edge of not edible due to tasting yucky. HOWEVER, my \"I'm on a boat\" cocktail was very very palatable so well done thank you very much. The doughnut is FANTASTIC. Get it with frozen vanilla custard and don't touch that disgusting orange sludge sauce on the side.  Anyhow back to the awful man next to me on his date. \u00a0He told a not funny story in his bizarre fake deep radio announcer voice. I think it was about all the eggs not sitting well with him last time and then when his date suggested oysters (i think they were a tad pricey like almost deviled egg at urchin bistrot expensive) so he tried to sell her on the idea of them gettin ONE oyster each. When she said she was thinking a dozen he warned her multiple times he expected her to eat them all. I don't know how their date ended because we left but I do know that if I ever see this man again I will make sure to keep my distance, he loves eggs but they don't love him.",

    "review_text": "I loved the old Fog City Diner. \u00a0It was one of my favorite places to eat partly because it was a diner, it felt like a staple of San Francisco and my mom and I would eat there after working out at the tennis club. \u00a0I was sad to see the place close down but was very excited to see that it reopened with the same name. \u00a0I had even higher hopes when I found out the group behind Bix and Zero Zero, two restaurants I particularly like were behind the reopening of this once great restaurant.  The restaurant kept the same facade, with windows wrapping around the restaurant however the inside is where they truly did a great job. \u00a0They made the restaurant completely open with a very comfortable, beautiful feel yet kept the booths which really gives you the old diner feel. \u00a0I really felt they did an exceptional job with that. \u00a0There is a bar right in the middle of the restaurant and an open kitchen that looks like something out of William and Sonoma. \u00a0  We ordered a variety of things because it was plates to share and so we had the deviled eggs, furikake fries, clams, beef tongue and lamb. \u00a0The devil eggs were delicious; I usually don't like it and don't like eggs but they did a splendid job. \u00a0The furikake fries however weren't very good at all. \u00a0Too much oil in the fries and the fries were over fried along with not enough furikake and the mayo that came with it wasn't very good. \u00a0The furikake fries I had in Maui which had plenty of seasoning plus a great wasabi mayo was much better. \u00a0The clams didn't have any taste and the beef tongue had some vegetable in there that kind of ruined the dish. \u00a0I wasn't sure what it was but it wasn't very good. \u00a0The lamb was decent, came out in two long skewers and you ate like a lettuce wrap since they gave you lettuce, sauce and some condiments for it.  I really wanted the place to be much better but it wasn't as bad as my friend said it was (she said don't go, it's really not good). \u00a0I hope they improve the food because such a beautiful restaurant should have food to match its atmosphere.",

    "review_text": "We ordered the following: ahi tuna tartar, \u00a0furikake fries, Brussels sprouts, garden salad, whole chicken, wild boar ribs, oven baked clams, and heritage pork chop. We were a party of five and we were definitely stuffed!  Here's a review of the food:  The fries, oven baked clams, Brussels sprouts, and whole chicken were very tasty. The chicken, in particular, was very moist and tender, absolutely delicious!  The wild boar meat was good. It fell right off the bones beautifully but the flavor was very one dimensional and under seasoned. \u00a0As I was eating it, I kept wishing for something to balance the umami fat flavor. The slaw that came with it was okay with it bc it was on the sour side. It tasted like tajin's flavor chili salt that Mexicans eat with fruits.   The heritage pork chop itself was the \"worst\" dish for me because it was on the dry side, and the sauce/bed of red cabbage and Fuji Apple did not enhance the flavors. The combo did not meld well. \u00a0It was a flop IMO. \u00a0It was also really small.  This restaurant loves their balsamic vinegar because the salad dressing was mostly that. I love balsamic vinegar dressings normally, but this one was just not done well. Pass.   Here's one of the reasons why I didn't give them a higher review. The ahi tuna came out with a piece of hair in the crispy rice at the bottom. It was stuck in there, I tried to pull it out thinking maybe someone's hair just dropped on it but it was deeply rooted in the rice. I should have taken a picture but i didn't want to make a big deal. Sometimes, accidents happen, it's okay with me. \u00a0However, it's how it was handled that really bugged me.  I pointed the hair to a waiter, who was rightly apologetic. He took the plate away and probably told the waitress and manager. The manager then hesitatingly came over and slowly approached us like we were going to chew his ears out. (Except, we were all calm and smiling because we were still enjoying ourselves despite the hair.) He kept a good table distance away from us too when he \"apologized,\" it was as if we had cooties and he was afraid we'd give to it to him. \u00a0This is literally what he said, \"I heard there was an unfortunate incident regarding one of your dishes. My apologies. I will remove it from your tab.\" That was while he was swiftly backing away. It was the most insincere and abrupt apology I've ever received from a business owner/manager ever! He said his piece and scurried off. I'd call that a record drive by apology of 5 seconds.  To add to the unsatisfactory service, they took one of our plates with that hairy tartar and did not replace it. I had to ask for it after more food kept coming out because I guess our waitress didn't realize we were missing a plate. Not her fault since she didn't take the plate away. But still, someone should have noticed.   When the bill came, the ahi tuna tartar was still on the bill.... The waitress realized it before we said anything so good for her because I would have said something.   I probably would come back just for the chicken. Everything else I can probably find at another restaurant with ease. The service was pretty good until the \"unfortunate incident\" happened. It was the manager's handling of the problem that really killed the experience for me. I'm sure your experience won't be as bad as long as you avoid hairy foods.",

Sleek, simple, with clean lines, good natural light and lots of wood.  We sat at the bar ordering drinks and a snack. He went with a beer and I a play on a margarita with a chile.* Our bartender was a doll; I'm not really one for small talk, but we chatted with her easily while we were there. To eat, we ordered the Early Morning Tomatoes. The description was a little deceptive, we thought we'd be getting a flatbread, but it was more like a tomato salad with flatbread croutons. We loved the dish but agreed that more chevre would have improved it.  If the rest of Fog City's food is like the drinks and appetizer we had, it's worth a stop. I'd definitely make a stop in again if I was on the Embarcadero.  * The chile that comes with this drink may be small, but the manfriend ate it and it is hot. Have something to blunt the heat at the ready, it is h-o-t, hot.",

The waiter, about 65, full gray hair, 5'8\" high, 230lb stocky, big nose, dominator idiot, giving us a lecture of the menu, telling us what he likes or not. His mouth smelled so bad like rotten Tofu like, or I must say, 17 days old mackerel. \u00a0He was very rude to us. Such a self centered character that he thinks he is better than anybody, the kind. Who the hell cares for your opinion?  Just get me a food, Bitch!  Well, also, the most of food was underwhelming. We had the crab cakes, which were tasty but small. OK, they were on the menu as a 'small plate', but at $16 they were very disappointing.  My friend had the chicken salad which was $17--extortionate, considering it was brown chicken meat and lettuce with a minimal amount of all the other ingredients (Tory Farm Nectarines, Marinated Cabbage, Candied Peanuts). Personally, I find it BAFFLING how restaurants can charge such high prices for what is, essentially, 10 cents worth of lettuce and less chicken than you get in a single chicken tender from KFC. Ridiculous.  You pay $15 for a shitty burger that doesn't even come with fries. The bun was soggy. The lettuce was sparse. The meat didn't really taste like anything and was a thin patty. Man. I got through about 3 bites and called it quits.  Overall, 'meh' is a great word to describe Fog City. It's a shame, because it could be more upbeat, be much better value for money and have more personality/individuality. But being where it is (right near the Pier buildings and near a constant stream of tourist traffic) the owners probably don't think they need to bother making any extra effort.  I don't like the dominator waiter. I feel really sorry for him. What a Frustrated Ugly Old Fart!  Cherylynn N. For my review of: Fog City \"Well, I guess I know what to skip!\"  Yes, you should Skip Fog City!",

The food here is all family style, though some of the dishes might come out smaller than the others and some are a little more massive. \u00a0There was 6 of us for the evening and here's what we ordered: \u00a0  Snacks:  - Hand-cut Furikake Fries Garlic Aioli - Brussels Sprouts Asian Pears Ponzu (This does come with fish flakes, those ones you find on takoyaki, so veggies beware)  Veggies: - King Oyster Mushrooms  Seafood:  - Kampachi Crudo (this was definitely on the smaller side) - Wood Oven Clams  Meats:  - Wood Oven Whole Chicken (we got 2 of these) - Berkshire Pork Cheeks  Everything was pretty delicious. \u00a0Highlights were definitely the meats. \u00a0The Pork Cheeks were super soft and just melts in your mouth delicious. \u00a0And the Whole Chicken!!! I couldn't rave more about them. \u00a0Its boneless and so juicy and tender, it puts any and all other roasted chicken you've had to SHAME! \u00a0If there's only 1 thing you would order here, FOR GODS SAKE ORDER THE CHICKEN!!! It is so good.  This place also has an amazing bar with a great range of whiskeys and cocktails. \u00a0But most importantly mocktails for the littlies or designated driver.   This place is also kid friendly and is large enough to easily accommodate for large groups. \u00a0Though make sure you book ahead. \u00a0This place gets very busy and would be hard to get seats without a booking.   Oh yeah and order the chicken!",

I was okay with that. I ordered the burger. It was juicy and yummy and the bun was not soggy at all. My husband ordered the smoked salmon smorrebrod. \u00a0He really enjoyed it. We didn't care for the hand cut furikake fries. They were just all right. When we first placed our ordered, we ordered 4 dishes (burger, salmon, fries and their brussels sprouts).I was a bit disappointed that all our food came and by the time my burger, my brussel sprouts finally came. Keep in mind, there was a family a table over that orderd after us and they received their brussel sprouts before me. That was a bit let down for me. Will I go again? Probably not. It was okay. I can say I finally went after their remodel.",

Graham's original to shame - a bubbling pot of creamy Mornay smothering tangy sourdough and smoked turkey with a crown of crisp bacon and lightly griddled tomatoes added straight from the pan. \u00a0Clearly unwilling to pass on dessert it was with a small menu of frozen custards, crullers, and shortcake that I was presented and although the later featured the strawberry finale I desired so did the brunch menu French Toast, a buttery trio of triangles so saturated with maple-infused custard that the interior was nearly liquid beneath a crunchy golden coat ready to be dressed in even more maple, whipped cream, and lightly reduced berries that made me wonder not only why more has not been said of this dish but why anyone would sell themselves short with the shortcake.",

A perfect hamburger unique to how I ever had it and a bonus of a Stoli O with 7. Yum. So of course the next time I came to SF I was so looking forward to recreate. And then the big disappointment that it had closed down. Today by chance I drove by and to my delight, they're back!! \u00a0I couldn't wait for my perfect cheeseburger. DONT BE FOOLED BY THE NAME DINER. \u00a0This is by no means a diner. I say they revamped into a swanky hip chic loud restaurant. Really not a place my kids would like. In fact I found it hard to find anything other than a hamburger that I would order. I wasn't ready for duck at a \"diner\".   Well here's the sad fact. The burger, well, umm..I didn't enjoy it at all. I've had better at 5 guys or even sonic. Nothing special. I feel bad that a place I once revered is now nothing but a memory. Perhaps if I have a different mindset going in and want to not have a conversation with my company, I'll try it again. Just maybe but not likely. ,",

I also think Fog City in general is a pretty good deal for the portion size. \u00a0The whole roast chicken is only $34 compared to Zuni's $48. \u00a0The butter lettuce salad served 2 generously and could have served 3 or 4 adequately for around $10. \u00a0$7 for \"snacks,\" like the rich, slightly tangy deviled eggs or brussels sprouts seems totally fair to me since most are healthy sized and require thought and consistent preparation.

Strange to begin with...but then we sat there with our burger in front of us for 15 minutes being polite before my brothers entree came! We complained to our waiter since our burger was cold at that point and he said, \"oh, you're meant to share\". Hmm ok. So you want me to slice a burger into thirds at the table and share it?! Weird.

    "review_text": "I visited Fog City on Sunday, October 13th, for the first time since the renovation. I had been to the original Fog City Diner (or, as \u00a0Phil Frank put it, the \"Fog City Dumpster\" :-D unfortunately, those \"Farley\" comics which used to hang prominently on the wall near the bathrooms are no longer there) a few times and absolutely loved the ambiance and the food. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the revamped Fog City. I admit that this review is in part jaded by my instinctual comparisons between Fog City and the Fog City Diner, but perhaps it will still help someone.   First, the ambiance. I'm old-fashioned and loved the Art Deco look that the original Fog City Diner had. I knew that the interior had been remodeled, but even still, I was disappointed to find how radically different it was. I would use the word \"trendy\" to describe the interior now...the look may age well and it may not, but it felt like any other \"modern upscale\" restaurant that I've set foot into. Again, I really liked the charm of the old Diner, so your experience may be different, but I found the new look to be bland, unoriginal, and unimpressive. Also, while this may have been in part because the place was fairly busy, I got the impression from the gentleman at the front desk that, as a single diner, I was tolerated rather than welcomed. At the same time, the waiter treated me very well. It's also worth noting that the place was very noisy, with people packed very close to one another...as a single diner who generally likes to concentrate on a good book while eating, I didn't like this, but this could be a positive point for some.  Now, to the meat of the matter...the food. I'm about one of the most predictable people you'll ever meet; if it's available, I'm ordering a plain cheeseburger and fries (and, if it's not available, I'm usually not eating at that restaurant). After placing my order, the food came surprisingly quickly. The fries were good for the most part...nice and crispy, and the seasoning was okay, although there was something in the topping that almost tasted fishy; I can't really put my finger on what it was. The burger, however, was a bit of a disappointment. I wouldn't say that it was bad, but for the price, I expected something more. I think the kitchen changed their source of beef; I was impressed by the burger at the old Fog City Diner, and I'll admit that that expectation may be part of the source of my disappointment. But, the beef was all but tasteless, and seemed to be swimming in the cheese.  Finally, I should say something about the price. The menu listed the burger at $14, which isn't unreasonable. However, I was surprised when I received the check and found that the fries were a separate menu entry, for $6! I had assumed that the fries came with the burger; that's my fault for not double-checking...but, what used to cost maybe $18 is now pushing $30, for what most would consider a fairly basic meal. Note that that price doesn't include a drink; I generally only drink water (teetotaler and I don't like soda). Given that, and that my food orders are generally less expensive than that of others, I think rating this restaurant a \"3\" on the Price Range is more than fair.  In conclusion, while the waiter did a great job, I was underwhelmed by the front desk, and while the food was not awful, I don't think it was a good value at that price. So, especially considering how many options there are in the immediate area, I regret to say that I don't think I'll be returning to the place that used to be my favorite spot to eat in San Francisco. I imagine that there are many who love the revamp, but I'd really like to see the return of the original Fog City Diner!",

It's that it's been more than six months since my last incident, and I regret the discrimination experienced at a restaurant at which I used to LOVE to dine.   Imane served my husband and me a delicious meal of Eggs Benny. However, our enjoyment was tarnished by the apparent racism in the initial seating, and for that reason, we will not be returning. Although first in line when the restaurant opened this morning, we were walked to table #28, the one right in front of the register with a poor view, foot traffic, and inevitable endless conversation by the staff that gather there. The restaurant was not remotely full (and wasn't when we finally left), but when we asked to be reseated to a similar table two chairs away, the gentleman who seated us said, \"I'll have to check. The host assigned this table specifically.\" As he walked away, a White couple who asked to be reseated out of the same section was immediately offered a booth, no one checking with the host first. We indeed received a new table (not a booth), and soon thereafter two Black women were relegated to the table we just vacated, suffering the same push back when asking to be reseated: \"I'll have to check.\" They were offered the booth by the door, a slightly better but by no means top choice location.  I hope that in the future, not only will the worst tables in the restaurant be reserved for final seating when Fog City actually is full, but also that there is more sensitivity to patterns of behavior such that they might be self-regulated. Diversity or anti-bias training perhaps?  I used to enjoy Fog City Diner every other weekend when I lived in San Francisco and never experienced such indignity. I hope service can return to those days ... although I won't be returning to find out.",

Unfortunately nothing left of the original menu and lack luster of \"entries\" I don't think you can call $15 burger that looks like it came from Carl's Jr. a meal. Sadden by this what was a restaurant visited for more than 5+ years will not have our business again. Quick tip: If it's not broken don't fix it. Maybe it's a new owner and trying to follow in footsteps of other restaurants around but the sad part it's no longer original.",

    "review_text": "Oh my, I can still remember when this place was called Mildred Pierce's way back when I was a poor assistant media planner in an ad agency near the Levi Plaza. I believe that was sometime after Pearl Harbor and before my last memory lapse. Then it became Battery Point for a minute and then changed identities again around the mid-80's to Fog City Diner. Believe it or not, it used to be a trendy place to go, although the retro-diner vibe became so commonplace and the menu so misbegotten with its festering Mexican and Asian small plate selections, that it finally sputtered into oblivion last year. I don't think I even made it over there in over a decade, and even in its new guise, I was hesitant to go until a food blogger raved about how good the food was.  Fog City? Really? Chef/owner Bruce Hill has indeed dropped the Diner part of the moniker and now it's simply Fog City. The place looks much more sleek and contemporary with dark wood accents but still with the windows facing the splintered traffic flows from Battery and the Embarcadero. The horseshoe bar is most inviting, but Jamie W. and I were here with another couple to see if Michael Bauer's enthusiasm was justified. I started with a refreshing cocktail, the $10 Daredevil, a tantalizing, old-school mix of Campari, ginger beer and lemon (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1yTKg0b&amp;s=06cd1c07f529594158d0c348094289c7800e4db42095ac98721982c384d84a59\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1yTKg0b</a>). We then shared a couple of no-risk options - the $7 Blistered Summer Peppers (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1AtUgjs&amp;s=4405686d55b5eb94a671d71115d39a425f96e7cce5b3e3fd76c917274f261200\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1AtUgjs</a>) and the $8 Deviled Eggs (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FXwKlf8&amp;s=8447a00f21712fb5d823c96413cdea5eab16a74a6323a98dcd2b61b57b726e3e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/XwKlf8</a>).  The peppers were mostly shishito and nicely roasted, while the quartet of egg halves were filled with yolks richly creamed with grain mustard and topped with crispy quinoa beads and a shard of bacon. Both starters gave a clear indication that the Fog was back, and it was full steam ahead. Entrees were all quite good, but two really stood out. Luckily I ordered the best one, the $35 Wood Oven Whole Chicken, which had me initially hesitant that the portion was too big. Alas, leftover chicken at home is fine by me, so I proceeded with the humongous, butterflied poultry that was laid before me in a piping-hot cast-iron skillet. It was in good company with whole fingerling potatoes, lightly smashed and heavily buttered, along with Brentwood corn on the cob, crisp bacon bits, kimchi butter, spiced salt and mixed greens (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1uQoX1X&amp;s=72aafd8ca4bcb7311f78f005ece85c8649e550dbac953baee9c6124ef4a6986a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1uQoX1X</a>).  The chicken was moist and tender with the skin crisped and smoked to an ideal state. It's almost as good as the roast chicken at Zuni Cafe, and you don't have to wait quite as long. Second prize went to the $31 Oak Grilled Pork Chop, quite a hefty, juicy bone-in slice that sat on top of sweet corn polenta, spicy collard greens and farmers' market stone fruit chutney (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1rQRJKS&amp;s=defdd22b6ff845abdfa63a89a6c9f75659f685d7669e6e60627cdae027ecdbfa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1rQRJKS</a>). Richly delicious. It was inevitable that the other two dishes paled by comparison. The $25 Wood Grilled Swordfish was tender, seasoned well and pleasing as it was nestled on top of a bed of roasted vegetables (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1pDqNzE&amp;s=9539d0a96ec4b805e81c6f731f1a73806fcd17c5b5f37cd72d32c0e95984cf2e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1pDqNzE</a>), but overall it was a bit bland and vanilla in execution. The same could be said for the $19 Spice Roasted Wild Boar Ribs.  They were a bit arid-tasting with just a dry rub seasoning and rather lonely with only the pickled celery, jalape\u00f1o, carrot and honey slaw to keep them company (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1mfNF3J&amp;s=9ee90d9cd5a02acab59db100dbc684e3d1c5bf59ac59549df54ee733c4eb7799\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1mfNF3J</a>). All of us were moving gradually into belt-loosening mode, but we knew we had to try at least a couple of their desserts. First up was their signature $6 Fog City Frozen Custard made with Straus Dairy cream. Tahitian vanilla bean was the flavor of choice and it came on top of a glazed French cruller with a dark chocolate sauce for an extra $2. But the winner was the $8 Strawberry Shortcake, a creamed biscuit topped with seascape strawberries and brown sugar-infused whipped cream (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FVBlNzr&amp;s=d77eb04f3a38be336034881aa30a987d188231a30264891acf9e99f1a4736908\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/VBlNzr</a>). OK we're done now. Full. The Fog has lifted back to its original state of culinary grace.  FOOD - 4 stars...back-to-basics American done up with flair with the whole chicken a major standout AMBIANCE - 4 stars...much more chic and relaxing than its previous iterations with roomy booths and scenic city scene views SERVICE - 3.5 stars...much more cordial than they were in the Diner days TOTAL - 4 stars...reinvented American bistro proves you can go home again",

My only (mild) complaint is that I wish they had a slightly larger brunch selection, but I can't even be upset about their limited menu since everything I've had from it (and they change it semi-regularly, it seems) has been incredible.  So yeah... Fog City Diner is incredible, and if you can manage it, ask to be seated in Mario's section. \u00a0He'll make the experience even better.",

Service was great and decor of restaurant was upgraded nicely was a bar in the middle and open window all around which brighten up the earthly feel of the place . Some items on the menu I feel was on the pricer side maybe due to the tourist attraction nearby .  Location : 2 blocks away from exploratorium ..   My friend made RSVP for 11:30 right when they opened so the place was pretty empty, even for Saturday morning brunch. The table was ready and set up for three of us next to the window looking out to the street ..u may request for table looking out to the Pier but there not much to see other than the new construction site on the pier.  Food:  Hand-cut Furikake Fries, Garlic Aioli \u00a0 Original with a Japanese twist .. With flakes of seaweeds and Bonita. Liked.  F O G \u00a0C I T Y \u00a0Burger: my friend ordered it.. She enjoyed it .. Nothing extraordinary, but good juicy Burger .  The Spaceman : an non- alcoholic drink with Pomegranate, Lime, Honey, Tonic.. It was a pretty and sizzling drink . But I thought it was a bit pricy 6$ for non alcohol drink.  Panorama Bread: come in 3 piece.. It sourdough bread .. crispy on the outside and soft inside but for a \u00a0hip and modern restaurant I would expect it to be complimentary instead of charging 3$ for each piece.  F O G \u00a0C I T Y \u00a0Hot Brown 18$  House Roasted Heritage Turkey, Pt Reyes Cheddar Mornay Sauce, Crisp Bacon, Roma Tomatoes, Openface on Sourdough Bread.. I just thought it was A -ok.. Didn't have too much flavoring.. Tomatoe was rather bland..And turkey was rather dry. Beacon was only piece I enjoyed of the whole dish . \u00a0Would ask them for some hot sauce to add a kick to it .   Service was 5 stars .. Friendly waitress and often come back to check on us . And we did not felt rushed even though we sat there for almost 2 hours .",

I'm very happy with the remodel of the space. \u00a0Yes, the old building was very cutting edge for its day, but it was really showing its age. \u00a0Plus the interior was very dark and not particularly inviting. \u00a0I remember people referring to getting a table on the Embarcadero side of the building as being in Siberia.  The new space is very open. \u00a0They took out the wall in the middle and opened up the Embarcadero side of the building with larger windows. \u00a0Once the America's cup structures are removed, that side of building will have a nice view of the bay.  I'd describe the decor as \"industrial chic.\" \u00a0Clean and modern but comfortable.  We've eaten here four times now and have enjoyed everything we've eaten. \u00a0Even though they have \"classic\" items on their menu such as french fries and deviled eggs, they are done with a slightly different flair. \u00a0Their fries are served with Furikake and the eggs with quinoa and bacon. \u00a0Not perhaps what you might expect, but most enjoyable. \u00a0The pickles are wonderful!  For entrees we've tried the burger, pork cheeks, chicken, lamb and ribeye. \u00a0All were excellent. \u00a0Big enough to share if you'd care to. \u00a0I will say, however, that the pork cheeks are exceptionally rich. \u00a0We had it on our first \"official\" visit when we went a bit overboard with our ordering and it was just a bit too much on top of three appetizers and two vegetable courses prior.  For dessert, we've tried the frozen custard, crullers and panna cotta pudding cake. \u00a0All were amazing, but the crullers are transcendent.  We found the service to be excellent. \u00a0All of the staff we've met so far have been very friendly and helpful.  I'm not a drinker, but according to the SO, the bar does a great job.  As an aside, the SO dropped by for lunch within the past week without a reservation and although there was a bit of a wait, was accommodated within a reasonable amount of time.  We'll be back.",

Sometimes it would be a little too dry, or too salty and saucy, or it felt like the chef forgot an ingredient. It was displeasing.   We still had a great time nonetheless.

The food, in general, was good, fresh, and healthy, but what ruined the experience was the poor service.   After being seated, we didn't see our waiter for at least 10 minutes and our drinks for another 10 minutes. My wife and I both ordered the salmon which I thought was delicious but proved to be somewhat undercooked for her. When she told the waiter it was too raw for her, rather than offer to take it back to the kitchen and put it under the broiler for another 2-3 minutes, he questioned her taste and told her that this was how the restaurant prepares the dish.   Once he finally took it back to the kitchen for some further preparation, we didn't see him again for another 10 minutes by which time the salmon was cooked but cold, I had already finished my meal, and our mood had darkened. \u00a0What we hoped would be a nice dinner turned into a real disappointment.   The food at Fog City Diner was good and there were lots of attractive dishes to choose from. But our waiter seemed overtaxed with too many tables to service, and once there was a little problem, he became irritated and his attitude became really poor. \u00a0  Maybe we'll try it again in 15 years.",

Having earned his chops at Stars, Aqua, Oritalia, and Waterfront Restaurant, Chef Bruce Hill offers a menu based on live fire cooking and fresh, local ingredients. \u00a0 Deviled eggs ($6) with crispy quinoa and bacon are a great starter. \u00a0Served on a house-made bun with smoked tomato aioli, American cheese, tomato, onion, and bread and butter pickles, the Fog City burger ($14) is a contender for the top ten (OK, maybe 20) burgers in The City. \u00a0Served with charred Brentwood corn and crispy potatoes and topped with spiced Maldon salt, the whole wood oven roasted chicken ($24) was good, but not up to the level of Zuni Caf\u00e9. \u00a0The French fries ($6) with furikake seasoning and garlic aioli were undercooked and limp--a disappointing side note to an otherwise solid performance.  There is an ever-changing selection of 16 wines on tap, as well as an extensive list of wines by the bottle. With seven beers on tap and numerous other offerings by the bottle, the beer program features artisanal selections, from both local and national breweries.  Service was friendly and well-meaning, but a little off. \u00a0Courses were not well paced: entr\u00e9es arrived before appetizers were finished, and servers were sometimes absent for extended periods.

The oysters were not very meaty but the flavors of the mignonette complemented them perfectly. We decided that the winning main course was the hot brown. And boy was it hot!!! Scolding hot! The $17 chicken soup was great but the roasted brussels sprouts took over the flavor. I would have called it Brussels sprout soup. Two of us got the burger and both loved it. The bun should have been warmed. They said the burger is served medium. But we both agreed it was medium rare. My friend likes it medium rare so that was perfect for him. Our waiter Adam had the patience of a saint.",

Drinks: \u00a0The handcrafted cocktail menu has something for everyone and the wine list has great options as well. \u00a0  Food: \u00a0The small plate menu changes with the seasons, which helps to keep the menu fresh for frequent visitors like me! There are some great snack options like paprika peanuts, farm beets, deviled eggs, and calamari. \u00a0The dinner menu has great options too. \u00a0My favorite dinners have been the burger and the short ribs. \u00a0Brunch options are available on Saturday and Sunday beginning at 11:30 a.m. \u00a0I hope to be back soon to try brunch!",

I love the redesigned layout of the space. Its cozy and inviting. Love the smell of the wood fired oven as you walk in the door. Everything is open including the kitchen. And its nice to see the city moving by out the large windows.  They have several wines by the glass available on tap. The prices are nice range of \"something for everyone\" in style and price. I didn't have a cocktail, but the list looked pretty inviting.  We ordered the butter lettuce salad with a smoky green goddess dressing. Plenty for two of us to share. It was a very tasty salad. I'd like to put it up against the green goddess salad at Wayfare Tavern. Not sure who would win that fight.  Shared some brussels sprouts with asian pear and ponzu that had been fired in the wood oven. Must confess they didn't last very long. Can't wait to have them again soon.  For the main course we shared the pork cheeks with romano beans and polenta. Pork cheeks were fork tender and just crispy on the edges with a delicate sauce that didn't overpower a thing. Pure heaven in this dish. Creamy crispy fresh and plenty for two to share.  I had read amazing things about the dessert so we ordered the crullers and the frozen custard with egg yolk caramel. I was transported back to college days of a shop that served hot doughnuts to hungry students in the midwest. Only Fog City's had the most lovely orange scented glaze. Fresh, hot and light yet crispy.   The frozen custard was delivered as \u00a0scoop in a dish, with a tiny pitcher of caramel on the side. Their salty rich creamy caramel paired with rich frozen custard is pretty hard to beat. Even better when you dip your cruller into each item.  The service was very warm and inviting. I can't wait to go back for another visit. We officially have a new neighborhood favorite!",

Not to mention, I always sat in the booth that was featured in my favorite movie \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\" featuring Mike Myers; this EASILY was my favorite diner in all San Francisco. But I have to say this last time after the remodeling/re-opening.... It went downhill. I felt like everything tasted the same: like it was drenched in the same vat of uncomplimentary spices... I know they have to compete with other trendy businesses... But they couldn't keep ONE thing from the previous menu?? Not even the seafood salad?? And I have to say... The lamb kabobs: don't waste your time with these. They're not authentic. They don't really taste that great at all....  I do have to say I liked the Brussel sprouts... And the deviled eggs were... Alright. Not epic.  Now. Another thing: WE WERE SNUBBED. BY THE FREAKING MA\u00ceTRE DE. And our waitress wasn't gonna win the Miss Congeniality title anytime soon.  I'm sorry to say that, unless they lower the prices on the sub-par food (or create a better menu!), the staff check their attitudes, and they bring back a hint of the old place, we won't be going back any time soon.

So, we were really looking forward to having brunch at the recently reopened Fog City. Our interpretation of brunch is that there are lunch dishes along with several egg dishes on the menu. However, this was not the case. There was one egg dish (eggs benny). Having had many great burgers at the original diner, my husband thought that he couldn't go wrong by ordering the Fog City Cheese Burger. It was nothing like the juicy thick burgers that good SF restaurants serve. The patty was about \u00bc\" thick with the rest of the bun being taken up with onions and chopped lettuce. Definitely not worth $14, especially when you can go to The Burritt Tavern and get a great burger for a bit less. I had a dish called the Fog City Hot Brown (turkey, Mornay sauce, tomatoes on rye) for $16. It wasn't horrible, but it was very boring, with the sauce overpowering any other taste. A strip of bacon was put on top even though it wasn't on the menu, maybe to try to add taste. Anyway, there's not much positive that I can say about the food or the ambience of the new Fog City.",

    "review_text": "Went there last night for their Grand Opening. The overall d\u00e9cor and makeover is lovely! The design of the new location gives it a fresh and crisp look. The chairs were comfortable and the lighting was just right. I was a little disappointed by the menu since I called to make a reservation and asked how the menu has changed and was told that the chef has changed and that the food is more refined but that some of the elements from the previous restaurant were kept. We were a table of 3 and all of us felt that the menu was lacking those comforting elements it used to have in the past. Since we had a fish allergy in our table the menu was very limited and we all felt that it was hard to choose.  I must say that the items we did choose were all well prepared. We started off with the pickles which reminded me of my grandma's pickles. They were great however the portion was a little too small. We then had the Fries. The aioli that came with the fries was wonderful. We also ordered the girl tomato salad which was wonderful. I think that out of everything we ordered I enjoyed this dish the most. The tapenade dressing was salty and creamy at the right texture. There was just enough of it in the salad.  We also ordered a side of bread and the bread was hot and really hard to cut in portions. We ended up having to tear it apart with our hands since we couldn't slice it appropriately. All three of us had the hamburger prepared to different degrees of doneness. The one thing which is hard to do is share a hamburger so I would think it's not a sharable item and would not present it as such. The homemade bun, although good in flavor was too thin and the aioli on the bottom made it soggy and impossible to eat as a hamburger. I had to use a knife and fork to dismantle my burger... The burger flavor was really good and the pickles that went with it gave it a sweeter flavor which was interesting. We were excited about the desserts and ordered the frozen custard, the curled donuts and the pana cotta chocolate caramel cake. The frozen custard had a great texture but we did not care so much for the dark chocolate sauce that came with it. It had a processed flavor to it. The chocolate sauce did help the donuts a lot. I like the presentation of the donuts and thought it was a nice way to present something so simple. The donuts themselves were nice and fluffy but a sauce on the side to accompany it would really help. (we used the sauce that came with the custard) The highlight of the desserts was by far the pana cotta chocolate caramel cake. The mixture of flavors, the saltiness of the cake and the caramel were so complimentary to one another. Overall an ok experience. Good food execution. A few comments on the side:  We found that the menu was vague in description. 2 of the 3 people in our group are restaurant people (work in kitchens) and the descriptions were so hard to understand that we had to ask a lot of questions. Unfortunately, our waiter tried unsuccessfully to answer those questions for us but had a really hard time describing them in any other way.  With regards to the dessert menu we found that the frozen custard was not clear on how it really worked out and how it was presented.  The curly donuts also had a weird description for them and that was not something we were clear about either. The pana cotta also had these key words but it wasn't clear how a cake and pana cotta were combined into a dessert together. The waiter did manage to describe this dish in a good manner. We all know that yesterday was opening night. We are giving this feedback in the hope that some of our comments will be heard and hopefully dealt with so that we can continue coming to this establishment many more times in the future. The restaurant does have tremendous potential and we will definitely give it another shot in a few months.",

While my wife and I loved going to the original Fog City Diner, I was a bit skeptical of the new (updated) restaurant. \u00a0I was not disappointed!  The food is absolutely magnificent, superlative, and does not merit any criticism of the menu items I've tried thus far. \u00a0Every patron that I've seen in the restaurant enjoyed the food and themselves immensely.  The wines, beer and cocktails were excellent: if you are not a oenophile, \u00a0I highly recommend asking your server to suggest or recommend a wine to be paired with your entree. \u00a0Their wines are excellent and unlike most restaurants, where getting wine by the glass most often has little to recommend, this is one place where I would heartily recommend ordering wine by the glass if you so choose.  The service was excellent and so was the staff, who I found to be genuinely very personable -- and not just to earn a large gratuity. \u00a0They have all been delightfully helpful, gracious, delightfully patient (the restaurant was packed; there was a long wait for a table, people were hungry and the time between ordering and being served was, as you might expect, proportional for the number of people seated, yet both our server and host stopped by the table to see if we could be served in any way as we sat waiting). \u00a0I've always brought my closest friends, associates, and professional colleagues here without the slightest hesitation (despite language challenges of many of my foreign colleagues). \u00a0  Every item on the menu is well-worth trying. \u00a0For those who are new to the restaurant, I highly recommend asking the host or your server to make a recommendation for your lunch or dinner, and -- by all means -- ask for their recommendation of a wine to pair with your entree. \u00a0There has only been one person who did not know which wine he'd recommend and asked another server to suggest a wine for me: I deeply appreciated their honesty and candor.  (I travel an average of 318 days a year to 79 different countries, and dine out approximately 350 days a year. \u00a0I enjoy passing my impressions of restaurants' food, wines, service, and value to my friends. \u00a0Fog City is one of my favorite restaurants, and one that I love bringing family, friends, visitors, and professional colleagues here, for the food is that good.)  Last of all: a patron, in a review, made comment about being treated poorly on the basis of race. \u00a0I wouldn't tolerate this for a New York second, personally or professionally. \u00a0In the 26 years I've been a guest at Fog City Diner, to include the new Fog City restaurant, I have never seen even the slightest suggestion of racism on the part of any restaurant employee. \u00a0(As I have been employed by airlines, I would never tolerate such treatment even if I observed it in dealings of the staff with other customers and would never risk bring a professional colleague to this restaurant if I ever had a question or concern about racism.) \u00a0After reading the one negative review which cited racism in their experience, having patronized this restaurant an average of perhaps twice monthly over the better part of 25 years, I've never experienced, observed, or been told of such an allegation -- and question why the individuals involved didn't seek out the manager or owner, if they felt so strongly about their alleged treatment to include an allegation of racism in a review.",

We had a reservation: waited 20 minutes for a table. Service: waited over an hour for the food after we had purposely pre-ordered the chicken while waiting for our table because we were told it would take 35 minutes. Waitress was snotty and condescending, telling us how the chef recommends we order each dish (yes I get that the steak should be cooked med-rare but let's not have an argument with my boyfriend about ordering it med-well.) Food: mediocre at best. Chicken was dry. $39 steak was ok but 1/3 fat. Everything was bland. Nothing special here. Management: once we complained about our food taking so long the manager was barely concerned and seemed to hover around our table afterward hoping we would leave. We were completely rushed through our meal and suddenly had 3 bussers constantly trying to clear plates. My son's desert wasn't even comped! Bottom line: I'm a disgruntled native San Franciscan that is continuously disappointed in what this town has become. Fog City Diner used to be a place where you could have a good meal with your family. There are hardly any places like that anymore. But that's another tangent. Warning on this douchey restaurant. Spend your money somewhere else.",

Then I get asked if I want fries, OK I guess you get a choice of fries or salad? Up comes my burger, pattie looks a little small and it's VERY rare, I don't mind that but many don't and would have had to send it back. Tastes OK but how hard is it to f*ck a burger up? I finish my meal and ask for the check, are you kidding me! The burger was $14, but wait the fries were an extra $6!!! Tax and tip see me coughing up $26.40 for a very average burger and fires.

We live close by and have eaten often at the diner version over the years. \u00a0The last few times have been a shadow of their Glory years and I am happy that this new version is here to reclaim their reputation.",

I found it on yelp as a good spot for brunch near our Fisherman's Wharf hotel. (Aren't we trendy). I decided we need good cocktails at brunch obviously.   First off this place is gorgeous. I mean stunningly pretty. Open kitchen, low booths, huge windows. We got stuffed in the back(Hungover, Hungry, guys in sports apparel don't deserve to sit where decent members of society can see them) and still had a nice view.  We popped in around 11 for some brunch. Dressed head to toe in Husky Gear, hungover, we looked slightly out of place. The wait staff didn't bat an eye, we were kindly addressed, seated, and served. Our waitress even put up with our lame attempts to flirt and be funny with a smile and occasional laugh. Service was excellent, she even let our most hungover patron order a grilled cheese off of the kids menu.  The cocktails were superb, I had the \"Inside Job\", a little rye for spice, ginger for the stomach, and lemon to wake you up. The Furikake Fries were mind blowing the fries were perfectly cooked the aioli was spot on and the furikake was a genius addition. I had the \"Hot brown\" as my entree. Everything was delicious but the dish lacked cohesiveness which I would blame on the composition. Nothing crumbling the bacon wouldn't fix.  I'll be back for the fries and cocktails without a doubt.",

    "review_text": "Really disappointing. What ISN'T wrong with this place?  I really expected a lot better from this well-known restaurant group reopening such an iconic San Francisco restaurant. Sadly, it seems someone there must think their fine reputation puts them above basic customer service.  Had New Years Day late lunch here today and, ok, it was New Years Day, so maybe management didn't staff for a HOLIDAY (?!) or somebody didn't show up for their shift...but the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, maybe half full, so why such a mess?  The service was a completed disaster - like I said, maybe they were understaffed or hung-over and movin' slow. Once we were seated, it took ten minutes for someone to come by and offer us water. We could see there were only two or three servers working the floor so decided what we wanted quickly and ordered from the server when she brought our water since it was clear we might not see her again for awhile.  I ordered the burger and asked for it medium-well, the server paused for a moment and answered \"We can cook it medium OR well.\" **Um, really?** You can't cook a burger the way your guest prefers it? For a $14 burger (sans fries, which are another $7!!) you'd think they could cook it to order. Apparently not.  We ordered a kale salad that never arrived, so when the server brought the check I reminded her that and asked if it had been removed from the check. She responded yes, and that it was her fault, \"I just didn't key it in.\" OMG.  It took 20 minutes for our iced teas to arrive and forty minutes for our food to come. About 10 minutes after we got our food (delivered by a different server, which made me think there is some sort of a service gap in doing it this way) our original server came by to ask if everything was ok. The water carafe on our table was empty, so I asked if we could have more water. She said yes, \"In a minute.\" Wha??   I watched a group of guys sitting adjacent to us as their food came sporadically and having some issue with not getting what they ordered. )-:  Food was pretty good (and came to our table hot!) \u00a0but COMPLETELY overshadowed by the totally frustrating service and steep prices.   So many great restaurants in SF, spend your precious time and money at those, not here.",

The kitchen is open, so you can see the chefs at work, but there's not the sizzle that you get in other open kitchens. There doesn't seem to be much energy about the place at all. Service wasn't slow, exactly. There just wasn't any gusto, you know?  Most of the food was underwhelming. I had the crab cakes, which were tasty but small. OK, they were on the menu as a 'small plate', but at $16 they were disappointing. My fiance had the chicken salad which was $17--extortionate, considering it was brown chicken meat and lettuce with a minimal amount of all the other ingredients (Tory Farm Nectarines, Marinated Cabbage, Candied Peanuts). Personally, I find it BAFFLING how restaurants can charge such high prices for what is, essentially, 10 cents worth of lettuce and less chicken than you get in a single chicken tender from KFC. Ridiculous.  Overall, 'meh' is a great word to describe Fog City. It's a shame, because it could be more upbeat, be \u00a0much better value for money and have more personality/individuality. But being where it is (right near the Pier buildings and near a constant stream of tourist traffic) the owners probably don't think they need to bother making any extra effort.",

The old menu was a lot more extensive but I can appreciate with what they are trying to do with this revamped version. My only complaint is that while the old Fog City diner was unique and a hangout for SF elites, the new Fog city is very trendy and hipsterish and I can name at least 10 restaurants in the city just like it.   That being said, the bar is absolutely beautiful. The drinks are superb and the food, while simple, is certainty not pedestrian. Last time I had a beet salad and fried artichokes. I've also tried a very delicious kale salad, hamachi, the made to order doughnuts and a pudding dessert. They also have great ice cream. The menu changes pretty regularly, which I love. The bread and butter is also a very welcoming side of warm goodness. The service is spot on and the space is stunning with obvious attention to detail.

If you seeking a cool, unpretentious spot to power-lunch, look no further than this restaurant (which is conveniently located along the intersection of the Embarcadero and Levi Plaza). Added bonus: there's plenty of street parking + nearby parking lots!  My friends and I went to town with the lunch menu. The three of us split their famous deviled eggs (topped with crusted quinoa and bacon), as well as their new cherry tomato salad (which comes with lettuce, bacon, crumbled blue cheese/dressing). Once we finished devouring our small plates, we graduated to our main course. One of my friends got the burger (which is like a gourmet version of an In n Out burger) coupled with some crispy fries. My other friend went the more healthy route and ordered the kale salad with nuts, Spring veggies, watermelon radish, Persian cucumbers, and citrus vinaigrette. I, on the other hand, opted for the Saigon Dip (a Vietnamese inspired sandwich made with shaved roasted pork, spicy pickled vegetables, chili aioli, and cilantro). And to top it all off, the sandwich came with a large Pho dipping broth. It was as if a Vietnamese Banh mi and a French Dip came together and had a delicious love child. So good! I'm still flossing the roasted pork from my teeth.  For dessert, we split the house-made Frozen Custard. Admittedly, I don't have the biggest sweet tooth in the world. But this heavenly dish could easily convert me in to a custard believer.  This is my second visit to Fog City, and I'm just as satisfied with my meal as I was the first time. I love going to a restaurant that serves up classic favorites, but also continues to surprise you with new hits.   Keep up the great work, Fog City. I continue to be one of your biggest fans!",

    "review_text": "I've been here several times since the remodel, and each time it has been fine. \u00a0After tonight, though, I won't be going back.   Food: No complaints.  Service: Abysmal. Our waitress was an air-headed imbecile; she took our order, and then we didn't see her again until she decided that she needed to explain how to use the lemon garnish 45 minutes later. My wife had to ask the busboy for an iced tea refill after her glass remained empty for fifteen minutes. On that note, we tipped the busboys directly instead of the waitress, because they did her job for her; they delivered our food, brought us our refills, and cleared our table.  The icing on top: my friend explained the lacking quality of service to the manager as we were leaving, and he had the nerve to follow us out of the restaurant to accost us because of it. He insisted that he had personally delivered our food (he did not, it was the busboy), and he was adamant that he had come by three times to see how we were doing (he came by once.) \u00a0All we wanted to do was make him aware of a genuinely awful waitress; we would have still been back so long as we weren't seated in her section. \u00a0Instead, we will never be returning.   I have no tolerance for ignorant, rude, childish managers or incompetent waitstaff. \u00a0Props to the busboys though.",

    "review_text": "The fries were cooked to have just the right amount of crisp to them but the taste of the cooking oil was just a touch to strong and noticeable.   The butter salad had fresh, flavorful greens and the smokey avocado dressing was a nice compliment. However, the salad just lacked that extra kick or special something.  For the entree I had the burger. I would not order it again. It was a little too wet with all the sauce and extras and the combination of a strangely sweet sauce and the bite from the pickles really didn't work well here. Keep it simple, put more focus on making the meat and bun taste is good as they can.  The ambiance was pretty good, the place was constructed with nice materials, like the rusted metal exterior, to make for a fresh look.   The server was friendly enough and did a good job checking in but could have been around a little more frequently, the kitchen was especially slow tonight and took about 2-3x as long to deliver our entrees as expected (for a couple other guests as well) but we didn't really hear anything about it from the waiter until after we had already been waiting for a good while.   Overall this restaurant has potential, it just needs to sharpen up the staff and refine their dishes a bit more.",
