We went in for a tasting (we had travelzoo too) and we got there a little late for our reservation, but they didn't seem to mind at all. I liked the Sauv blanc, but weren't super impressed by any of the other wines, the Mariah Pinot was decent. Maybe we've been going to too many wine tastings lately (we looooove SFWTC out on Taraval). And the charcuterie plate was nothing too special either, but was a nice addition to the tasting.  I don't know if we'll go back, maybe we'll try it out when they start pouring the next year's vintages. It would definitely be a cool place to take out-of-towners or for a girl's day. They were decorating for an event (with baby pink, ew) but the space looked like it would be really awesome for a party/event.",

Later on we moved into the main winery for a sit down dinner. The room had several glowing amber lights set inside big glass wine containers (carboys?). The lights were all hung at different heights and with the wine barrels in the background, the room looked like something out of a Napa Lifestyle magazine -- Only we were in San Francisco. \u00a0Too cool!   If you are looking for a great new spot to throw a party, I highly recommend Bluxome Street Winery. \u00a0Terrific people, wonderful wines.",

They are the several minutes of romantic refuse in which you think all the trials before and after might not be so bad. They are the all-hope-ain't-lost nights in abandoned shacks when you know all the zombies are still out there, during which a moving yet mellow Tom Petty or Nick Cave song plays gently in the background.  Bluxome Street Winery reminds me of those scenes. Despite what you're going through in life, a trip to this giant wine pub with friends is the ideal respite. Its long wooden tables are designed for convening, and the large interior offers plenty of space for big groups. The wine is good and there is a live band, and that is all anyone really needs for a good time.  I will return once the zombies let down again.",

You wouldn't think to find this tasting room and winery down Bluxome...it is unsuspecting but a total gem.   Highlights: Katie...our fabulous wine server. She knew a lot about the winery as well as the history of how the wine industry has evolved in the area. Pairing pieces of cheese with the Sirah was a great tip, so smooth!  Loved the lighting throughout the space. Katie explained how the lights are on a pulley system making it easy to set whatever mood you want. The lights are strung through large glass jars that were once used in wine-making.   Great spot for grabbing wine after work, throwing a company party, or getting all of your friends together. Remember that this place is not a wine bar, it is a tasting room, so it closes at 7:00 PM (get there early!).  Highly recommending Bluxome Street Winery to friends, family, and all of you Yelpers!",

    "review_text": "THE LOW DOWN Went here last Friday for their BEATS AND EATS - Summer Music and Food Truck series and had a great time! The winery hosts this every Friday throughout July and August. It's basically sampling wines in the $6-$12/glass range, eating yummy Mexican food from the truck stationed outside, and mixing, mingling, and making merriment to a live bluegrass band playing in the back of the space.  THE WINE Oh so tasty. I wasn't in the mood for sampling reds, so I can't speak to their merits (though I heard good things). The Gewurztraminer was sweet without being syrupy and would have been great perhaps after brunch or dessert. The Chardonnay was lovely with its apple and buttery lemon notes. But I finally stuck with the Sauvignon Blanc, which offered the crisp, fruity, light-bodied wine I was craving on that beautiful summer's eve.  THE FOOD The single food truck parked right at the entrance of the event space served soft tacos for $2, Quesadillas and Burritos for $7, and tortas (for $??... I guess the wine was taking effect by that point). The burrito was huge, but delicious. And the soft tacos were the perfect sized snack for someone staving off hunger before dinner. I didn't see anyone order the tortas or quesadillas.   THE SPACE The space is what you'd expect it to look like in SOMA: a gutted out warehouse transformed into a spacious and sleek venue perfect for hosting events. A section of the room was roped off for a private event, but the party was unobtrusive, so it really had no bearing on the rest of the event. The band was set up in the back - a good thing, given the sound was a touch too loud. (And I'm a fan of bluegrass! But I'm also a fan of speaking at a normal volume and hearing my companions when they speak.) There were wine barrels stationed around the room, with seating, so guests could set their glasses aside while they ate. And in the room off to the left across from the restrooms is a bar where a very friendly bartender served very healthy tastings. (Good man. Good man.)  THE CROWD The after-work SOMA crowd pretty much. Although there were a few people with children, the kids were well-behaved (if you can believe it!) and weren't disruptive at all.  THE BOTTOM LINE  Check it out some time. It's not the most original event you will ever go to, but it's definitely a safe bet when trying to satisfy varying entertainment tastes.",

I'm also not much of a pinot drinker, but the two offered were a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the Somona Coast Pinot more than the Russian River one, as it was more fruity and bolder tasting.

    "review_text": "I received a Thrillist email featuring Bluxome Street Winery a few weeks ago, and finally made it over for a tasting on Saturday. The story is that they are going back to the pre-1906 earthquake roots of winemaking in the city...back in the day when the grapes were grown outside the city and brought back in for production. Its a great concept that hasn't really been used since the fire (Prohibition really snarled the rebuilding of urban wineries). Anyways, I digress.   Pros: - Amazingly good wines and a range of varietals. My friend and I split a red and white flight. The red flight featured two pinot noirs and a delicious syrah. The whites included a sauvignon blanc, gewurztraminer and chardonnay.  - Fantastic space and atmosphere. Its definitely a warehouse/winery, so its a bit chilly. But the decor fits the space...big glass lights hanging from the ceiling, exposed beams, concrete and a projection of a pre-1906 earthquake video of SF. Would be great for private parties, events and weddings.  - Friendly staff. I'm a little biased on this, given that my friend works behind the tasting bar (unbeknown to me until we showed up on Saturday).  - Reasonably priced. While its certainly not an everyday drinking wine, most of the bottles were $28 (except for the single vineyard Pinot, which was $45) and the tasting flights were $10 for three wines. It would make a great gift. They also sold wines by the glass and cheese plates.  - While I took the bus, there were plenty of open parking spots on Bluxome Street. This will probably change when the Giants have a game, but otherwise it looked pretty easy.   Cons: - The location is kinda out there if you're not already in SOMA. The proximity to AT&amp;T park makes me think this place will be insanely busy during baseball season.   Overall A fun concept with solid wines--definitely worth a trek across town.",

The tasting room is actually a tiny fraction of the area this place occupies, with great view of the barrel area.

We had 3 flights and two single glasses, which were affordable and quite generous. Along that, we also ordered the charcuterie plate, with salami, cheese, cashews, pickles and dried apricots, all delicious and a good complement to our wines.

    "review_text": "I have been accused of giving too many 5 star reviews lately but this one deserves it. \u00a0Bluxome Street winery is in a warehouse and looks very unassuming but quite nice inside. \u00a0Close to AT&amp;T park and caltrain as well. \u00a0We had a private event here yesterday and our guests really enjoyed the venue, wine and food (and of course the program). \u00a0Everyone seemed to enjoy the Russian River Pinot Noir and drank it like fish. \u00a0The space is open and airy \u00a0and can easily accomodate small and larger size groups. \u00a0The layout enables it to have great versatility and I can see folks using it for bridal showers/ weddings, birthday/anniversary parties, corporate functions, etc. \u00a0We had several guest speakers and a panel at our program and the space worked great for it, The roll down garage door was closed once the presentation began. \u00a0 \u00a0if you are hosting an event here on game day, i recommed providing valet parking for your guests. \u00a0The staff is very friendly and the space is great so planning events here should be a breeze \u00a0I also want to check out their meet market - it's the last Saturday of the month and features artisanal type food.",

Absolute freaking steal. What's even more crazy? The wine is actually good! Shocking. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah. I bought a bottle of Syrah.   Our pourer, the blonde gal, gave very generous pours. She was so sweet and knowledable about the wines and history of wineries in SF. My friend and I had a blast for 2.5 hours trying to finish all that wine.   The last tasting is at 7, so get there early. There's plenty of seating available. Food plate was great! Tastings are normally $15, but with all the wine you get... it is worth it!",
