Having a look at their beer on tap I noticed Sam Adams, second bonus, because that is just delicious goodness !   \u00a0So ok, cold beer now in hand, I'm watching the bartender play the game 24 with dice. I had never played before, but one of the regulars took me under their wing, and also taught me liars dice as well. Third bonus! He then proceeded to notify me that she is a 'formidable opponent' and with great caution, warned me of her skill. I appreciated the heads-up, but throwing caution to the wind, I decided to give it a try. I thought maybe a bit of beginnners luck may be on my side, but it was not to be. Not a real loss though, as it was all in fun, and I was promised a chance to even the score next time.   \u00a0All in all, I personally had a great time ! The beer was cold, I learned a few new games, and all with wonderful conversation. Regular people in a nice atmosphere, and I don't have a suitcase of dirty clothes to wash from my trip. I walked in alone, but quickly felt like a regular. 3star bar, 1 more for Sam Adams on tap, and a star for the very lovely bartender who made me feel like a regular ! Thank you",

After reading other reviews, this place can have the stigma of tomfoolery. The owner morals on paying up on lost games is shoddy. Beware of her, previous reviews are right. FYI she's Korean! Don't group her with the lovable Cantonese folks! I tried to spread her some knowledge about her actions, but she solid about her beliefs!  The veteran and I were here to have fun despite the demeanor of the owner. The crowd that night was great and we had a blast. This place has a jukebox, that requires some funds throughout the night. Unfortunately this place doesn't offer free entertainment after a prolong jukebox silence like some bars do.   Here's my shout out to the bartender that night.

After all that good-deed-doing, I felt I was entitled to a little \"reward\", and what better reward than some tasty adult beverages?  I dragged my tired, overheated ass to the nearest bar, which happened to be Hawaii West. I hadn't been in a couple of years...back when it was dirtier and divier (and I mean that in a good way) and under different ownership. It's a little spruced-up now, but still has a great downscale, neighborhoody feeling.  I lucked out that one of the friendly regulars was there. He took me under his wing and made me feel right at home. He and the adorable little bartendress kept me in stitches with their antics.  After a few cold beers, I forgot all about the day's stresses. Eventually, it was time to \"break the seal\". I found my way to the bathroom, only to discover the toilet clogged and the floor semi-flooded. I went into Mommy Mode and whipped the place into shape, unclogging the toilet and cleaning up the messy floor.  When my new drinking buddy saw me come out, he pointing in another direction and announced: \"Um, that's the wrong bathroom. We use THAT one over there!\"  Yay me...I left Hawaii West in better condition than when I got there.",

This place is what a great dive bar should be: unpretentious, cozy, and regular patrons that will chat with you and make you feel welcome.  The Asian lady of the house is Sonia, and she is fantastic. Bawdy jokes, strong drinks and good company are her forte. And if you're hungry, she'll flip you a burger in the small kitchen behind the bar, too. Trust me, she will take good care of you.  The pool table makes for great ambiance, and there's always someone willing to play. Keep the hits coming on the digital jukebox, and you won't be disappointed.

However, the last time I was there, the bartender/lady who owns the place completely ripped my friend off because she thought we were all drunk (she said this in front of us to her younger bartender-apprentice). Normally when we've been here, a white russian only costs about 6-7$. This time she charged him $20 for 1 white russian, and 1 midori sour. I watched the bartender lady's apprentice (her younger relative??) make the midori sour and it was mostly sweet and sour and midori mix, and no vodka. UM. Mixed drinks will never cost that much, especially at a divebar in a corner of North Beach/Chinatown. My friend didn't care that he was being ripped off caus he was planning on spending all the cash he had on alcohol anyways, so he threw down $3 for tip. Other female friend returned it to him and was like, you already paid enough. Old bartender lady got angry and verbally expressed how my friend should let him do whatever he wants.   Later my guy friend asked what he could get for $7 and the old bartender lady was like.. \"only a shot of soju.\" um.. even if i was blacked out, i would know that a shot of soju should only cost $3, MAX. Female friend starts an argument with old bartender lady, and younger bartender-apprentice out of fear/guilt pours us another soju shot and declares it \"on the house.\"  This place is nice, but the old lady owner/bartender gets really sketchy if she thinks you are drunk. never again.",

Once you step inside of this Faux-Hawaiian oasis, your first thought is, in a city where bars and restaurants struggle to maintain their independent aura due to intense competition and fear of bankruptcy, how does this place stay in business. Aside from two fake plants, there is absolutely nothing special about this bar. It has four walls, a jukebox. Another crappy bonus about this venue is that the North Beach police station is located directly across the street. Great, that's exactly what I need to see after I've drank half a bottle of Jameson's (yes, by myself....are you judging me?), an entire squadron of cops! The best way to describe this place is that it is a sh*ttty version of the bamboo hut. There's no tiki-decor, no live music, no special island cocktails....just old men that are bitter about the hand that life has dealt them, so their only way to fight back is to suck down double gin &amp; tonics every 15 minutes, while promptly giving you the best version of their \"stink eye\" because you are trespassing on their neighborhood bar.
