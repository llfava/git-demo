Sometimes it tastes like it was cooked like it was supposed too, nothing special - sometimes it tastes like it came out of a can or the garbage.  We went here with a party of 8 and dropped close to 1k.  Here is what we got - just to summarize:  1. Weak drinks 2. Clam chowder (6 bowls) that were cold! Literally cold, tasted like it came out of the can - which is probably did please be aware everyone. We sent it back 5 times each time it came out colder with probably some spit in it. 3. OMG the chowder kept on coming back cold, its fricking soup - you can just put it in the microwave. After the 5th time we just ate it and booked it as a loss 4. The crab noodles were inconsistent. Mine were really really spicy and salt. The coworker next to mine were not spicy at all but still really salty.  After the whole soup debacle, nothing was even comped. What a joke of a place!  Next time my company insists on coming here - it is a boycott for me.",

We got seated at a communal table with a another party when there were plenty of regular open tables that we walked right past. Had to ask for bread twice. It came out right before the food. We had no bread plates so instead of putting the bread basket on the table the server used his tongs to hand each of us 1 piece of bread and then left. Asked for water 3 times. It came out with the food. With a clear table and empty glasses we had to wait until the entire patio was cleared out before getting our check. Booooooooooooooooooo",

    "review_text": "I came here for a work lunch, to celebrate our hard work at the end of the year (ugh, working in finance sucks at year end). With 8 of us, we tried most of the menu.  To start with, I got the $11 CALAMARI appetizer to share. It was sooo good. Everyone liked it; my supervisor really liked the spicy aioli. It's topped with an arugula salad and I love arugula. \u00a0I ordered the $22 grilled FRESH FISH as my entree. Apparently I'm way too Chinese because I thought fresh fish = whole fish with head etc. Nope, it's just a big piece. I ordered the escolar hoping for fishy fish; it's not. I should have paid more attention to the server who described it as being between a bass and a salmon, with the flakiness of a white fish. She also said it's a very meaty fish; I felt like I was cutting (with my fork) into chicken. Although it came with a bit of salad, I was glad to have eaten the calamari. Maybe it's because my stomach is at its holiday-stretched size.  FISH 'N CHIPS: the fish were shaped like mozzarella sticks, not the fried fillets I'm used to. My co-worker was not impressed. He said he's had better and prefers them beer dipped. Keep in mind though, he's a beer drinkin', football-watchin' kinda guy. LOBSTER RISOTTO ($30): looked very creamy. My co-worker said it only looked that way and the rice was undercooked. SEAFOOD COBB SALAD: looked good, huge prawns, nice avocado, lots of crab meat. You don't even need to work for your crab and there was plenty of it. CRAB MASHED POTOTES: I tried a bite of it, very buttery. Good if you're into crab; I'm meh about crab. LINGUINE CLAM PASTA: this was the largest entree; I didn't get her take on it.  Pricing: ok on the company dime. Mains are in the $20+ range. Surprisingly decent portions; I'm used to smaller portions in this price point. The CIOPPINO actually had more than one shrimp (reference to the cioppino I got at a highly rated restaurant with meager portions). Don't get it if you're well-dressed as the crab leg is not pre-cracked. When my co-worker started cracking her leg, my other co-worker held up his napkin as a shield.  Service: very nice. Maybe because it's a Wednesday in January and it was dead. We were the only customers. With the 8 of us, 4 servers would come to serve us all at once. Our waters were kept filled too. Only one of us drank faster than they poured.  Bathroom: underneath the stairs by the front door. Dark lighting.  IN SHORT, decent portions for its price point; good service; average to good food. I would come here again for the calamari, probably during happy hour.",

My boyfriend:ordered this and I got the pizza of the day which was shrimp with arugula and cheese. We decided to share everything.  The clam chowder was Luke warm and missing sea food. It was all potatoes. The sole was well cooked but lacking in flavor. The pizza was great! Lots of shrimp and flavor. We didntt make it through the pizza and so I asked for it to to go. This is where it gets a little wired. The waitress grabbed the plate to go put it in a to go container. 10 minutes later we had paid the bill and everything and my food had not returned packed up. When we asked the waitress she had to check with like 3 people before it appeared. When we took it home and opened it it had a piece missing! It concerns me as to what happened to it while it was gone and I couldn't really bring myself to eat it.",

My companion had a sandwich that also included too much mayonnaise and butter. Heavy, uncreative standard food for astronomic prices.

It only comes with some small greens on the side so I also got a side of root vegetables. The tuna and soy wasabi were delicious, the root vegetables weren't anything special - could have used some spices or something. For dessert I got the apple tart with vanilla ice cream, yum.   I went for a work dinner and three other people at the table got the seafood linguini and all finished it, looked like it was a hit. I also heard someone raving about the lobster mac and cheese.  They have a semi-outdoor area in the back right on the water. It is semi-outdoors because there are \"walls\" to block the wind and heaters so it's still warm in there. On a Wednesday night, the outdoor area filled up around 7 so you probably need a reservation if you want to sit there. Otherwise, there were still some tables available inside.

When we asked for butter for the bread they brought one tiny packet. How can restaurant that charges $45 for a steak be cheap with butter and water?!!! We had to send back two of our entrees for being cold and one steak and one swordfish for being completely raw in the middle. I felt like I was on an episode of hell's kitchen with the worst cook on the line. We really could have used Gordon Ramsay to have our backs this Mother's day. Really too bad because the location and view was gorgeous. They also charged two people's credit cards double! Our check had two extra mimosas and one extra champagne on it as well.

(according to the waiter) only half our order was placed into the \"computer\" before the clock clicked over and disabled the happy hour menu therefore charging us normal appetizer rates. \u00a0W-t-f? \u00a0 \u00a0The waiter brought us an extra plate of what we ordered (nice gesture btw) but the plate was kinda poor tasting anyways so I failed to be appeased.

And the service staff are friendly as well. Our waiter automatically brought over extra plates, since he saw that my mom and I were going to be sharing our meal.  We had a crab cake appetizer, which was pretty good. Not as good as the ones I've had in Baltimore, but good nonetheless. We also had their classic SF clam chowder. We weren't too impressed with it, since we both prefer the east coast's kind of chowder, but it was still good. Seasoned just write, and all, and it was very filling. The best part of the meal came from the seafood pasta. There were plenty of clams, scallops, shrimp, etc. The pasta had a nice sauce on it, and it wasn't sickening at all after a large amount. We couldn't finish it, but the waiter gladly had it packed up in a little box for us. We had it overnight in our hotel room, and had it the next day with some bread for breakfast.

We were off to a great start.  We arrived early and notified the staff that we would be waiting at the bar. They told me they would be making some adjustments to make things work. Their happy hour menu was quite good. I highly recommend the oysters, of course. Followed by the delicious truffle parmesan fries and wash it down with one of their well drinks which are also on special from 5-7pm daily. Our bartender was extremely attentive and the oysters on the half shell were great appetizers.  All of the guests in our party arrived and they were able to accomodate the changes that I requested. We were seated by the window and it had a spectacular view of the San Francisco Bay and the Bay Bridge. I was very impressed.  Everyone was here for the Dine About Town dinner so I started off with the soup. I want to point out the sample menu was different than what was listed on the website. The clam chowder was better than most places and the most notable thing about it was the large pieces of clams in the soup. For the main course I ordered the hanger steak, cooked medium rare. It was well seasoned and cooked right as expected. The fries again were quite good. Dinner finally ended with creme brulee for desert and we were all very satisfied with the dinner service.",

    "review_text": "Ever since I could remember, my birthday has always fallen inside what adolescents affectionately refer to as \"spring break.\" It's that crazy time of year when people do even crazier things. For the past couple years, I've been lucky enough to observe this week-long celebration of the coming of spring (characterized by inebriation, heavy partying, and usually a lot of nudity) in South Beach. Spring break in Cancun? That's for children compared to Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference week in Miami. And this year was no different. I flew back from four straight days of debauchery on Sunday night, and I was DEAD tired. All I wanted to do for my birthday the next day was sleep. However, having the sweetest sister in the world (poor me), she wanted to invite a couple of my friends and set up a little birthday dinner. How could I possibly say no to that?   Sis suggested that we go to the Waterfront. I knew where it was, but I hadn't been there in years. Since I wasn't doing any of the planning, I basically let my little sister do all the legwork. We got there about 15 minutes late, but thanks to the adorable valet who calls all the ladies \"bella\", we were able to get inside right away. My sister had called ahead and requested a table with a view, and they had told her they would try to accommodate us as much as possible, but it so happened that there was a huge Siemens conference going on that night and they had taken up the entire downstairs patio that overlooked the bay. Waterfront, however, was gracious enough to save a table for us upstairs that had an equally amazing view. We were seated right away.  Our waiter came by and gave us the usual spiel on recommendations for the night. He then took our order, sans notepad. I love when they do that. Not only was the staff extra knowledgeable about the food, they were helpful and attentive, even though we were sitting in a table tucked away into one of the more secluded corners of the restaurant. Our glasses were never empty, our dishes came out promptly, and our food was at perfect temperature. I had the handmade seafood linguini, but I did try a little bite from everyone else, and they all tasted amazing. When the lobster mac and cheese came out, I could smell the truffle oil wafting into my brain and tantalizing all my senses. I. Love. Truffle. And you put truffle AND lobster AND cheeeeeeeese together? Kill me now. I'm in heaven. The staff brought out the cake my sister bought at the end of the night, let me blow out the candles, then took it back to the kitchen only to return 10 minutes later with perfectly cut pieces for my guests and I. By the time we were done with dessert and paying the bill, we were full, happy, and we all decided to leave extra tip on top of our 18% gratuity, because the service was so good. We hadn't even noticed that we were the last table in the restaurant, because no one had rushed us out, even though it was way past closing.   Waterfront, you are one class act. Thank you for making my birthday dinner absolutely perfect.",

My perception of this restaurant is that it's for tourists...and then I made the mistake of reading what Yelper's had to say...oh dear! To start the evening...traffic was horrendous and my husband had trouble getting back to The City on time. He called the restaurant to say how sorry he was that we'd be running late...45 minutes late! They were very nice about the situation and held our table for us! Okay, I thought...this is not so bad.  We arrive and I have to say that yes the view is really lovely...and our table was situated where we could see both the Bay Bridge and a bit of The City...it WAS romantic. The menu was Prix Fixe for Valentines day. The waiter was very nice and the menu choices were interesting. Ordering is a bit silly in that those poor waiters are forced to use these really stupid little hand-held gadgets to place the orders...and it just doesn't go smoothly as you have to order in a particular order...how weird! If they would just take out an old-school piece of paper and a pen it would have added a little personal touch instead of feeling a little like a roving fast food order taker.  But the food...I started with the Ahi Tuna Tartar...Japanese Citrus and Cumin Scented Wonton Crips...it was good, really good...the combination of the citrus and the coolness of the Tuna...I gobbled it up quick! We had a second course but it came after the main course...which was A Wild Mushroom Mascarpone stuffed Chicken Breast...and it was good too...the molded polenta thing was terrible and made me think the plate had been set up at like four in the afternoon and when they cooked the chicken they slapped it on that plate and sent it out. And you know that is a real shame because the chicken was very tasty. Why they would ruin it with that polenta is beyond me. When our second course arrived with apology...it was good...it was a salad and I just can't rave about a salad. For desert I had the Chocolate Fondant and yep...it was super scrumptious!  Over all the food was good, we were very well watered, breaded and cocktailed...it's just subtle things that R E A L L Y make a difference between a meh restaurant and a Y E A H restaurant! I think if Waterfront could turn it up a notch or two, they could be really good.",

The \u00a0waitress approaches us and friendly Matt asked her how her day is going. \u00a0She then proceeds to whine to us for a good five minutes about how she worked a double on both Saturday and Sunday, and is only still at the restaurant (On Monday around 230pm) b/c a co-worker called out sick. Wahh wahh, cry me a river. We don't want to hear that. Make something up and pretend like you're having a decent day, considering it was 65 degrees, sunny, and President's Day! \u00a0  We finish up our bottle of champagne and move inside around 430 when it started to get a bit chilly outside. \u00a0We met some cool folks at the bar and the bartender was friendly and talked me into ordering some sweet drink that he swore wouldn't be too sweet for me after telling him over and over I did NOT want a sweet drink. \u00a0  Well, he talks me into it and it was gross and way too sweet. We split the sliders and fried calamari and shrimp, which were both good, but definitely nothing spectacular. \u00a0They have about 6 or 7 appetizer options to choose from that are $5 each from 3-7pm Monday-Saturday. Not a bad deal. \u00a0Well drinks are also $5 and beers on tap are only $3!   So, just based on happy hour, ambiance (the lovely outdoor patio facing the bay/Bay Bridge), and the wine/champagne selection, Waterfront Restaurant is pretty A-OK in my book. \u00a0However, I do not plan on having a full-on dining experience here.",

The service was excellent. The patio seating was comfortable, not too cool or hot. The food was not terrible. I had Tuna served rare with citrus wasabi sauce, crab mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. My wife had a filet mignon (supposedly medium, but more on the well done side) and spinach.  It cost me 200 bucks for dinner, tip, 2 glasses of wine, a couple of cocktails, desert, a cup of coffee, and valet parking.  This is a case of a mediocre establishment being in an excellent location.

The restaurant has a beautiful view of the bay, and I really like how they have a mezzanine seating area as well as the outside deck.   The food, honestly, wasn't the BOMB, but it was decent. True, the price is on the pricier end, considering the quality of the food. But overall, it wasn't bad. I ordered the DUNGENESS CRAB SANDWICH, which was a lot more filling than it looked. They gave you SO MUCH CRAB inside the sandwich...and the taste is on the saltier end for sure. The dressing for the salad was also on the salty end, which I didn't like as much. After dinner, I had a CAPPUCINO and also shared the DESSERT MINI SAMPLER between 3 people. The desserts were decent, nothing too special.   Overall, I think it's a pretty nice restaurant for tourists to come to, or for business lunches. The view is very nice, it's comfortable, and decent food.

I came to this restaurant only because I saw that they had dine around town special, so I followed the link on opentable and made a reservation for dinner. Once we got there, I was already disappointed at the decoration of the place, the outside was extremely gorgeous but once you walk in, everything inside looks old and dirty. None of the staffs had smiles on their face and you would expect a nice restaurant to have great customer service right? Nope... Not here. It took them basically 10 mins to set a table up and there's barely any other customers in the restaurant.   Once we sat down, I asked for the dine around town menu and the \"mute\" looking waiter said they don't have a menu for that. He went over to ask his manager and that's when I found out they don't do dinners for dine around town, only for lunch. So why was there a dinner menu on \u00a0the dine around town website? That's false advertisement! I went over to talk to the person in charged, supposedly the manager of the place. He obviously did not care, no wonder all his staffs act the same as him. He said \"dine around town\" is for people who cannot afford fine dining and his restaurant does not need that kind of service because they have 300 tables booked for the night. I'm very curious to find out how many other tables that came in yesterday and left because of the false advertisement. A manager that knows how to run a restaurant business will understand the value of customers satisfaction, it was quite disappointing that he did not even try to keep customers around.   Nevertheless, I will not come back to this place to even bother to try the food. The service, the environment (besides the bay bridge view, which you can get that \u00a0at 10 other restaurants along the pier) and the food is just not attractive at all. If you are interested in fine dining experience in San Francisco or try to impress on a date please don't fall for this place. Good luck!",

I'm not happy to give this sort of review because I don't like to trash anyone or any establishment, but I have to report things as I see them. \u00a0I asked a few people in my party what they thought of the restaurant and they were not impressed either. \u00a0I know one of them who is also from the Bay Area will be writing their own review. \u00a0A couple of our clients from the UK and Japan were not impressed with the service or food either. \u00a0I won't be recommending this place to any business partners or friends.",

Entrees were less successful. We agreed that all of our entrees (tuna, chicken breast, and salmon) were seasoned and cooked well, but it seemed they had sat under a heat lamp for a bit, as they had all dried out somewhat.  Desserts were ok. Tasty, but not particularly special.  This place wins for the view and service. Food is not bad, but it makes a lot more sense for special occasions and to show off the town.",

Great view of the Bay bridge, Yuerba Buena and Treasure Island. We were seated quickly as there were only 3 other parties. We ordered drinks, skipped the appetizers and went right for the entrees.  I ordered the Grilled \"SRF\"(Snake River Farm) American Wagyu Flatiron Steak with a Demi-Glace and Mashed Potatoes. Also got a side of Grilled Asparagus.  The steak was very tasty, cooked medium-rare and quite juicy. However, it was a very small serving, even with the potatoes it was as filling as an average appetizer. For $24 it was too small of a portion. Grilled asparagus was undercooked, had grill marks but was still very crunchy and cold.  I tasted some of the Crab Mashed Potatoes which were delicious, much tastier than the regular mashed potatoes that came with my steak.   The service was quite bad. After we ordered Entrees the waitress did not come back for ~30 minutes. We were all in need of drinks for a long time. 2 of the sides we ordered never showed up, and one of them was the wrong order. My friend's entree showed up as another wrong order, and it took another 20 minutes or so to bring the correct one out. After we were all finished and waiting for a dessert menu, again our waitress was nowhere to be found. We planned on ordering dessert, but by the time she got to our table we were off the idea.  The poor service was surprising as it was a very quiet night at the Waterfront. I wish i could've tried some more dishes as there were many interesting menu items, however what I had was overpriced and did not fill me up. The general manager came to our table afterwards to thank us and ask how everything was - which was nice - but, too little, too late.",

Nothing. Frankly. \u00a0See Presidio Yacht Club.   In any case, I was pleased to find the Waterfront's selection of reasonably priced drinks, a good menu, and outdoor seating (both tables and open seating at benches). \u00a0  You could do a lot worse. \u00a0For some reason, you guys have decided that the best use of the waterfront over a bit west is for things like Rainforest Cafes and the Hard Rock variety. \u00a0Time to take that back.",

My mother and I decided to have some dessert &amp; made sure to ask the waiter if there were any nuts because I am SEVERELY ALLERGIC. He assured me there was not. Unfortunately, my tongue &amp; throat started to itch &amp; swell after my first bite. Now, almost 6 hours later, I'm still covered in hives. Had I taken a second bite, my throat would have completely shut. That was the result after one bite, had I trusted the waiter with his reassurance that there were no nuts, I would've ended up in the hospital.   Oh, it gets worse. Our bill was a hefty price which we completely did not mind. However, the same waiter told us our card had not gone through &amp; requested for another one. When we checked the account the following morning, we discovered that he charged us 3 times and we ended up with a grand total of $500 charged.

Service was super quick. This can be good and bad but our food was served hot so that's good!  To start off: The Market Green Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette was good. But $9 for a side salad? Wow. It wasn't that great for $9.   We ordered some raw oysters: MALPEQUE, FANNY BAY, HAMA HAMA. I like the Fanny Bay and Malpeque the most. They were medium size, nothing too small, but nothing big. Eat it with the sauce they provide, it adds to the flavor.   The bread they served could have been a bit warmer....  Onto the entrees: The Blackened Ahi Tuna, Spinach, Red Wine Reduction had a smokey taste to it which was pretty good. Their mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery...yummy!  I had their 40th anniversary special which included a starter soup/salad, entree and desert for only $40. Score!! I chose the Butternut Squash. It had a curry taste to it. Nothing to die for, but good enough. I ordered the 1.5lb Whole Maine Lobster with Summer Vegetables. Yummy! They don't crack the whole thing for you which is kind of a bummer because you have to get all messy and stuff but it was good!  For desert we shared the Peach Cobbler with ice cream.

It was definitely an older crowd, but it's understandable since it IS a really nice restaurant. We were told that for happy hour, we had to sit at the bar or at their couches, but it was pretty full when we got there. One of the waitresses was really nice and told us it's okay if we sat at the tables, so yep, that's where we kicked it back and had our happy hour, with the whole nice dinner set up and all.   The main reason YOU should come here: $1 oysters and $3 beers. Oysters were bombbbbbb...mmm hmmmmmmmmmmmm. We ordered two dozens for 4 people (but pretty much shared by me and my buddy). Beers were good too of course. We also ordered some other appetizer dishes from their happy hour menu, like \"truffle fries\" I believe? and calamari? The portions for those were pretty small and I GUESS pricier than normal for happy hour, but hey, it was not bad at all at such a classy restaurant. The server was also really attentive. He even served us bread, as if we were actually having dinner.   Considering I was with a bunch of boys, they just watched a basketball game at the bar after, so the place can be pretty cool and laid-back too. After that, we hung out at their balcony with a GORGEOUS view of the bay. I can't rave about their non-happy hour, but this is definitely not a bad place to START a night out!

But if you have money to blow and are a fan of bland food and tiny portions by all means go to waterfront! Its that place for you! Cheers!",

We all decided without driving all the way to the beach, this would suffice. We found some seats fairly quickly on thier gorgous outdoor patio. Sadly because this is the city, they had little to no shade! The waiter was really pretty fast, of corse I let him know I stay really thirsty so he obliged my request. The food was ok...  Oysters, they were ok? Not really that big. Tasted pretty fresh. I admit if its not hog farm.....then it just doesn't measure up in my palette   French-fries- I know its happy hour, but how about more then 10 fries???? YES IM HUNGRY.  Onion rings- These were not cooked to the crisp perfection I was hoping for  Mussels- These were the best of all the happy hour items we tried. Very well seasoned and cooked  I peaked at the regular menu and I will only ever return for happy hour. As if they give pathetic servings for happy hour I just know my husband would not get his fill here. So that'll be a no for the 50 steak.",

    "review_text": "I wanted to take my girlfriend out for a good birthday meal, preferably with a beautiful view of the city. Waterfront Restaurant came to mind because she mentioned it to me, so if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have known about this place and probably dined in some French restaurant on Geary.   First off, we were greeted politely by one of the waitress and the host and we were given a table at the corner of the restaurant with a beautiful view looking out towards the Bay bridge and the ferry terminal. It was very comfortable and the lights were dim enough to make me feel like my vision was that of a senior. Nevertheless, it was pretty decent table.  We didn't want to drink, so we kept our waters, which has a strange flavor that I can't quite describe. Either way, I was gurping water down like I returned from a desert trek.   They served us some bread after ordering, which didn't come in baskets, but rather having a waiter placing a couple of slices on the plate (good way to control cost?). Nothing special there, though I wish the bread was warm even though it was fresh bread.   We ordered the Dungeness Crab Cakes for appetizers, which was nothing but crab meat! It was on a cream-based sauce and both went very well together. The crab cake itself was crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. Very good by my opinion. Then there's the Crab Mashes Potatoes. Lots of potatoes, some strains of crab meat. Not that great. It's also not very consistent as some bites contain less crab meat than others.   For entrees, my girlfriend ordered the Over-baked Sea Bass with a lemon butter sauce (I think). Sea bass is always good and the night's sea bass was light and flaky. The sauce was interesting, but I felt like it wasn't doing much to the fish. I ordered the Black Angus NY Steak (just cause I felt like it) and it came with two types of sauce (Coconut butter sauce and A1-ish sweet sauce), sauteed string beans with bacon and a butt load of fries. I had the steak ordered Medium-rare and I'm happy it came out that way. Downside, it's drier than I thought. The steak wasn't as juicy as I would expect it to be, so less points there. Now the sauces was quite a delight, especially the coconut butter sauce, which is the better of the two. The other sauce is just...blah... The string beans was good with that touch of bacon, but nothing great after that. The fries is quite the surprise. I would think mashed potatoes would look nicer with the steak on top, but these fries are something else. Now I have beef against soggy fries and I like them crispy and hot. These fries didn't stay warm for too long, but the surprise came from its crispy till the end of my meal! Props to the crispy fries!  I thought the Waterfront restaurant wasn't as bad as I anticipated from the Yelp reviews, but some dishes could have been better. It isn't bad for a date dinner, but I'm pretty sure there are better places out there.",

The accompanying serrano chili oil did nothing for me though. For the calamari and rock shrimp appetizer ($14), they used buttermilk which held on to the frying oil. Heavy. We all agreed and would have preferred a lighter and fresher batter.   Their heirloom tomato salad with beets and burrata was silky smooth. Nice flavor from the persimmons. Beautiful presented. $14.

It was ok, I like chimichurri but this one was too herbal for my tastes. The accompanying polenta fries were the star. A crust on the outside with a melted gooey inside.   2011 has been a challenging and great year so I celebrated by ordering the most expensive item on the menu. The grilled snake river farms 12 oz American wagyu new york strip ($39) with a side of lobster mac and cheese ($12). The steak was a perfect medium rare with a solid char. I didn't ask if it had been aged but it tasted like it. I thought about giving Waterfront 4 stars because I loved the steak but it's more of a testament of Waterfront NOT messing up the steak and just letting the Snake River wagyu speak for itself. It was more lobster scraps with the watery mac and cheese. Get the steak, skip the lobster mac.

If you get a chance also try their crab mashed potatoes and wild mushrooms.   I have to say I am baffled by the negative reviews below. I have received impeccable service from the staff every time I have come here whether it be lunch or dinner. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is because there is a hostess there that has an abrupt personality. Other than that the servers are attentive and there is a private parking lot next to the restaurant with valet parking for only $10. If that weren't convenient enough they can put the $10 directly on your bill if you're like me and never carry cash. They have a great selection of wine and champagne. The restaurant itself has been remodeled and has a very modern feel to it.   I must admit that when I returned from a long weekend away from my honey and he mentioned he had made reservations here I was disappointed due to all the negative reviews posted.

The location of this restaurant cannot be beat! With views overlooking the bay and the bridge, I can certainly see why they try to get away with the prices they charge - but sadly - the food does not do justice to the view.  I had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were under ripe, and I question whether or not they were actually heirloom tomatoes. It had a small - very small - amount of delicious buratta cheese on top - and get this - wait for it - fried onions (like those you get in a can for green bean casserole for Thanksgiving dinner). I believe there was one small piece of wilted basil as well. VERY disappointing.  I had the Wagu beef steak with arugula as my entree (entrees are served a la carte - and from what I hear - the lobster mac and cheese is a good side dish option). The pile of plain, fresh from the bag arugula went untouched (why even bother putting it on the plate? i would call it an expensive garnish). The steak was mediocre, and heavily salted. It came with a sweet dipping sauce to cover the poor preparation. Avoid it.   Other items at the table that got equally poor reviews ; clam chowder (sweet and too rich), Choppino (full of salmon and pretty much nothing else). Our waiter was loud, bizarre, and condescending.

The place, like everyone here is saying, is in a splendid location. Dim lighting, good seating, great view. There was this one table that was placed right behind the podium, cramped in the walkway that led to the main restaurant and right in front of the kitchen doors (I don't know if you can visualize that, but I SERIOUSLY crossed my fingers that we wouldn't be given that seat haha).  But we got there around 6ish I believe and surprisingly we were seated immediately in the back, with a great view of the ocean. Like some other reviews have noted, they did not give us any of the open tables right next to the water...maybe it's a policy to only give prime seating to old men who bring young women and buy a shit ton of wine. I kid.  To be honest, we weren't that hungry, we just wanted to spend some time to chat out of the cold. SO, we ordered some appetizers and some dessert.  I have to say, they have some bomb ass $7 french fries (HAHAH). Their clam chowder was pretty bland and bleh (I had some clam chowder from Fisherman's Wharf the other day, and OMG SO FREAKIN GOOD)... Their crab cakes are reaaally good.   We also got the dessert sampler, which had 4-5 different tasties in it for $18 I believe. The brownie with chocolate ice cream was my favorite. It was so freaking good.  Overall, the prices were above-average but understandable. The food itself was okay-to-good. The place itself was gorgeous. That in itself would be 3-4 stars.  But like many people have said, the service was not the best. Well, more specifically, our server was just plain WEIRD. He was European for sure, but that notwithstanding, he just served us very....strangely. His response to anything I asked, requested, or said, was a...2-second stare and a general nod (not in my direction). LOL, I mean I got what I needed, but it was so ...strange. No tableside banter or recommendations, just 5-7 NODS all night. The busboys or what you would call them were attentive, although all-over-the-place at times. Plenty of shoulder bumps and nods throughout the night from the staff to each other. But our waters were constantly refilled...the staff was polite. Oh, and they were definitely older than the standard 20-somethings you usually get in restaurants, which is fine.  But I would say this restaurant with its service was \"A-ok\" but not \"Yay! Im a Fan\"  ...moral of the story is, Yelp! reviewers do not lie. *nod*",

It's a nice beautiful day Friday, cool breeze and perfect weather in San Francisco. It was a perfect time to have oysters and happy hour. We came here and my friend and I wanted to stay outside. \u00a0We found 2 chairs without a table outside overlooking the bay. \u00a0We approached a waiter to request if a chair can be pulled for us. We would settle with this just to stay outside. To our surprise, another waiter instead, let's call him Mustafa, gave us an angry look in his eyes look and with his voice raised, \" I will not pull a chair for you!\" he didn't say it once but twice and even louder. We were caught by surprise and felt harassed! \u00a0So we asked for his name, he said he will not give his name to us. It was getting embarrassing for me and especially my friend who was celebrating her birthday. It was my treat. We asked fellow waiters not the first two who belittled us for a manager to help us rectify the situation. Well, Mustafa followed us as we approached the manager to explain our request. \u00a0Mustafa circled around us and again, repeated what he said...again! He won't leave us We heard him instructing the \"manager\" not to listen to us and instead not serve us. This is bad for it was getting uncomfortable. The bad waiter acted very authoritative than a hospitable server. His angry eyes still following us as we walked outside to look for a table. He felt like a stalker ready to attack me and my friend. To cut a long story short. We still stayed cause the manager got us a table, we tried to enjoy the last hour of the happy hour, talk to the owner..Mr. Al...Unfortunately nothing was being done. \u00a0We even paid our bill fully left a tip for the other waiters just to show were fair to the other waiters who were very apologetic. Conclusion? We will never come back, ever! I have a lot of good memories here but unfortunately I will have to erase this place from my favorite lists. No class! The place lacks quality service and style. \u00a0They need to ditch the old waiter. \u00a0He's a terrible person, He looks like he can attack patrons.",

Negatives: The food was heavy. \u00a0For example, the oil in the fryer for the buttermilk calamari appetizer was obviously not hot enough. \u00a0(When the oil isn't hot enough, the breading soaks up a lot of oil; when the oil is at the correct temperature, the breading immediately seals with a nice crunchy coating.) \u00a0The seafood pasta entree had too much seafood for the amount of pasta. \u00a0The chairs were chintzy aluminum tubing. \u00a0The tab came to $75 for lunch for one appetizer, two entrees, no alcohol, and tip - that's a lot for lunch for two.

(No, I didn't read the reviews until after I'd been there. Live 'n' learn.\")  I took my mom and two of her best friends there for dinner on Christmas night. We were mainly there to celebrate her birthday, which also falls on Dec. 25. Mom and I split an entree and a salad, and her friends had full dinners. Everyone had drinks, and no dessert. It wasn't a huge tab, but definitely over $100.   The food was OK--nothing extremely memorable. But the service was just plain lame. It was too bad our waiter had to work on Christmas, but it was also too bad we had to suffer through his bad mood. Still, we overlooked all of that. We were together, and we had a great time.  Then came dessert. None of us ordered, because we were full from dinner. Nonetheless, I got up and told the waiter it was my mom's birthday. This traditionally results in a small comped dessert and candle. He proceeded to bring us a DESSERT PLATE WITH A CANDLE ON IT. No dessert--only a candle. I've seen a lotta tacky restaurant service behavior in my life, but this guy grabbed the brass ring.  Was he angry that our check wasn't huge? Did he think we were lying that it was my mom's b'day? I have no idea, but we were disgusted. Seems like the idiot would realize that a comped dessert usually results in a big tip. I gave him a decent tip, and we left without saying a word.

The damage is done if people are willing to take time to Yelp about it. This place is just poorly managed. It is so clear to see and as a customer - one should never know what goes on behind the scenes but it is written on every employees face - they don't want to be there and it is probably because their whack manager chewed them out when they were just over sat.   Also a 'hot' hostess doesn't make the best hostess. They need to know how to streamline the seating and organization of customer flow. Needless to say, the food is lacking and the price is beyond high.",

After our visit on Friday June 27 (with reservations) I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason to return. The service was really awful. It wasn't overly crowded at 7:00 PM \u00a0but we sat to wait for a table and then once seated we waited and waited and waited. Finally a bus server came by our table, poured some water and asked if we needed anything. We politely requested that our waiter visit our table. A few minutes later he did. No greeting, no apology no nothing. He stood there with his tablet in hand and waited for us to begin a dialog. It didn't get better as the evening went on and while the food is good, who needs to pay for inattentive service. It was as if he was completely bored with the whole ordeal. I'd like to say good things about the food, but honestly, it starts with people! There are better places to go, so pass this one by and find something else.",

We figured we would pick a random restaurant along Embarcadero would be good. Lo and behold, we ended up picking the Waterfront Restaurant. We haven't been there and were curious to see what sumptuous food awaited for us.   The location is gorgeous. We were seated almost immediately against the windows near the outside patio. A gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge in the evening and a server who was very polite and attentive to us. We ordered the seared Ahi Tuna, a side of the crab mashed potatoes, garlic french fries, and a half dozen fresh oysters on the half shell as appetizers.   It was a great evening for us to catch up on what's going in our busy lives. The oysters came out first and were so fresh and delicious. Our eyes lit up as we savored each one. \u00a0Then our main meal came out. The Ahi Tuna was grilled rare (just the way I like it!) and the soy wasabi sauce was very tasty! The crab mashed potatoes were my favorite thing out of everything we ordered. Fluffy and light with crab evenly distributed in every mouthful. MMMM. Deliciousness!  All in all, it was a fantastic evening and we had a wonderful time. Of course, the restaurant was more on the pricey side but since we hardly hang out anymore, it was worth the experience.",

Aside from the spectacular view, the food fell short. The service was decent, although the wait staff wouldn't leave us alone long enough to enjoy the meal. I realize that attentive wait staff is a good thing... but being bothered every 5 minutes didn't make much for a great conversation. Though our waitress, Chelsea was very helpful, the other 2 people tending to us were quite annoying. As far as the food was concerned, I went with the Dine About Town (DAT) featured salad, the Kobe Beef Burger, and added their Waterfront Clam Chowder to the mix. The salad... was salad; no bugs, yay!. The Kobe Burger was dry. I had ordered it to be medium, but it came super dry and well done; cooked through. The Clam Chowder was probably the highlight of the meal. But that's not why I'm giving this place just 2 stars. Why am I giving this place a 2 star rating you ask? Well my wife ordered the DAT salad and pasta. The problem was mainly with her meal. While she was enjoying her pasta, she unfortunately ate a rotten mussel which she described as tasting like feces (if you could put a taste to feces), and she found shell fragments in her pasta as well. So I'm giving it a 2 out of 5... and I'm sticking to it. We may come back to give them another shot, but for now... they get a 2 from me.",

After a while he said \"it will be a while before I can get to you\", and continued stacking glasses. Another couple also waiting for service, shrugged at us, like \"WTH\"? \u00a0After a while longer. he finally took our cocktail order. He made our drinks, and as he was finishing up, the olives on my bloody Mary fell to the counter, he threw the olives on the floor and shoved the drink at me with no garnish whatsoever. The drink was not even tasty.... hmmm off to a sketchy start.  Once we were seated in the dinning area the service improved a bit. We started with oysters on the half shell. My husband &amp; I normally love oysters, but these were kind of fishy \u00a0and the sauce was just plain ketchup (not even cocktail sauce), we were not impressed. For lunch we each ordered a crab salad (two different kinds). Hubby ordered something like a crab Louie, which he said was ok, and I ordered the crab &amp; avocado salad, which was just that \"a little crab, a few thin slices of avocado, and about 3 maybe 4 slices of tomato \" no lettuce, no dressing. I will say the tomato slices were good, I just wish there were more of them. The portion size was small.  We don't feel the desire to try this restaurant again.",

When we arrived, the hostess didn't greet us, smile or even say anything to us first. We told her that we had reservations and her exact words were, \"There were some people that arrived late and some people that arrived early so we are trying to even it out.\" Strange.. but we didn't think of it too much at the moment so we took a seat at the bar thinking that we'd get seated shortly. Twenty minutes went by so we checked in to see if they skipped or forgot about us and the hostess said that it would be another twenty minutes before our table would be ready. You've got to be kidding?! That would make it forty minutes after our scheduled reservation. We waited at the bar and had another round of drinks. I could see the frustration of other couples at the bar also. The additional twenty minutes went by and the table was still not ready. I noticed that couples that showed up after us were seated before us so that really pushed me over the edge. Checked in with the hostess again and she said that we were next to be seated. Almost an hour and FINALLY we were told that our table was ready. Walked upstairs and turned out that our table wasn't ready so we had to wait again for them to clean/set it up. We finally took our seats, looked at the menu and ordered.  Started off with the star route little gem salad. It was drenched in dressing! Way too much on a salad. Would have been better with less dressing. Had the wagyu cut filet as my main and it was cooked the way I wanted and was good. For dessert, I wanted the vanilla bean creme brulee but was told that they ran out so ordered the warm apple tart tatin instead.   The star goes to the great view. Food wasn't horrible.. it was decent but the ridiculous wait made this experience not so memorable and made this entire dining experience bad. Would have been better off cooking and eating a nice meal at home. Why would you seat early arrivals and not give tables to those who have reservations at that time or those with reservations that have been waiting? Doesn't make any sense. That just screws up the entire purpose of reservations. Understandable if fifteen minutes plus late but that wasn't the case in our situation.  Won't be coming back here again. There are so many other restaurants in the city and other restaurants with great views with much better service and food. They don't and won't make guests with reservations wait almost an hour for a table!",

The service is A+: server was there each time we wanted bread. Now as for food. We got the calamari for starters and it was a delicious plate with a different type of spicy sauce. As part of dine about town I got the clam chowder (smooth, delicious, creamy, kind of small) and the sole (a little simple, good sauces, big portion). The dessert platter was large with 3 mini desserts and nuts with chocolate in between (delicious). The place is a little expensive, but it is the Embarcadero and half the price is due to the view. I would recommend this place for a warm Sunday lunch on the bay.",

    "review_text": "Fellow Yelpers, please do yourselves a favor and DO NOT go to this restaurant.   I cannot fully put into words how dreadful my experience was. My fianc\u00e9 (now husband) and I reserved the upstairs main dining room for our wedding reception (which was to take place in June) back in January of this year. The following 7 months of working with The Waterfront were less than stellar. We dealt with a handful of staff members, all of whom provided us with contradictory information (including, Cheryl). Upon originally signing the contract, we were told that the items for our wedding reception could be dropped off the evening before the wedding reception.   Following a few attempts to contact the person with whom we signed the contract with follow-up questions via email, we were put in contact with another individual, who explained to us that the staff member with whom we worked with was no longer working for The Waterfront Restaurant, and that they would be assisting us with the setup, organization, and finalization of our wedding reception.   In order to ensure that everything originally agreed upon was still going to be honored, I took an afternoon off work to meet with the new contact at The Waterfront Restaurant. She explained that we would not be able to drop any items off at The Waterfront the day before the reception, as the earliest anything could be dropped off at the venue was 3:00PM the day of the event.   As the day of our wedding drew closer, I attempted to reach out to the new contact a couple of times with questions regarding seating charts, but heard nothing back. A few days later, I heard from Cheryl, who brought to my attention that the second staff member whom I was working with was no longer working in the special events department. My fianc\u00e9 called Cheryl and had a phone conversation where she confirmed everything that had been agreed upon with the previous staff members.  Over the course of the following month, Cheryl and my fianc\u00e9 had a handful of email exchanges regarding seating layout, children's menu, removing of tables for a dance floor, etc. Though exhausted and dissatisfied with the amount of effort I, the client, had to put into verifying such details, I was confidant that all was in order and that our wedding reception would be wonderful.  Imagine my surprise when seconds after the conclusion of my and my fianc\u00e9's wedding ceremony, we were reached out to via phone call from our family friends, who were not being allowed in to setup, as the banquet manager on duty said that he had heard nothing of their arrival and that no setup could start until 4:30PM. Cheryl, of course, was not onsite.  After nearly 30 minutes of reasoning, the staff began setting up the room, finally allowing our family friends to initiate setup. To add insult to injury, the banquet manager was extraordinarily rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional to not only the setup staff, but to members of the wedding party and to the DJ, who also arrived early for setup.  On top of the above mentioned \"miscommunications\", the banquet manager was never given permission to serve our tiny (baked to serve only eight people) bundt cake, as we were serving our guests creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. The banquet manager, Mustapha, went on to cut 30 incredibly thin slices of cake and serve only a portion of our guests (we had more than 80 guests), defending his actions by explaining that it was too late not to serve and be charged for the service as he had already sliced the cake.   My fianc\u00e9 and I formally reached out to Cheryl with a very thorough and respectful note outlining our experience, and asking for a proposed solution. Cheryl's response was very rude and dismissive; not once did she offer an apology. She also had the nerve to call my husband and leave him a belittling voicemail, suggesting that we should feel \"lucky\" when looking at the \"bigger picture,\" appreciating the \"deal\" that we were given. That she would never allow a wedding to take place on a Saturday for the amount of money we spent.  We reached out to the owner, Al Falchi, after realizing that Cheryl was unwilling to make good on our original agreement not being honored. In addition to not returning our phone calls or emails, he had Cheryl call my husband, again. She was extremely disrespectful and stated that they would not be giving a penny back to us and that we can sue them if we want, before hanging up.   Al Falchi, as it is incredibly evident that you are so particularly fond of apologizing via Yelp, I look forward to what I am sure will be an elaborate expression of your sincerest apologies with no proposed solution. Or perhaps, you will offer not apology either, which will continue to speak to the treatment one can expect from The Waterfront managerial staff.  Yelpers, please note that I am not the type of person to bash a business, but felt very obligated to in this instance. I hope that most of you will take my advise to NOT have a special event held here.",

My favorite is the clam chowder with smoked applewood bacon. I am pretty picky about my chowder and this by far is my favorite I've ever had. It was creamy yet flavorful. The clams weren't fishy or incredibly \u00a0chewy. There was just a hint if bacon that added that something special to the dish. I also ordered a Kentucky Lemonade for $11. Sure it might seem pricey but the amount of alcohol and taste make up for it. Of course while waiting for my chowder I had bread and better and let me tell you this was some of the best tasting better I've had at a restaurant. It may seem trivial, but I couldn't get enough of it.   I like to sit at the bar since all I wanted was a bowl of chowder and a quick relaxing lunch. The bar area has one tv for those sports fans that walk in, but this is in no way a sports bar. White table clothes and suited up waiters prove this point. They have both indoor and outdoor seating for those warm sunny days and small but clean bathrooms. I will be returning for a visit again sometime soon.",

Here is some more info: shortly I posted this review I got a message from the restaurant manager, Niel. He claimed that all the other customers are usually happy (not so sure about that after reading the rest of the reviews on Yelp) and that he will send me a gift certificate for all the inconvenience that we had. Asked for my email, so I provided. Guess what??! I never received it. It's been several months. I tried messaging back-no reply. Great service....not!!! I wish I could take that last star off.",

There weren't a lot of others at the bar, and the restaurant was not packed, but overall the vibe was pretty nice. The bar staff were attentive, and our group was taken care of nicely.  Even though we were not eating, nobody forced us out or bothered us to buy more stuff. Overall, I was very happy with the place and would recommend the bar to anyone.",

The pasta was delicious! Very flavorful and filled with lots of different types of seafood. The chocolate fondant was also extremely chocolate-y and just the right amount of richness. -The view. It was a beautiful day in SF, not too cold (which was great, since we had to sit on the patio because of my dog). The Bay Bridge was clearly visible and the sky was an incredibly shade of blue.  Cons: -The service. From the other Yelpers' reviews, I can tell that this wasn't an isolated incident. The hostess that sat us in the beginning led us to the back area, which I guess wasn't the patio where dogs were allowed. However, she didn't say anything to us, even though she clearly saw me with my dog and even commented on how cute she was. After she sat us, another staff member came over and informed us that dogs were not allowed in that area, and had us move to the patio. My mom got so upset with all the moving around that she wanted to leave and eat somewhere else. As a redeeming factor, one of the staff members brought out a dog bowl and filled it with water for Riley. -The price. If it weren't for the DAT menu, I probably wouldn't come here to eat, as it is otherwise quite expensive.  -L.",

I know that there was some special service given to me last night, however Waterfront Restaurant and Bar is an honest, and gracious restaurant.   On the evening of June 4th, 2011 a friend of mine and I dined here for my birthday and the evening could not have gone more perfect. Nick our waiter, was both humorous and attentive, which was sincerely appreciated. Neil and Ana, the managers are truly at the top of their game, their awareness of the floor is something others should strive for. My friend had the NY strip steak and I had the Crab Cakes with a Cesar Salad. The cuisine was what I was expecting and the one minor barely worth mentioning problem was too much dressing on the salad. Everything came out fresh, properly seasoned and hot, thank you kitchen staff. The ambiance of sitting out on the deck and watching the sunset and the lights come aglow over the bay bridge is breath taking. This is an average priced restaurant with first class service, not just for tourists.  I will continue to send my guests, especially my large parties here because I know I can count on them to make me look good.   Thank you again to Neil, Ana, Nick and the rest of the team last night who started my birthday celebrations off right. I look forward to many more years of doing business together!!",

It's the best restaurant in San Francisco, but then again it's not the worst. I've only been there twice, and both times my experiences were pretty okay.   The first time was for a party and it was held upstairs. The views were amazing and decor very tasteful. The second time was for Thanksgiving and we were seated at the covered (and heated) terrace facing the Bay Bridge.  As for the food. I loved the appetizers: lobster risotto and crab cakes (we had to order a second round of crab cakes). The risotto was creamy and not stingy on lobster at all. My family each ordered something different - as to taste what the restaurant had to offer. Their turkey was moist and flavorsome. The fish (I don't remember the name) was served with garlic butter mash potatoes, which was to die for. The salmon was good, nothing spectacular. As for desert - everything was so sweet and decadent that I felt bad ordering their desert sampler (apple tarte tatin, creme brulee, chocolate brownie, &amp; sticky toffee pudding) plus the chocolate fondant.  The prices may be a bit higher than your average restaurant, but pretty reasonable for the location, food, and service. Parking is limited to street parking and valet ($10). There is a garage across the street in the Embarcadero Center and a parking lot as well.",

Unless you happen to be within walking distance or near any of the various bus stops, this place has $14 valet parking, which isn't too bad for SF.  We made reservations for 8 but arrived around 7:40. We were asked to sit for a few minutes then were led straight to our table out on the covered pier. Our table faced the gorgeously lit up Bay Bridge and the financial district over the water. The views alone make this place worth it.  This was the first time I've ever been faced with two different knives and two different forks on either side of my plate and not known which goes with what. Lucky for means other uncultured swine, the waiters know and take away the unnecessary cutlery as the courses go by.  Everyone gets a choice of tap or bottled water, then the drink orders go out. As you're sipping on your wine out comes some tasty sourdough bread slices and butter. The soup and salads, if you decided to spend the extra $10 on one of those. And finally outcomes the main course. I had the vegetable linguini, which was delicious! Everyone else at my table chose sea bass or salmon and enjoyed their's as well. Though everything on their menu was at least $20+ and designed on their plates in such a way that are pretty and a tad on the smaller side that fancy places seem to like so much, I was comfortably full.  A special dessert menu is brought once the plates are cleared, coffee is offered, and drinks are constantly refilled without even needing to track down your waiter (who I must mention had a stereotypically French accent). The chocolate cake sounded too good to pass up, so I stuffed my face with it. It was perhaps THE best, most chocolatey thing I've ever eaten. At $9 a pop, the chocoholic in me was more than happy to pay.  Outside the covered pier is a walkway where you can take beautiful pictures of the bridge and the surrounding city, whether you're a tourist or not, it's a view worth checking out.",

The Waterfront has a nice view. \u00a0Nice staff. \u00a0Friendly Valet parking. \u00a0Nice Bar area, which, oh by the way has a pretty decent happy hour from what I could tell from their menu.  Other than that the food was just okay. \u00a0Nothing to brag about. \u00a0Perhaps if they had a more extensive Christmas day lunch menu it would of been better. \u00a0I do give them kiddos for nice presentation of food items.  My main issue was I ordered Prime Rib and wanted it rare and it was 1/2 rare and 1/2 well done. \u00a0The portion was HUGE and I think I was given 1/2 the cow but I wasn't looking for huge portions... I just wanted a nice piece of meat. \u00a0My mother ordered some sort of chicken that did smell good, and it came with polenta, however the polenta was a glob of dryness and just sat on the plate. \u00a0My sister had the salmon and I think she probably made the right choice since all of her food was gone and she seemed to enjoy and compliment the dish along the way.  Here is my thing... anyone who has to work on Christmas Eve or Christmas day deserves a big pat on the back, so there was NO freaking was I was going to complain. \u00a0Again, it wasn't bad, nor was it great... it just was.  I will try their happy hour one day when I take the ferry over for an afternoon.",

Our oysters were pre-shucked and stuck and withered in the shell. When we asked for a replacement we were told they were all like that and not to bother ordering more.  When my daughters eggs Benedict came out it was not warm, it was COLD. We were told they were pre-cooking them because it was so busy. I asked got another dish of eggs Benedict and the second dish was colder than the first. My wife's pasta dish was just a stuck together ball of linguini that was basically a big knot of partially cooked pasta. We didn't bother to eat it. My fish was an over cooked halibut that was tasteless and chewy. \u00a0We also had cold crab cakes and a nasty sticky cold corn soup.  The waiter told us it was a disaster everywhere. The general manager told me he was fed up listening to complaints and don't bother paying just leave if you want to.  And then we had to wait for 45 minutes at valet because they'd blocked our car in and a poor lady with a baby in one had and a baby on the way told us she had been there three hours and her kid was melting down  We went home and had left over Chinese that was ten times better than the crud they served up.

Semi outdoor patio area w/ heated lamps.   DAT menu.   1st- Bacon Clam Chowder and Salad- Both had its strenghts. Clam chowder was creamy, not oily not runny. Had a great taste of the smoked bacon. Salad was nice and crisp. The vinaigrette was quite flavorful. 2nd- Stuffed Chicken and the Ribs- Had the Ribs, which wasn't actually a rib. It was more like 2 pieces of pork steaks. It was squishy and so so soft and tender. You didn't need a knife to break at it. It tasted a bit like pulled pork, just not pulled.  3rd- Sorbet of the day and Chocolate Ganache.- Getting both is a good idea. Strawberry and coconut sorbet was amazing. Soooo good. The Ganache was perfect. The raspberry sauce that it sits on is amazing.   Bill- Almost $100.  Service- Meh. Had to ask for a spoon for the clam chowder. Wrong. Bussers were actually better than our waiter. He was MIA.  Drinks- Had champagne which was prefect and moderately priced.  Bread and Butter- Meh on the bread. Mmmm on the butter.  Ambiance- Oh so romantic.  Go back?- Maybe if I had a date and he paid.",

I come here a lot with my family when we have out of town guests visiting. The location, the decor, and the view are all amazing. As far as the food goes, it is your run-of-the-mill upscale seafood/steak restaurant. I'm not a seafood person, so it's possible that Waterfront offers worse seafood than you might expect from a place literally on the water. But the overall experience is very pleasant - dark comfortable dining room, cool upstairs area with fireplace, but sometimes a bit noisy. The steak and chicken never disappoint, and you can't really go wrong with the appetizers. But that's another thing - perhaps the menu is too safe. So I guess you're paying for a nice dining experience and reliably good (not great) food - it's San Francisco, get used to it!  Nice Embarcadero surf'n'turf restaurant for the spendy tourist.",

The bartender, an older gentleman who reminds me \"Heisenberg,\" right off the bat paid me no attention, even though there was only one other guy at the bar.  I asked for a simple old-fashioned with Knob Creek. I watched him make it and just knew it was going to be bad. First off, he used raw sugar instead of pure cane white sugar. If you're a sugar in the raw user, you know that it does not dissolve well. Next, he added cherries, an orange slice, what looked like half a dash of the bitters. He then muddled it all together, added the ice, and poured in the bourbon. He didn't even use a bartender wand to stir it, he used the pathetic sip straws they drop in when they give you the drink.  I can tell you right now, I'm pretty much eating this old-fashioned as I type this. The gritty sugar is coming up in every sip.  I'm giving this place two stars because their food is not too shabby but this is the worse bar to kick back at. Old-fashioned's should not be hard to make, every bartender should know how to make a decent one. It's the original cocktail which I'm sure is the first drink they teach you to make in bartender's school.  Moving on.",

Food The clam chowder which I like thick and creamy tasted thin and runny. \u00a0My b/f didn't find the crab cakes a major disappointment, and I probably would've liked them a little more had I not had to spit out crab shells every few bites (at this point, I was just a little relieved that they at least use real crabs!). \u00a0 After what seemed like another 20 minutes I asked another waiter to check on our main dishes - the salmon and sea bass plates are forgettable.  Summary * The food is not horrible, but it's not impressionable - the food is just mediocre.  * Service is border lining horrible - definitely room, lots of room for improvement here. \u00a0 I echo some people's sentiments - do not take anyone important here. \u00a0  * Prices are high for food and outrageous for service which the restaurant tries to compensate for with the view.",

We sat in a waiting area, where many other diners were waiting to be seated. We waited about 10 minutes, and then I went to speak with the host. We were told there were several parties ahead of us, waiting to be seated. I asked how this could be the case, since we had a reservation, arrived on time, \u00a0and we were there to celebrate a birthday.

We were definitely understanding about the holiday rush and computer issue, but if anyone had greeted us warmly, with a genuine apology, that would have made a big difference. It would have been very nice if the restaurant had offered everyone waiting a drink and/or appetizer, or perhaps a discount off a future visit.

I had seen the menu outside before, but didn't plan on going there due to the high prices. We were seated right away on the patio, which we were given a choice as to where we liked.  Thank goodness they have glass surrounding the patio, which helps cut the wind a bit, although it happened to be a very windy day, so things were blowing around a bit. The view of the bay is quite nice from there, some folks faced the water view directly, and we had a side view, which was fine for us. I'm a vegetarian, so I found the menu to be quite limited for my needs, but I was happy with my pear &amp; manchego cheese salad, and the mushroom/asparagus risotto. I ordered the appetizer portion, which was generous. I also had a mimosa, which wasn't listed on the cocktail menu, and it turned out to cost $12, which was too steep for me. The risotto is offered in two sizes, for $12 or $24. My dining companion wanted to have the sole sandwich, but our waiter told her they are out of the sole, and two other types of fish, so she was frustrated by that. He just shrugged and said that they don't get their full shipments on Sunday. In retrospect, I don't know if that's an acceptable answer, really. Why don't they stock enough fish, it is a seafood restaurant, after all!  She settled for the fish &amp; chips, reluctantly. It looked pretty good, she seemed to like it. As for the service otherwise, our waiter was nice and pleasant, and gave us extra time to take our orders. He seemed perhaps a tad aloof, not sure why. Later on, some woman came by to take my plate and then I ordered a cappucinno from her. I don't know why our waiter didn't ask if we would like dessert or coffee. He brought the check after, and said it's the end of his shift, in a way that I felt was just a touch impatient maybe. I don't think I will be back to the Waterfront again. My friend probably won't either. It's expensive and \u00a0you're just paying for the view primarily.",

After some strange wait for a table on the deck, we sat down and waited for menus for about 15 minutes.  We had the lobster risotto to start us off, which did not turn out as amazing as I had hoped for it to be. I had the wood oven roasted blue nose bass, and seeing as how this place serves predominantly seafood, it didn't quite cut it for me. For this price, you'd think that it would be leaps and bounds better than Pacific Catch!  As a whole, we had a good night there. Tranquil, with an amazing view of the bay, and a pretty delicious dessert mini sampler between us three. They weren't heavenly (though I personally really liked the sticky toffee pudding), but the company made it so much better.  Overall, it's overpriced and overrated. Service needs help, too. If you're really into seafood, you can find better restaurants elsewhere.",

I thought it would be nice and romantic and I didn't realize the Waterfront Restaurant would be the worst dining experience I've ever had.   We had reservations at 8:00. Got seated at 8:15. Waitress came to get our drinks at 8:30. Waitress brought drinks at 8:45 and took orders. 9:45 still no food (and yes I've complained 5x during this hour wait). 9:50 We get our appetizers- the scallops which are raw (no they aren't supposed to be cold and raw). 10:30 Appetizers and entrees come at the same time.   Besides for the fact that we waited a whole lot of time to get mediocre food, the waitress NEVER came to apologize or tell us what was happening. Every time I complained to the manager she offered me alcohol....Here's the thing about that: I look like I'm 16 and not a day over. I'm actually 22 but I look rather pre-pubescent. So I guess if you look young and actually are young go on a day the young female manager is working. Apparently you can get drunk for free.   Back to the dinner, the waitress insisted we order dessert so against my better judgment we did. They didn't even comp the terrible food. They comp'd the dessert.   Just don't go here. It's terrible and not worth the money.",

We were quickly seated on the patio. A few minutes later a man comes up to us and says he will be with us shortly. A few more minutes later a different man comes up and takes our drink order. We order two waters and a coke. The drinks come, we tell him we are ready. He says he will be right back, which is fine. We order. We both get two kobe cheeseburgers and my boyfriend gets the lobster mac n cheese. I ask for the lettuce, tomato, &amp; onion on the side. Our server asked \"what about the cheese?\" I told him that I wanted that on the burger.   Everyone around us is getting bread, except us. I have to flag down a buss boy and ask if we can have some bread... Strange... Finally someone else brings us our food later and my cheese isn't on the burger. The block of cheese is on the side, so I have to flag down our server and ask for them to melt the cheese on the beef... Finally it comes back out. We cut into our burgers and they were both medium-well. I ordered medium and my boyfriend ordered medium-rare. We were so hungry that we didn't say anything. Besides the burgers being over cooked, they were okay. I've had better, I've had worse. The one delicious thing was the bacon truffle aioli. I loved it!   Our server never once checked on us. We had to flag everyone down for anything we needed. \u00a0And it wasn't even that busy. Had to ask for my boyfriend's refill both times. Each time my boyfriend would finish his coke (an 8oz glass) we would line them up to see how long it would take someone to come buss our table. We had three empty coke glasses lined up before they came over. We also sat with our dirty plates in front of us for a good 10 minutes. I pushed them away and stacked them to see if someone would get the hint. Finally they came over and bussed our table. We also had to flag down our server and ask for the bill. Was it his first day??? And when we looked at our bill we got a pleasant surprise! (sarcasm) $10.50 for three cokes. I have NEVER been to a restaurant where you don't get free refills on soft drinks. And if this were the case, we should have been told about it beforehand. No wonder we weren't offered refills. $3.50 for an 8oz glass. Lol what a joke!  At this point, we had enough. I did mention this to my server. Walked up to him cause God knows we would never see him again if I didn't. He said \"Sorry about that, I should have told you before...\" Yeah! You should have. And you should have fixed this. Needless to say, he got a $2 tip on our $60 something bill. And the only reason he got a tip is because my boyfriend felt kind of bad. And thought it might be this guy's first day. I told him not to leave a penny. I am a server and he is a chef. The entire meal experience was unacceptable. When leaving, I wanted so badly to warn the people coming in to stay away. However, my manners got the best of me. Will never return or recommend everyone here. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before we walked in. The one time I don't it bites me in the a**.",

They point to an empty covered patio, nice view still but doesn't feel outside and theres definitely no sun.  We sit. Its takes a while for initial service. I think we came at a awkward time around 4:30 Id say, so the restaurant inside had a weird vibe to it. Finally a slightly agitated seeming server came to help us. He was good at his job but his vibe kinda matched the restaurants at the time. I originally wanted a shrimp or crab sandwich but we missed lunch here by that time and were presented with dinner menus. I ordered the flat iron steak for $32 with a side of the lobster mac&amp;cheese Steak was really small but just enough with the extra side. My boyfriend ordered the Handmade linguini which i tried and was delicious with a very light wine sauce just perfect, and seemed a really healthy size next to mine.

Beautiful view of the San Francisco waterfront, with a complementary nautical theme in the restaurant proper. Sure, it's no pineapple under the sea, but it feels like the deck of a sailboat or something. In terms of service and food, it falls far short of the standard it gives off. For my experience, the service was overall average, nothing spectacular but nothing horribly wrong. I got their handmade linguini, which was nice - though definitely not worth $20+. I'm not generally picky about my food, and I did eat the whole dish no problem, it just wasn't anything to devour with relish. I went with my family, who all agree that, while the food is okay, it is far overpriced. If it's your only option, don't sweat it it's an okay place, but there are definitely better alternatives (within walking distance) where you'll get a better bang for your buck.",

As I expected, he forgot my lobster mac &amp; cheese. I wish I had balls to say \"if you can't remember, write those down! \" He was nice but NOT GOOD. He brought it shortly, but he brought Lobster risotto. Then the other guy brought me a correct dish. Confused.  After all, lobster mac &amp; cheese was so tasteless I should've cancelled it.  Yelp reviews are not always right to your taste.   Crab cakes : 3 stars. Good but nothing special. Had a crab bone in it. Aioli was bland.  Manila clams : 4 stars. Good. Almost too much portion for appetizer. Came with burnt toasts  Lobster mac &amp; cheese : 1 star. Bland ! No cheese &amp; salt, \u00a0but cream  Carmel ice cream : 1 star. \u00a0Too sweet to me. Had bubbles cuz it's half way melted.   I split the bill w my friend who had Ahi tuna tar tar, Caesar salad, Asparagus, Sorbet and a glass of white wine, my share, w 15% tips, was $71.  Bottom line,\"overpriced\". \u00a0Everything should be at least 20% cheaper for these mediocre food. A typical tourist ripoff restaurant with wonderful location and view.   Thank God ! I found a street parking. Other wise, I would've spent another $14 (valet parking) for this dinner !  By the way, to the management of the restaurant, was our bill included gratuity ? \u00a0We forgot to pay attention to it. Now I suspect if we added 15% extra tip for the bad service to our already gratuity added bill.",

We served a variety of hor'dourves, the Sabucca prawns were our favourites; we also served wine and beer.  The reason I'm only giving them a three is that the entire week before the wedding they really had me stressed out. Probably my fault for not being a more picky and anal-retentive bride. I should have double, even triple checked our requests weeks in advance to avoid last minute confusion. When my mom got into town three days before the wedding I asked her to work out the details with the event coordinator. In the end, it all worked out.  I kinda feel like we paid too much to just rent the upstairs room, but that was our fault for agreeing to pay it. And I get the feeling that's just how it is in this city. Compared to some of the other venues we checked out, the Waterfront was a steal!  The upstairs room is beautiful and simple, with large windows on all sides, it didn't need much sprucing up, which is one of the main reasons we chose it. The sunset was spectacular and I think all of our guests appreciated the views.  In the end, the staff, the food and the views made it worth the price and the stress.",

She kept forgetting to bring my wine that I ordered. And even once, she asked me, \"Do you want a drink?\" after I had already ordered one! I mean, how hard is it to pour wine? I also thought she did not look professional in the sense that she was working a very nice restaurant - she had WAY too much eye makeup on. At one point during the dinner, I overheard her and another diner arguing. But the rudest thing she did was when we paid our bill, she OPENED it in front of us and counted out the money/tip to make sure it was \"enough\", then she nodded her head to us and said, \"Okay, have a good night!\" That was so damn rude. I've never experienced something like that before.   I'm sure I would've loved dining here even more if we had a different server. Aside from that, the food was DELICIOUS. I eat chicken a lot at restaurants, but the chicken breast from the Dine About menu was the juiciest chicken I ever had!! I definitely don't regret ordering that. My friend ordered a side of the mashed potatoes, and it was served to her COLD. I told her to send it back, but she was worried that the crazy waitress would spit in it or something. I also had the prawn for an appetizer on top of the prix fixe dine-about menu. OH, do you know what sucked about this place? They couldn't provide HALF of their appetizer menu because their oven was \"broken\". Sorry, but I've never been somewhere that didnt' offer a lot of food that is ON the menu. Do you know how bad it is for a restaurant to say, \"Sorry, but our [whatever] is not working, so we can't serve that.\" Well, get it fixed!  The views were amazing. That's just about it. I felt so awkward there. Mmmm, that chicken...",

The soup was okay, it tasted very fresh and the corn added a nice texture. The pasta was excellent, loaded with crab, mussels, clams, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. All was well until we finished eating and sat there for nearly 45 minutes while our waitress disappeared to god knows where, we had to ask a bus boy to wrap up our leftovers and then ten minutes later she reappears and doesn't offer us dessert, we have to ask for a menu. We decided to get the sticky toffee pudding to which her response was, \"okay, you know it's british and it's not actually a custardy-pudding, right?\" So first everything is good and now the one thing that we are sure about she doesn't want us to get? this is just weird. needless to say, i would go back here only if they improve their service standards.",

As we looked at another restaurants menu an mulled over the food and whether to keep walking, another couple behind us stepped in and said \"we just ate at the Waterfront and it was really delicious.\" Okay, well let's go take a gander we can always walk back. We walk over and their menu had many wonderful looking seafood choices, so we stepped in and just hoped we wouldn't have to wait too long. They seated us immediately right by the window, with this amazing view of the bay bridge. The restaurant was white tablecloth and well lit with natural light, and a beautiful view in front of us. The wait staff was super attentive and got us water and drinks and got us started with our crab cakes appetizer very quickly.  Now those crab cakes may look small but they were pure fresh crab meat heaven! Really perfect and delicious and one each was actually plenty (not to mention we had both dived into the lovely french bread).  I ordered a Crab Louie Salad that came with a cut up hard boiled egg and olives, and tomato and of course lots of fresh crab. It was so wonderful and fresh and just a lovely meal. My husband had a seafood fettuccine, which he equally enjoyed. We didn't have room for desert, since all the crab was very filling.  The whole meal experience really lovely and could be a great place for a special occasion or family event. Also it was hard to choose what to order being so many wonderful fresh fish options you can't just get anywhere.  I'd love to come back here again, thank you stranger's for the suggestion!",

Getting a seat that quickly on weekend evening without reservations is probably a bad sign for a restaurant that wants to be taken seriously.   The service was ok, but our food took a while to arrive. Hard to say if that's because of the kitchen or the waiter. The price to portion ratio is ridiculous.

The \"cauliflower soup\" was nothing but tasteless potatoe soup sprinkled with a few miniscule califlower florets. Ths salmon was grilled to flavorless dried fish, served over well (and I medan well) cooked fingerling potatoes over tough leeks. Yuk! All this for nearly $100 including ice tea and tip (it wasn't the waiter's fault). We should have left! Never again!",

Clams were flavorful; fries hot and crisp; and oysters fresh, thin and perfectly briny. Portions are pretty small so it won't ruin dinner as long as you're sharing. Definitely recommend this place for a relatively quick bite in the late-afternoon if you're in the area and want to get away from the always-crowded Ferry Building.

The service - \u00a0It was horrible and our waitress kept making mistakes on our orders, and we had to keep on asking her for things that she forgot to bring over and over again. At the end of the meal, our waitress dissapeared........she was nowhere to be found for about 20minutes. She finally showed up at the very end of the meal to give us our bill. Too bad tip was already included, or else I'd tip her under the avg tip rate.  The food - The food was bad, it was horrific and most of all, it was holy hell wat the heck is this crap i put in my mouth? The Calamari was bad, it was had no taste whatsoever and all you can slightly taste is the lime on it. The shrimp was just salty, you can't taste the bacon nor the shrimp. All you can taste was just salt salt salt and o yeah, salt. I had the Oven Chicken and it was just okay, but again it was really really salty and it didn't really have much flavor on it. My friend had the bass and it tasted like nothing, it had no taste whatsoever. No problem, just dip it in the butter sauce.......................it tastes like water now. He ended up asking for tartar sauce for his fish because it was just so bland and tasteless. The portion was really really small, so if you're going in hungry, you're probably comming out hungry. Don't expect a lot of food, it's really tiny portions and it's basically nothing. One person ordered the Lobster and all he got was a small lobster head and the tail, which has very little meat on it, and you know how much that costed him? $75............$75!! Now price is nothing if tastes good and it has a good quality to it, but it had no flavor, nothing, nada, uh uh, what is flavor? The chef should be hung by his balls for making tasteless pricey food.  Overall - Overall this place sucks and i will not go there ever again, not even if it was the last restaurant on earth. I'd rather eat rocks then go to that restaurant ever again, because it was lame. The only good thing that came outta there was the hot chicks (i always write about hot chicks) and yes they were hot. Also, watching the Warriors vs Lakers game, which the Warriors won was also good. But other then that, stay away from this place, you'll just come out angry and unsatisfied.

We waited for about 15 minutes and then we had to ask the guy who filled out water glasses to flag our waiter. The waiter walked up and robotically said he was sorry for our long wait.

Crab cakes: \u00a0The texture was a little bit dry, but the crab seemed fresh and the taste was good. \u00a0The sauce was a little spicy but good.  Black angus NY steak: \u00a0The quality of the meat was hard to determine since they overcooked it. \u00a0We asked for medium, but it came back well-done. \u00a0The pommes frites that came with it was very well done and was a good compliment to the steak.

I did not have any entrees, as it was hor dourves all night long, but the only thing that stood out for me was the lobster mac and cheese (but as a mac n cheese lover, this is hardly ever wrong in my book) that came in shot glasses and the crab cake which is pretty standard everywhere. They had a couple stations, and I started off with the raw oysters and they had huge shrimps! they also had a sushi station and grabbed some sliced tuna with sauce as well. The oysters were majorly dissapointing. Being in SF, you expect it to be fresh and great. But since they were pre-shucked, they were majorly dry. The sushi, the fish just did not taste fresh, and I wonder if it's because it may have sat out for a bit, and quite flavorless. They had a slider station as well, and the meat was as dry as can be. Fail.   Service was great, waiters were constantly coming by and offering the hor dourves, as well as glasses of champagne and mojitos. Props to them, as the place was packed with hundreds of people in the packed space downstairs. The chicken skewers with peanut sauce came around the most and I nibbled on one, it was alright. Bruschetta had cilantro, yuck! who puts cilantro in brushcetta?! Was there a basil shortage? There was another thing I tried that was not good as well but cannot remember what was inside. Cheese quesadilla was standard. On the second floor, there was another slider station and cheese and fruits table. No thanks.   The very top floor had a live band playing, so it was quite loud to chat, although this was the least crowded floor. Here, was an assortment of desserts. I was happy to see the fruit tarts, but they were just okay, which is hard to mess up. The chocolate covered chocolate cheesecake was too rich for me, but the creme brulee was excellent.  The bartenders were a bit rude, and the shot glasses are TINY. maybe 1/3 of a shot that you'd get elsewhere. But maybe they were doing this on purpose since it was open bar. Still, dissapointing to wait and wait to get a tiny shot.  The coat check and valet area was busy busy busy, yet they held their patience, and did a really great job. All in all, a successful event, but I left a bit hungry...",

The waitress wasn't meeting to par, however. \u00a0I was hard to get my order across, and it sort of distracted us from what was going on. \u00a0Also, there were about 4 waiters bussing our table! \u00a0So, our table was almost always cleaned, cleared, filled, and refilled. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0We ordered the crab and lobster, and both were all right. \u00a0I'd prefer to get some from pier 39 and watch the men crack the crab for us then dip it in butter. \u00a0I got some cajun sauce, and it wasn't that great. \u00a0I stole my date's butter instead :) \u00a0The good side, since it was so empty that night, when I made my order very particular and specific (I wanted to substitute something for mashed potatoes) I got what I wanted, and my date got an extra side as well. \u00a0Maybe it was because there was a communication problem...Maybe I'll just get a burger or steak next time.  Our bill came about to be $180 for the two of us. \u00a0Now, THAT is not worth it. \u00a0I advise those who LOVE view over food to come here. \u00a0This is very \u00a0much a touristy restaurant, so it's nice for a once in a life time sort of meal, but other than that, there are plenty of other restaurants around the Embarcadero where wining, dining, and viewing are just as wonderful.  Lastly, a pier/dock that goes over the water in between pier 7 and 5 allows you to take a nice stroll and take wonderful photos of the bay bridge and old fashioned boats that are docked near by. \u00a0It's conveniently next to the restaurant :)",

If you want a front seat view of the firework display at the pier, but without the crowds, this IS the place to be! \u00a0  After a long night of unsuccessfully trying to find a bar or club that might be decent but wouldn't charge an out of proportion cover fee, we landed in front of Waterfront Restaurant. \u00a0A fancy looking place like this HAD to have a bar (afterall, that's all we wanted), and if this restaurant was anything like the fancy LA restaurants I'm used to back in my hood, then we stood a good chance of being able to go in to just sit at the bar and drink without the necessity of a reservation or cover fee... and I was right. Hooray! Having saved money on not having to pay cover charges, my friend splurged on some delicious sauvignon blanc (per recommendation of the bartender) and great champagne.   Two minutes before midnight, the staff opened up their balcony in the back to allow patrons to view the firework show. \u00a0We were absolutely shocked by how close we were to the launch site of the fireworks. I mean, you could SEE the people who were setting the fireworks off! On top of that, there was the lovely view of the bridge in the background. \u00a0An amazing end to 2009.",

There is easy valet parking, but I recomend parking across the street if you drive, it will save you a couple bucks and a tip.  The restaurant itself it beautiful. I loved the setting and the ambiance of this restaurant. The lighting was soft, there was gentle music playing, and dark rich woods throughout. We sat by the window and would have had a beautiful view of the bay had it not already been dark out.  All of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. I order the lobster risotto and my boyfriend ordered the seafood grill. Mine was absolutely amazing. Quality risotto made with fresh Main lobster for $22, a few bucks above normal, but I expected it with the location of the restaurant. I'm sad to say my boyfriend was far less satisfied with his meal. The mxed seafood grill was pretty much 3 pieces of grilled fish with \u00a0white cream sauce on the side. Pricetag - $28. We also inquired about the surf n' turf, which turned out to be $65.  All in all this was a good experience, though most menu items were very overpriced, but what do you expect from a restaurant on the Embaradero. I'd return with out of town guests for the ambiance and view, maybe for the bar with my boyfriend, but there are better places to eat for less money in the city.",

This review has nothing to do with the food at Waterfront. \u00a0This is because we had no food at Waterfront after sitting for one and a half hours for lunch today. \u00a0Allow me to explain.  The lunch began normally. \u00a0We were seated promptly, drink orders taken, specials explained, and food orders taken. \u00a0One of the members of our party of nine came about forty five minutes after we were seated (work is a harsh mistress) and tried to order some food. \u00a0At this point, we discovered that the order for our table was never put in to the kitchen.  It turns out that our waiter, who seemed fine when helping us out, suddenly became sick and left the restaurant without telling anyone, and also without putting our order in. \u00a0I found this completely bizarre; if he left without saying anything, how did the management know he was sick? \u00a0And if he did tell management that he was sick, why wouldn't management try to follow up on the tables he was working? \u00a0The fact that we discovered this failure through complete chance, i.e., our late dining companion, is unacceptable.  So a new waitress comes by the table to retake our orders. \u00a0Not only is she completely unapologetic, she is complaining about how she was called in early to work. \u00a0Uh, right . . . \u00a0The person heading the lunch politely asks if she could bring out some appetizers for the table, seeing how we had been sitting around for an hour with no food. \u00a0The waitress replied that the only thing she could do was put in our order as quickly as possible. \u00a0Uh, what?  Head lunch person is unhappy, and goes to talk to the owner of this establishment. \u00a0The owner was very apologetic and said that the kitchen and staff would make sure we would be served promptly. \u00a0Cool.  We wait for another half hour. \u00a0Nothing has come out, not even fucking lobster chowder that one only has to ladle out of a pot into a bowl, and then serve. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0During the entire time, we have one drink refill, and only because we asked. \u00a0And the person refilling spilled iced tea all over the feet of two people and a Marc Jacobs bag. \u00a0Said person didn't even say a word of apology. \u00a0After this half hour, we inquire as to the status of our food. \u00a0\"The kitchen has just gotten started.\" \u00a0Thanks, but no thanks. \u00a0The owner again was very apologetic for the delay and understood why we were walking out. \u00a0Our waitress, not a single word of anything.  Thanks for stealing an hour and a half of my life. \u00a0At least we were able to salvage the lunch by rolling to Taylor's and mobbing down on burgers, sweet potato fries, and sweet, sweet shakes.",

Once we got in, they seated us almost right away and sat us at a table with a view. \u00a0Perfect! \u00a0I hope you don't forget the dessert! \u00a0I asked my friend to ask the manager again about the dessert and she rudely responded with \"Yes, I spoke with you about it over the phone. \u00a0We have it noted\". \u00a0Again I ask, REALLY? \u00a0She didn't speak with her...she spoke with me! \u00a0And ultimately, guess what? \u00a0They forgot the dessert so we reminded her again! \u00a0Oh man...they BETTER comp the dessert!   While ordering our drinks, the waitress proceeded to recommend a different wine from our original every single time. \u00a0I get that she was trying to recommend something that others prefer, but \u00a0I'm sorry...do you know what we like? \u00a0She also made a not so nice comment to one of us...I think she mistook joking for being inappropriate. \u00a0  See...what sucks about this place is that they have decent food. \u00a0The calamari was good, but they didn't offer any appetizer plates for us to eat it with and they took the plates away before we were even finished with it. \u00a0What? \u00a0Why? \u00a0The Lobster Risotto was good with lemony chunks of lobster, the NY Steak was thick and cooked perfectly (Although the NY Steak came way after the other dishes because they overcooked the first one). \u00a0The Kobe Stuffed Cheeseburger was okay, but the Truffle BACON Aioli was amazing! \u00a0Does your mind change about the food when the service is spotty at a fancy-schmancy establishment?  When the check came, they comp'd some items off the list, but this leads me to wonder...Do they resort to comp'ing something off everyone's meal because their service sucks so bad?",

I have never received such bad service from someone in the food service industry, let alone from a \"manager.\" Me and 7 of my friends went to San Francisco for Fleet Week and decided to stop for food around 2:30 in the afternoon. We were originally greeted by the kind and gracious hostesses who told us we were going to have to wait an hour for a table but that we could pass the time in their cocktail lounge. If you have been here, you know their cocktail lounge is small and right next to the hostess stand. When I turned to walk over to the cocktail lounge, the so-called \"manager\" put his hand in my face and said he did not have room for me there. I replied that perhaps he should speak to the hostess because she just directed us to wait over here. He then proceeded to stomp over to the hostess stand and yell at one of the poor girls that there was no room for me and my friends. The bar stools were taken in the cocktail lounge but there was NO ONE standing and there was additional seating on a bench directly across from the bar. The \"manager\" then stormed outside to presumably yell at someone else.   The hostess apologized to us and then told me that we could order from the bar and then sit on the bench. When the \"manager\" saw that we were standing next to the bar he came in screaming at us yelling at us asking whether we had heard him and that he didn't have room for us. I simply asked him why he was being so rude and then he proceeded to scream at me while waving his hands in my face and kick all of us out. He refused to give us his name; he said that he was the only manager and that he didn't have a business card. We asked the hostesses what his name was but they couldn't give it to us, which I understand because they don't want to lose their jobs.  I use to work in the food industry and have never seen someone act so atrociously to customers. We were such a large group that would have spent a lot of money but instead we were treated like we weren't good enough to eat there.

Embarrassing, for everyone.  The kicker came when my mother felt something run over her foot, and I looked under the table, and was absolutely shocked to see a rat scamper off under the table next to us.

The bacon was incredibly fatty and cheap. The tuna was nearly rare in the middle, which might be ok if it was good tuna. This was not good tuna. And the sauce sort of finished you off with a terrible taste in your mouth.  \u00a0The view of the Bay Bridge is nice, especially at night. This is probably a better place to go for a drink, not dinner.  \u00a0It did seem like the place was staffed and run by South Asians, probably Indian. Why not turn this into an Indian restaurant? Heck, even vegetarian. There's nothing like that on the wharfs....and Indian place with a spectacular view. There might be more passion behind the food then.",

Fancy restaurant with k-mart fans for display. Classy!  My lobster sandwich was delicious with huge chunks of lobster inside. It was messy to eat since the sauce quickly soaked the bread and made it soggy. You get a generous portion of salad on the side as well. I also had the crab mashed potatoes and you can definitely taste the crab. It was quite good as well.   Overall, I had a good experience with the food and service was good.

It took about 15 mins for our waitress to come out and greet us. We asked if she could turn the heater on and she said no problem. Then 10 min later she came back to take our order. I asked again about the heater and she said no problem. We waited 30 min and not only did no one come to light the heater we watched 2 of the tables around us get bread- we didn't. Finally our appetizers came and I had to ask that gentleman to turn on the heater. The food was eh.

It's not a culinary masterpiece, but it's still delicious. I enjoyed the crab cakes and the calamari and popcorn shrimp dish. The cocktails here are hand crafted and fresh squeezed. In addition, the prices are very comparable for the dining location, quality of food and overall experience.

I was surprised he could have so much character and charisma with the table next to us but was dry as a piece of chalk when he took our order and our drinks.   We ordered an arnold palmer, they put a sparkling lemonade, I almost want to say it was the San Pellegrino kind, it was yummy but extremely tart. For an appetizer, we had the calamari, very good! The dipping sauce was spicy and a really nice surprise. I also asked for a side of tartar sauce which was just as good. Entree- I had the seabass grilled with the lemon/caper &amp; parsley butter sauce. The sauce was really good but I was a bit disappointed with the fish. For a seabass, I expected it to be more tender. My beau had the seafood cioppino, omg, that was de-lish! They paired it with toasted buttered sourdough bread... heaven!

Happy hour is only available at their bar area, as well as their \"lounge area,\" (but that's how it is for most restaurants). \u00a0I would have loved to sit on the patio area, but I was all about those 99 cent oysters. \u00a0The bar was full, so we sat in their lounge, which wasn't much of a lounge, but still comfortable. \u00a0I wish there was a better view of the bay from where we were.  I couldn't stop ordering oysters. \u00a0They were just ask delicious as the ones we had at the Ferry Building earlier, and much cheaper. \u00a0Along with the oysters, we ordered the clams in white wine/garlic sauce ($5), truffle fries (they were either $3 or $5), and a glass of sparkling wine ($5) off of the happy hour menu. \u00a0All the prices were very reasonable... I believe no more than $5, yet the quality was great. \u00a0The clams were delicious; I drank all the sauce like it was soup. \u00a0My bf also ordered a bowl of clam chowder off of the regular menu ($9), which had included of bacon bits (yum).  Service was very friendly. \u00a0We were originally told by the hostess to order up at the bar if we were to sit in the lounge. \u00a0When we did, one of the bartenders told us to relax and he would come over and take care of us.  Overall, a very pleasant evening after a long day of walking around. \u00a0I haven't tried the main dinner menu here yet, but if it's anything like the happy hour, then I'm down!",

I had   -three dozen of the oysters priced at 99 cents each -baked oysters for $5 -clams with chili, white wine, &amp; garlic for $5 -beer battered onion rings $4 -truffle parmesan fries $3  Everything on the happy hour menu that my friends and I ordered was good. The fries and clams seemed like a small portion to me but for under $5 I guess that's all you get. Our server was very nice and made sure our drinks were always filled and we didn't have to ask for another beer when needed. The oysters were wonderful and presented well on a huge ice tray. I think it's best that you come for their happy hour because it's really worth it. I have yet to come and try their other menu items but for now, the 99 cent oysters will suffice!",

OK, not great. Probably would not order it off the menu. Then I had the mussels... the sauce was good, so were the fries. But nothing great. Service was lacking. The first thing I thought when I got the bill was \"that meal was not worth that much\".   The view is great. Decor is nice, ambience is pleasant. I just feel like this place could be (and should be) so much better. I just felt overall, like they weren't trying... weren't trying with the service, the food, anything. For a place in that location with the prices that they charge, you should have an overall great experience there, and it was mediocre. I don't think I'll be going back...",

They won't give you the Dine About Town menu until you specifically ask for it by the way.

    "review_text": "We came here to have a nice dinner and it was a dinner - nothing about it was particularly bad, but there wasn't really anything particularly good either, hence an average rating.  Food: 3/5 I ordered the lobster risotto for my appetizer. It had plenty of flavor and a lot of lobster, they used a LOT of cream in the risotto - cream should not be in risotto, all the \"creaminess\" is supposed to be from the starch releasing from the rice grains. It was also very large for an appetizer, which made me unable to finish my entree. I had the seafood linguine for my main course, and it was decent - good flavors and plenty of seafood, although the shrimps were a bit small and overcooked. The linguine was cooked al-dente which was good, but unfortunately I was too full to finish, or order dessert.  Service: 4/5 Service was not inattentive, but definitely tended towards the slow side of things. The servers and busboys were friendly and polite in general though.   Ambience: We were seated on the second floor. My theory is that the building used to house a Chinese restaurant of some sort, because all the chairs and decor had an Asian theme to it - wooden partitions and bamboo chairs. While it was still tasteful, it gave the restaurant a slightly confused vibe.   Overall, although there's nothing truly bad about this restaurant, in my opinion you can get tastier food for cheaper - at the prices they charge, I was expecting some more innovative dishes and a generally higher level of service.",

It was hot on that Saturday and the night was absolutely clear and warm. We were seated on the corner of the outer room and we have an unobstructed view of the lit bay bridge and the rising moon. So romantic.....  We ordered the crab cake as appetizer and it came out amazing fast, probably a minute after they gave us the bread. You can just tell that it was something that they made ahead and just heated through. The presentation wasn't too exciting but I liked it regardless because of they were really generous with the crab meat. BTW, after eating the grilled bread from Pisces in Sunset, plain old bread will never make it anymore. I had the Seabass with lemon caper sauce. I could care less about the sauce because the fish was better by itself. The crab mashed potatoes were pretty interesting. I loved the texture of crab meat in mashed potatoes but I thought it could've been more flavorful. My bf's angus steak was humungo. It came with garlic fries and bacon string beans. I can't stand the taste of bloody red meat so I didn't try it.   Most of the waiters there were older folks that had a hard time remember what the special of the night was. It was a bit slow for them to get to our table although there were people in only 1/4 of the restaurant. The whole place wasn't as fancy as I imagined it to be. The food was definitely a bit disappointing. The best thing of the night was being able to spend time w/ my bf. That in itself is priceless.",

Right off the bat, $10 to park in their little valet lot... more on this later. We did have reservations for four, but the place was not crowded at all. We were seated right away. The view is incredible! Too bad it was overcast. The staff is very courteous, friendly and attentive. Two brunch specials ($20. ea) were ordered that had granola &amp; fruit with cream to start, then a single halved sausage served with a egg &amp; mushroom scramble. Sorbet &amp; coffee... nothing really exciting. I ordered the fried calamari appetizer($11), which was really tender and seasoned really great, and the fish and chips entree. This order was pathetic... a bed of battered fries and onions, with five or six fish nuggets on top and a little cup of malt vinegar. $16 bucks! I did have the fore sight to order a side of crab mashed potatoes ($6) which was totally awesome. They use real crab, not crab with a \"K\". They kept the french bread (sliced baggets, kinda hard) coming... and the coffee was excellent. The servers did keep getting the plates mixed up on who ordered what... there were only four of us. All in all, this place charges waaaaay too much (brunch for four... $140.00) for service that could be better, and food that's just average.  About the valet parking... you pull up, the guy backs in to the spot like 10 feet away for you. When you come back, he asks you what car you have (yeah, I could've said the Big Silver Lexus, but...) then he pulls it out of the space for you, a car length or so. (wow!)

My GF always gets the Cioppino and we always compare it to the many others we tried. I had the special which was a sea bass entree. I had to dock a star due to the price per portion ratio. My sea bass could have been a bit more tender. As far as the Cioppino, we had so many, and each restaurant always seems to have their own rendition of it. No complaints here at the \"Waterfront\", except that portion could be bigger. Especially since Scoma's not that far away has a HUGE serving, yet still very high quality and tasty, for just a tad bit more.   Despite my complaints, I would certainly dine here again.   **NOTE** This restaurant participated in Dine About Town SF 2011. $34 per person for 3 course meal. Cioppino of course was an option.

    "review_text": "It was a a beautiful sunny day in San Francisco, so we opted to sit outside and enjoy the view. \u00a0I think that was the best part.  We came for brunch and found the menu to be more lunch focused than brunch. \u00a0I asked for the shell fish omelette to be made vegetarian and ordered a side of bacon. \u00a0My husband got the crab sandwich and I had the bloody mary.   The omelette was nice, the veggies in it were great but the cheese on top, was cheddar, they didn't have goat cheese or feta and instead of working it into the dish it was melted on top, looked very amateur. \u00a0The crab sandwich was OK but the bread was greasy, my husband was not a fan. \u00a0The bacon was terrible, it was huge pieces, it wasn't crispy and was all fat. \u00a0I asked them to redo it and the same result the second time.  Then the bill came, OK I don't like to nickel and dime it but they charged the full $22 for the omelette even though there was no shell fish in it and charged $5 for the bacon that I clearly didn't like or eat really even after they redid it.  For our lunch we paid $60, not worth it, we've had much better meals for less and I expect much better for this price and this caliber of restaurant. \u00a0There are much better options within walking distance with the same view.",

    "review_text": "I've eaten here 15 or 20 times over the years. In the past I found the food to be good, and the location and decor is great. \u00a0Its a tad pricey - so I usually reserved it for business lunches, often with out of town guests. I've also recommended it to quite a few friends.  My favorite dish by a long shot is their lobster risotto. \u00a0At its best it us a sublime mix of rice, lobster, enriched broth with a great lemon overtone. One of those dishes you think about for a while and pine to try again.  Today my wife and I were going to catch a quick lunch but decided that since it was such a lovely day we would drive down to the Embarcadero and get the risotto. To say it was a comedy of errors would be an overstatement, but they were definitely out of gear. Our waiter was very pleasant, but he admitted it was his second day on the job. \u00a0He did do a very nice job of fixing our tippy table. \u00a0  We ordered a beet salad to share, my wife got the lobster risotto, and I got the daily special which was the lobster risotto with fresh scallops.  I ordered two glasses of white wine - an unusual actually white (not blush) Grenache for the wife, and a dry Riesling for me. \u00a0I was a bit surprised that by the Riesling since it was actually off dry - it had a bit of \u00a0residual sugar and a \u00a0slightly dried fruit taste. Probably not the best choices (a Sauv. Blanc would have been better), but I like to try interesting wines.  Service was spotty at best. \u00a0The bread guy showed up, and never came back. \u00a0More troubling, the food was brought out by runners who had no idea who ordered what. I'll admit that this is a pet peeve for me, but we are not talking about Denny's here. This is a pretty expensive restaurant. and they don't understand the basic step of numbering the seats at each table so a runner doesn't have to ask \"Who had the crab cakes?\"   The beet salad was the first real letdown. The microgreens were great, the beets tasty, and the shaved cheese on top was great. \u00a0But the dressing was actually just oil. There was no acid - vinegar or citrus - to balance the fat. \u00a0A small thing but it made definitely took away from the dish.  Anyway, here is where things go downhill. \u00a0My wife's lobster risotto came out. My dish didn't. \u00a0Eventually I tried hers, and it was nothing like it had been the last 5 or 6 times I had it. \u00a0It was gummy, overcooked, and too cheesy. \u00a0There was very little lemon to balance the richness. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't a $28 lunch entree either. \u00a0  My order was forgotten. \u00a0After a bit the hostess came over and asked if I was still waiting for my dish. I said \"yes\" and she took off to see to it. \u00a0A small plate of (excellent) smoked salmon appeared with no explanation. \u00a0It was a \"tide-me-over\" until they got my dish out. A nice gesture to be sure, but it would have been better if the waiter or one of the hosts delivered it with an explanation, rather than just having a runner pop it on my table.  About 10 minutes later my dish finally appeared. The underlying risotto was the same as my wife's. \u00a0The scallops were clearly extremely fresh and of the best quality. They were, unfortunately, extremely salty and a dash undercooked. \u00a0I also got a big mouthful of cold gloppy risotto on one bite, which pushed me over the edge and I just slid the dish away from me.  A different host came over to enquire and I was honest with him. He was very polite and apologetic. \u00a0Indeed, while the meal was a bit of \u00a0a travesty food-wise, the folks handled it well and with good humor. I guess it helped that I was in a good mood and wasn't pissy about it.  They offered to bring a new entr\u00e9e, but I was pretty well finished. We did take them up on a complementary desert (they actually offered for both of us but we split one not wanting to be piggish.) \u00a0The almond cake was very tasty and had a great crumb, but was a bit dry and would have done well with a sabayon or other sauce (there was some whipped cream which helped.) \u00a0But as I said, the cake was extremely tasty and I didn't leave any behind.   Oh, and the first cup of coffee was cold. The second cup was fine.  I didn't scrutinize my bill, but I'm sure they took something off for my trouble, in addition to the free desert. For two glasses of wine, a salad, two entrees, a desert and a cup of coffee, with tax, they charged us $80. \u00a0I rounded up to $100, wanting to be a good sport about it.  So, what to make of this? \u00a0Was the meal worth $100 with tip? \u00a0Not a chance. \u00a0They clearly messed up (the host told us the chef had taken a day off for a change - which helps explain things.) but they also did their best to remedy the situation.  I'll give them another shot, if only because I love that lobster dish so much. But this is a case of two strikes and you are out. If things don't' improve a lot the next time will be our last. \u00a0Pity",

    "review_text": "Let's just start off by saying that my favorite part of the meal was the bread and butter.  Sitting by the water was nice. Waiters were pleasant, however we hardly saw our head waiter and it wasn't even busy. The one who tended the most to us was the guy who got us more bread &amp; water.  We ordered 2 bloody mary's to start. Nothing special - still had to add pepper and salt. Couldn't even tell if it had any vodka!! I love bloody marys. This was probably in the worst 3 that I've had. I had to force myself to finish it.  i ordered a potato leek soup - the soup the day. It was quite bland and not hot. When i got it there was a layer/film on top...as if it had been sitting out for a while. My boyfriend made this soup much better at home. His tasted more fresh also. He ordered the calm chowder which also came out with that top layer/film and was not hot. Didn't taste terrible...but it was the first time I've had a sweet clam chowder.  He ordered the fried sole for his main dish. We expected it to be crispy but it was not. (Points for the waiter who asked if he wanted them to de-bone tableside.) He had to order a side dish of spinach because it didn't come with any sides. Spinach was average - garlic sauted .  My main dish was the braised short ribs. I'm used to the meat just falling off because it's so tender. This one was full of fat and I still had to use my knife. Seasoning not particularly tasty. The potatoes we average. I did not like the sauce. The best part of this meal was the crispy baby carrots.  We opted out of ordering dessert after all these disappointments.  Then, to top it off, we got a bill which included an added 4% for the workers healthcare. Needless to say, we only gave them an 11% tip. (15% total if you include their \"healthcare tip\")  We made a last minute decision to eat here &amp; we will definitely not be back...",

BF ordered the seafood pasta, and I ordered the daily prix fixe menu--cold asparagus soup, steak entree, and chocolate fondant. Honestly, I was expecting better. The soup was kind of weird-tasting. The steak was adequate, but I've had better. The pasta was also okay. Seems like expensive doesn't always equal great, quality food! However, the desserts were good. We also ordered creme brulee.

They greeted and seated us immediately and took our drink orders right away. We had two small children with us and they offered right away some off-menu choices for the kids and offered to bring it any time we wanted. The table was upstairs with stunning views of the water and Bay Bridge lights (which was our prerequisite for my mom's dinner and Water Bar and most other places along the Embarcadero could not accommodate a group our size.)  I got their salad with balsamic, the crab cakes and clam chowder. All were very good. Crab cakes had a light fresh taste. And while the clam chowder tasted more like potato chowder to me, it was good and honestly that would be the one thing I would say could use improvement.)  All at the table seemed to enjoy their food. Service was excellent. A couple waiters for our large table and constant attention refilling our water and bread.   AND, they did NOT automatically include gratuity which we were certain they would do for a group our size. Overall, a great place for a large group with attentive service, good food and extraordinary views in a great /convenient location just at the end of Broadway at the Embarcadero.  Would return. Their bar area w/ couches looked comfortable and we saw quite a few groups of friends gathering who also seemed to be enjoying themselves.",

For $$$, I expect a very decent meal and Waterfront was just not up to par.   The service was really slow at the beginning. My party definitely sat and talked for a while before we got to order. The service during the rest of the dinner was a little faster.   I got the clam chowder and seafood linguini while most of the people in the rest of my party got the petrale sole. The clam chowder was mediocre. No complaints but nothing mindblowing. I can definitely find better clam chowder for a cheaper price. As for the pasta, I knew I shouldn't have gotten pasta at a fancy seafood restaurant but the variety of seafood it came with won me over. Bad decision. The pasta was nothing special and definitely not worth the price. I guess there were good chunks of seafood with the pasta but overall, the dish is hopefully not one of Waterfront's better ones. I would never get that dish again. The petrale sole everyone else had looked decent though. Maybe I should've gotten that instead.  If you sit outside, the view of the water and the bridge is really nice! I think that's the only reason why this restaurant can charge such high prices for mediocre food. But you can definitely find restaurants with nice views AND good food so pass this one up.  Overall, expensive meh food. Won't be back.",

    "review_text": "I should have known. I simply should have known. 4th of July and 1.5 hours until fireworks. We figured it should be fine. Staff was busseling around and it was a full house but not overly crowded. We even overheard the staff saying that fireworks were see-able from the patio where we were sitting.  Firstly, it took forever for the waiter to take our order. I understood that it was a holiday, so I didn't let it get me riled up. An hour from when we ordered, we get our food....and one wrong dish. We decide not to send it back because we don't want to wait. The food was okay. Mashed potatoes were bland, asparagus was undercooked, but the flat iron steak was very good. The glaze was delicious.  We foolishly ordered dessert. 20 minutes later it arrives. A piece of flavorless chocolate \"fondant\" (AKA: Cheesecake) and sticky toffee pudding (which is really cake and I had no idea). The caramel ice cream was lightly flavored but completely ruined by the giant piece of mint placed underneath.  Fireworks started before we even got our dessert. And the waiter lied in saying that fireworks were visible. It even took about 10 minutes for the waiter to even run my card.  Overall, the food was bland and sub-par. Prices are astronomical compared to what the quality of food is. Service is S-L-O-W.  I would never recommend this place to anyone. How they stay in business with so many other restaurants nearby astounds me.  UPDATE: I was contacted by the manager today through Yelp, and was sorely disappointed. He apologized, only to then lather his message with excuses as to why they were slow and that I misunderstood what was said about the fireworks.  To me, this further lowered my opinion of this establishment. It was uncouth, and was generally insulting. When I hear a waiter say \"Yes, the fireworks are visible from here.\", there is no way to misunderstand that statement. On top of that, blaming the slow service (and wrong dish) on the holiday and on staff is a poor excuse, especially for someone claiming to be the manager.   Because of this interaction, I have re-rated from a 2 star to a 1 star rating.",

After spending a day with my folks touring Alcatraz, we passed The Waterfront on the way to the ferry and decided we were hungry. \u00a0The four of us looked like refugees from a deserted island due to the wind from the island. \u00a0Although the restaurant itself looked upscale we still felt very welcomed despite our casual attire. \u00a0It was a little early for the dinner seating so went to the bar and ordered drinks from the Happy Hour menu and the bartender was extremely friendly and attentive. \u00a0Within 10 minutes the hostess retrieved us and we were seated upstairs next to the window with a beautiful view of the bay.  We very much enjoyed the 99 cent oysters to nibble before dinner. \u00a0The wait staff made certain we always had drinks and fresh, hot, delicious bread. \u00a0Between the four of us, we had the Cioppino which nailed the zesty, tomatoey broth. \u00a0The Handmade Linguini hooked two of us. \u00a0It was cooked to perfection, and not drowned in sauce, which really allowed the flawlessly executed seafood to shine. \u00a0The Halibut came with a spaetzle that my stepfather absolutely raved about throughout the meal.

    "review_text": "My friend and I went there for an early dinner on the 4th of July. It started off with a friendly hostess who told us the wait would be about 30 minutes and then invited us to sit on one of the comfortable sofas in the bar area. We wandered around wondering if we had to order or drinks at the bar or if someone would wait on us. Several servers looked at us and brushed by, ignoring my questioning looks. We finally flagged one down and he immediately got us seated and handed us a wine list (nice, but we didn't want wine). \u00a0He came back about 10 minutes later and took our order, then delivered our drinks a short while later with the check. \u00a0We sat for about 15 minutes enjoying our drinks with our credit card out to pay for the drinks but he never came back.  When our table was ready the hostess came and got us. I asked if we could transfer the tab and she said, \"No, you can wait for your waiter to pay him. I'll hold your table.\" I looked around for him for a few minutes and tried to get someone to take the check. No one would. So I asked the hostess if she could just seat us and then run the check back for us. She said sure. \u00a0  We get seated at a great table upstairs with a great view - in a nearly empty dining room (so not sure why the wait...). And our friendly waiter comes by to give us menus and water. We ask him the specials and he said he just got there so didn't know them. I'd expect that after a 20+ minute wait, our waiter would be ready to serve us.   Then our cocktail server comes rushing up to the table in a panicked voice, \"I was looking everywhere for you, I thought you left. I didn't get your tab.... where did you go?\" I explained that the hostess said she'd run it down to him and his response was, \"Oh, she's stupid. She didn't' do it. She doesn't do anything and I couldn't find you anywhere.\" \u00a0I assured him that I wasn't running out on my check and that calling a co-worker stupid wasn't nice and very unprofessional and I handed it to him with my credit card, it was still sitting on my table, where the hostess had left it. \u00a0By then our waiter was back and he apologized for the cocktail server's outburst.   So then during our meal our waiter goes on and on and on about it, oblivious to the fact that he was interrupting our conversation. \u00a0Then the GM came over and crouches down at the table to apologize for his cocktail server, saying it should have never happened, it should have been handled better, and then asks, \"Can you do me a favor?\" He hands me his business card and asks me, 'Please put this in an email and send it to me so I can document it. That will really help me deal with it.\" \u00a0He spent about 5 minutes at our table (too long, a simple apology would have been fine), admits his staff acted inappropriately and then asks me to do him a favor? Are you kidding me? We spent over $85 on 2 dinners (with no drinks) with tip and this is the level of service we get? They treat us unprofessionally and then I'm asked to do them a favor??? No offer to comp our salads or get complimentary dessert. Nothing. We just shook our heads.   I ordered a Cesar salad that was bland. It even had fresh anchovies on it and it was bland. I had to wait 5 minutes for the cracked pepper I asked for and we didn't get our (delicious) warm sourdough bread until after our salads were gone (they said it wasn't ready - again, why the 20 minute wait for the table? Obviously they weren't ready for an early holiday rush). \u00a0For $12 I expected a really great Cesar dressing and some amazing fresh Parmesan cheese. It was just ok.   I ordered a halibut dish ($29) as my main course. Halibut is supposed to flake off as you put your fork into it. It was practically raw in the middle; tough and gummy. I called the waiter over and his response, \"oh, you want it well done..?\" No, I want it cooked. When I got it back it was still not quite cooked enough in the middle, so I just left that part on the plate.   During our meal the cocktail server guy came over and apologized and stood there forever going on and on and on making excuses and talking way too much. It was painful.   So overall - for a $40 per person dinner, the food was average at best, the service was painful, and they didn't have it together, they weren't ready. For a place with crisp white linens and servers in button up shirts and ties, you expect top-notch service. This was mediocre at best. And the GM should have definitely not asked me to do HIM a favor after a bad experience.",

    "review_text": "I have been here a couple times so I think they deserve a fair review. Once was for happy hour with the girls, and another time was with a group from work. I LOVE the location of the restaurant. You can't beat the view!   Happy Hour: Moscow Mules for HH? Yes please! This was my first time trying this drink after having my eye on it for a while. The ginger beer cocktail was delicious! Not too sweet with a good kick. We also got some of their $1 oysters. The oysters were fresh and had almost a sweet water flavor. Definitely worth it!  My only complaint about the HH is the limited amount of space available at the bar. A group of 6 of us had to stand because there were no seats available. All the outside seating was fully too!  Lunch: We started with an ahi ceviche with a pineapple salsa. The ahi was a little chewy but the flavor was great. It was paired with a savory pan fried plantain that complemented the ceviche nicely.   For my meal, I got the fried soft shell crab. It came with an avocado crouton salad drizzled with a champagne vinaigrette. I love crab, but have never had a soft shell. Let me just say if I could have licked the plate clean, I would have. The crab was perfectly fried and crisp with just the right amount of seasoning. The salad was buttery and added a different crunch to the meal.   Dessert consisted of the lemon souffle. A pillowy cloud of lemony heaven with a rich custard inside. It came with lavender shortbread cookies which in my opinion, had just a little too much lavender.   Overall, I enjoyed both experiences here. I will most likely be back for HH, little too pricey for a meal.",

    "review_text": "I'm going to break this review into three categories: Food, Ambiance, Service.  Food: 2 stars Crab cakes: Actually quite good. They were very small, but the crab was very meaty, fresh, and it wasn't mucked up with any creaminess in the cake itself. The sauce served with the crab cakes complimented the crust nicely. Fries: Average and for the money I expected better. They could have been a little crispier, maybe cooked another minute Clam Chowder: It had bacon in it, which was very nice. The bacon was quality (thick chunks of smoked bacon). There was also a nice amount of pepper in the chowder, which I really enjoyed. I think what was missing was that it seemed that the bacon was thrown into the chowder as an afterthought - it didn't taste as if the soup itself were stewed with bacon so the flavor wasn't injected well throughout the soup. Also, it was a little too creamy and thick for my taste. I prefer a chowder that you can't stand a spoon up in. Lemon Risotto with Lobster: There may as well have been no lobster in there, because I didn't get any lobster flavor at all. I expected the lemon to be more flavorful - there was only a hint of lemon and there was zero lemon on the finish. My expectation was to have some seafood (lobster, perhaps?) undertone but there was nothing. The portion was enormous, however and it took passing the plate around to finish it. Special last night - seared ahi tuna with butternut squash puree - It was maybe the biggest serving of ahi tuna I have ever seen. It was too thick - the sear was so thin compared to the sheer thickness of the steak. There were two pieces served in a bowl - the bowl was far too small for this portion. that dish could have easily been served on a platter twice as big. Presentation was horrible. Ok, back to the food. I took a bite and I was surprised at the lack of flavor. It was basically sashimi with a 30 second sear on each side with no flavoring. The butternut squash puree was too thin - and there was far too much of it served - you couldn't pick it up really with your fork, you really needed a spoon to scoop it. \u00a0The sweetness was nice, but I didn't understand what it was doing with the ahi tuna - there was nothing added to the ahi by combining the puree with the tuna in one bite.  Petrole Sole - There was nothing really impressive about this dish. The fish itself was well cooked but there was a severe lack of flavoring. The sauce served with the sole was tomato-based and added absolutely nothing to the fish. Crab mashed potatoes - this was by far the tastiest thing I had all night. I would go here just to get the crab mashed potatoes... it was SO GOOD. You took a bite and there was the perfect amount of shredded crabmeat intermingled with thick mashed potato and a lovely sweet butteriness that was just fabulous. Almond Cake dessert - I enjoyed the almond cake, but I've had better (often). The cake itself was moist enough but the dish would have benefited from having some liquor-based sauce drizzled over it. Strawberries and creme fraise were served with the dish. . . the creme needed a little more sweetness, it was quite bland. The combination of the three was very light - overall for a dessert too mild. Peach Tartin with Cinnamon Ice Cream - Average. The tart itself didn't stand up to the heavily syruped (and very thinly sliced) peaches. Cinnamon Ice cream was very nice - not too sweet and could have actually been a little less sweet to contrast the very very syrupy peaches. White Peach and Lemon Sorbet - my favorite dessert. Definitely order this. The white peach sorbet had that lovely \"fuzzy\" finish, which seems so hard to replicate because I rarely have the pleasure of experiencing fuzzy sorbet. The lemon sorbet was fabulous. Very tart, made your lips smack, and complimented the white peach very well. I would definitely go out of my way just to have some. Creme Brulet - I'd say that this creme brulet was above average. I love when it's not too firm, which this pulled off. Didn't knock my socks off. Espresso - this was really very good and my date actually ordered one for himself after tasting mine. did not taste burnt at all, very nice creme, lovely finish. Complimented the almond cake very nicely.  All in all, I will probably never go back for food. But, it very well may be a nice place to stop in for dessert and espresso.  Ambiance: 5 stars on the patio, 2 stars indoors The patio is the winner here, everyone's said it. The space is small and intimate and the view is to die for. There's really no other reason to take someone here.  Service: 2 stars, was three, but they lost a point at the very end.  Service was OK. \u00a0He took quite a while to get around to ordering. He never once came by to ask how the food or how the drinks were, which was a bit odd - at the end however, he said \"you do realize service is not included, right?\" Umm... LAME.  omg, I've reached my max.",

Not only does the waiter agree the wine is not good but goes on to say all wines by the glass are bad tasting and we should order a bottle (dinner was over by this point so probably not ordering a bottle). I ordered another cocktail and told the waiter the wine was not drinkable (the wine was that bad) and he charged for both!   Furthermore, he gave us attitude about splitting four courses of appetizers &amp; entres then brought them all out at the same time. Our $150 dinner was less than an hour and the only reason it was that long is it took 15 mins to get the cocktail I ordered to replace the wine. Unfortunately, it was our anniversary and instead of feeling satisfied after a romantic dinner, I'm writing this post. There's much better places in SF for a nice dinner like A-16, Butterfly, Fringle &amp; La Folle.",

Both, apparently, are adjectives with positive connotations.  *Have you ever though to yourself, 'I am freezing, \u00a0I wish I was inside.' ?  Rhetorical of course, 'cause really, why wouldn't you!?! San Francisco is always too cold! Especially at night.  *Have you ever thought to yourself, 'I am hungry' ?  It really doesn't matter. \u00a0I have been informed that humans are required to eat. (Note: This review is intended for other humans such as myself).  If you answered 'yes' to All Three of these questions, then 'Waterfront Restaurant' might be for you. \u00a0If you answered 'no' to any of these questions, then this 'review' can be discarded and/or lambasted. \u00a0(Unless you are never cold, then you are just insane, and I revoke your permission to denounce this review).  ______________________________  Using my vast array of information provided by acquaintances. \u00a0'Waterfront Restaurant' satisfies requirements for a quality 'date night' locale.  *It has a view of the bay and bay bridge, which can be imagined to view the sunset (Buildings block the actual setting sun, but it is still 'pretty', and the sun just gets in your eyes anyways)  *It has an outdoors sections, an indoors section and an 'enclosed' outdoor section for the 'outdoor' experience without all the wind and cold temperature shenanigans. \u00a0Due to dresses leaving far too much skin exposed, the 'actual' outdoors is just uncomfortable.  *It serves food. \u00a0(Alcohol as well. One must be properly prepared if a 'date' is proceeding in a less than satisfactory manner.)   _______________________________  The food is sufficient for sustenance. \u00a0It mostly consists of seafood. \u00a0Nothing revolutionary, nonetheless, nothing revolting.  I believe the unassuming food is advantageous, as I have been informed that one must 'pay attention' to your companion on a date. \u00a0Food leaning too strongly in either direction, both too good or too bad, only serves as a distraction.  The seemingly high prices for the portion is perfect for showcasing one's supposed financial stability.  The service is quite adept and friendly, ensuring that you can continue to focus upon your companion instead of service misfortunes.  ________________________________  I apologize if I have come to an incorrect conclusion due to misinformation.  However, based upon the assumption that what I have been told is indeed the truth, then:  'Waterfront Restaurant' is a great place to visit for a sunset date.",

Escolar is a type of mackerel that cannot metabolize wax esters, which are similar to castor oil. Anyone know what happens when you ingest castor oil? Consumption of escolar causes explosive, oily, orange diarrhea. People who are affected by this often have accidents because it comes on so suddenly and explosively. The Japanese and Italian governments have banned the importation and sale of escolar for these reasons. Luckily for my boyfriend, we were back at our hotel by the time he was hit - but poor guy was up all night :(.   Otherwise, the rest of our party had fairly tasty meals - I just think its a poor decision on the part of a restaurant to offer such a dangerous fish and OVER the recommended 6 ounce portion. My boyfriend's piece was easily 8-9 ounces, if not more.   I would like to give them a second chance, again the rest of our meal was quite nice, but watching my boyfriend suffer through the night and having paid so much for it, just not worth it.

My soon-to-be-wife and I rented out the North Room for our post-ceremony dinner last week, finalized everything with their planner, Cheryl, TWICE - since the reviews here said she wasn't the best planner - and then held our breath.   Upon our arrival last Friday night, to say we were pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The night was amazing! Mustafa took great care of us, poured the booze I wanted, didn't fire the entrees until I told him to, and the food...I gotta say, I wasn't expecting much from this touristy joint...but, it was great! And just to qualify that statement...I've eaten at Boulevard, Aqua, Town Hall, A-16, Greens, etc. So to all you folks who said the portions are small. You must eat in Fresno most of the time, 'cause my short ribs were HUGE! And this herre gurrl can eat!   Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks to Waterfront for making our night so great. If you come here, don't expect a French Laundry like experience, but if you're simply looking for good food and a great view, you won't be disappointed.",

    "review_text": "My first gripe about the place has to be its misrepresentation. At the bottom of the menu, it informed me that there was a \"Vegetarian Menu Available On Request\". As a vegetarian dining here with my fish-loving mother, I figured I'd have some options and asked the hostess about the veggie menu. With a complete look of vacancy in her eyes, she told me that the options were already on the menu... the appetizer portion of gnocchi. Oh, and salads. Great list of options, guys!  But my mom desperately wanted her fish, and I like to give her what she wants seeing as how she, you know, raised me and all, so I decided the gnocchi with a salad would be fine.   We were led to an AMAZING view.   The food was not so amazing, though. The gnocchi was decent, but a little bit heavy. The salad had this really, really awful dressing. It just tasted strange... I don't even know. But dessert (I had a creme brulee) redeemed the dining experience.   Oh, and the waiter was like, terribly obviously nervous. And kept saying \"understandable\" for everything. Dessert menu? \"Understandable.\" I don't know what the hell a fondant is? \"Understandable.\" Where's our check? \"Understandable.\" LEARN A NEW WORD.  I wouldn't dine here again on my own, due to the lack of vegetarian options and not-great food (except the sensational dessert). But I might come back to accommodate certain family members...",

I wish parking was free in the area but paying for a little convenience isn't that much of a hassle. right on the Waterfront just as advertised with a great view of the Bay Bridge lit up with lights.   we came to celebrate my Birthday- I'm fortunate that it falls during Dine About Town- so many places to try so little time... it's my favorite time of the year!  we ordered from the Dine About Town Menu with some extras to complement the meal. we started with some wine, a glass for me and one for her. something white to go with the seafood for the night. i love gewurztraminer :)  first up- (not on D.A.T) half a dozen of mixed oysters on a half shell. i'm still developing a pallet for them and when they are laid all in a row you can really tell the difference in the spectrum. \u00a0a little sweet, nice and fatty, hearty and salty... great start!  second (D.A.T) she had the \"house smoked salmon carpaccio\" and i had the \"lobster bisque\" with a puff pasty. although she isn't a fan of salmon she ate every bit of it in amazement! salmon carpaccio won her over. the lobster bisque was hearty, reduced to a thick consistency but bordered on salty... after such a nice start the dinner plateaued.  entree (D.A.T) she had the \"Moules Provencales- White Wine, Garlic, Cherry Tomatoes, Herbs, Fries\" and i had the \"Seared Ahi Tuna- Wild Mushroom Escabeche, Arrowhead Spinach\" i asked to switched. i know a bit of a diva and i was pulling it's my birthday card but she was kind enough to do so. the seared ahi tuna and the spinach and mushrooms they put together didn't go together. the taste left my pallet twisted and in dismay. the mussels were okay. not a saving grace. just okay. a bit bland. the entree left both of us wanting... and now it was starting to dip...  dessert (D.A.T) we both had the \"Chocolate Fondant- Raspberry Coulis\" usually on special occasions they would add a candle to celebrate the event. i know i shouldn't expect but i did. i suppose it's my fault that i was disappointed. the fondant was tasty, rich, and i wish there was more of the raspberry drizzled on the saucer... it wasn't enough to save the dinner though.  until next time  cheers!",

The drinks are always good, but the last two times I went my food hasn't been good at all, as has the food of my companions. Steaks WAY too rare (I like my steaks practically raw but wow, when you say medium-rare they just warm it up a little), overcooked seafood, and cold pasta.  I was seated on the second floor the last time I went, and the server forgot about our table multiple times, as he forgot about the two couples seated behind us. We were at dinner for close to four hours, and at one point I had to walk down and find a server to get more water. While I like a leisurely dining experience, this wasn't the graceful and attentive service one expects from a restaurant like this-- it was neglectfulness.  While I hate to say it, I won't be coming back-- the Waterbar has the same view, $1 oysters during happy hour, and faster and friendlier service.",

    "review_text": "My wife and I first ate at the Waterfront last October. We were in SF on Fleet Week. We were strolling along the Embarcadero and it was around lunch time. It looked inviting, and we decided to try it. Loved it!   So when it turned out that we were going to be back in The City in mid-April, we decided to try Waterfront again. This time for dinner.   We arrived on time for our reservation. Were greeted very cordially when we checked in and escorted to our table. It wasn't very busy, but for some reason, our server seemed very hassled. My wife had questions about some of the specialty drinks on the menu. He seemed very frustrated about getting her info about the drinks.   \"We've got a new, celebrity bartender. He's added a lot of new things to the menu. I don't really know what's in it . Yadda, yadda, yadda.\"   OK, we ended up ordering things that we knew. Fine.   Then we got to the food. Yum! We picked the restaurant for 3 reasons - the view, seafood, and our favorable lunch experience. The view was fab-fab-fab. The menu choices met our expectations for fresh fish and seafood. My wife ordered the prix fixe 'anniversary special.' It was Maine lobster served with a starter choice of soup or salad and a choice of dessert. So, do you need to go to San Francisco for Maine lobster? Maybe not. But she was very pleased by the meal.   I started with a classic Caesar salad. It was good, but not remarkable. Then I had roasted fresh wild fish; my choice was escolar served with a saffron buerre blanc sauce. Fabulous.   By the end of the evening, our server warmed up to us. He struck up a casual conversation. Asked where we were from. Engaged in casual chit-chat. Linda thought he was just fishing for a tip. Maybe.   So my conclusion is this: Food = good. Service = mediocre. View = Great. Value = ok.   As I think about the restaurants that we've eaten at in SF, I don't think we'd make a point of returning to Waterfront. But if we're wandering down the Embarcadero and it's lunch time, we might stop in for a bite.",

I wanted to impress them. \u00a0After being greeted warmly by the hostess, we requested to be seated upstairs. The hostess went to talk to the server and came back telling us it was not possible. I insisted telling her about my visitors. \u00a0She went back to the stairs where the server was waiting and after a few minutes of animated discussion, she came back with the OK of the server, I guess. We sat by the window. The servers came to greet us with a grim look on his face. He looked very unhappy. We ordered some wine. \u00a0I was told that the wine I ordered was not available. The server seems to be very frustrated. No big deal, I ordered something else. Food was ordered and when the oysters were served, I ask their origin, the waiter seems confused, and then said something, inaudible and left. Main course came along a while later and when they served my father, half of his French fries went on his lap. My steak was over cooked and my sister's scallops were barely cooked. I started to wander if I made a mistake by coming to the restaurant. Then, a gentleman, nicely dressed, came along and ask us with a French accent if everything was fine. \u00a0Of-course, I explained the situation. In a NY minute, he brought me a steak perfectly cooked, as well as my sister's scallops done faultlessly. Everyone was impressed and very happy. The meal was saved from an average experience, because the management was able to correct the mistakes made and even didn't charge for my glass of wine.",

The manager came over and informed us that he deleted our reservation because we were 15 minutes late. He did it in an extremely rude manner. We inquired about our original table, and he informed us that he would not give it to us because we were late. He then rudely stated \"GO SIT OVER ON THE COUCH AND WAIT.

Given their location by the water, it should be a slam dunk really but sadly it misses the mark with little things that slowly add up.   Had dinner with a party of 12 here and were seated in a cozy section upstairs after having a glass of wine in the sofa area. The views (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DeGdhZKXoTnyyFc8GC2BHg?select=7lWQFIIf10KDnIMewJFSqg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DeGd\u2026</a>) here are quite spectacular ... even on foggy SF days. We split a couple of apps for our long table. Didn't really care for the fried calamari but thoroughly enjoyed the pancetta wrapped shrimp, lobster-truffle mac &amp; cheese, and the crab cakes. A good start to dinner but that's when stuff started to unravel.   I ordered the ahi tuna with soy wasabi (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DeGdhZKXoTnyyFc8GC2BHg?select=IgRlnDVZAvbkvEBP07BgDw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DeGd\u2026</a>) and a side of roasted root vegetables. Service had been pretty friendly and attentive till this point but they got flustered with our large group. As food started coming out, there was quite a bit of confusion with sides and I realized that they had an extra side of the root vegetables at the other end of the table so they just gave it to them. When I was served with my entree, they didn't bring out my side. When I asked our server about it, he insisted I didn't order any. \"No I totally did. You wrote it down and served it to the other end of the table instead.\" I did eventually get my side dish when I corrected him. Food was decent. Also had the chocolate fondant (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DeGdhZKXoTnyyFc8GC2BHg?select=BX7psvi1lg3K1pmbNaLJoQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/DeGd\u2026</a>) but I don't think dessert is the Waterfront's forte. \u00a0   It might seem like an isolated incident but I experienced similar misses on a previous visit during lunch. We sat outside on a nice sunny day. Service was scattered but I enjoyed my fish and chips. My friend order the Louis salad with dungeness crab but it came with wilted greens. You really shouldn't get wilted salad greens on a $20 salad.   All in all, it might be worth taking a chance on the Waterfront for the view. While the food isn't bad, though not fantastic either, don't be too surprised if you leave feeling like it was a sub-par experience.",

Couple weeks ago, i went there with a friend for lunch. The lady who served us, I think her name is 'Brenda..' sth, tried to remember her name tag, I could be wrong. She was rude. Both me and my friend were very offended by the way she talked and acted. Annoyed as she was not just paying little attention, but she was basically giving an attitude like - 'do you know what you are ordering' type of arrogance by saying 'You want that?!' with a smirk. Oh... gosh, I felt very wrong, my friend felt the same way, so I guess it's fair to feel like crap in front of a such great view!

The bridge lit up at night, the sound of the Bay lapping in the distance, and the constant breeze blowing the sea scents through the air.   All of this ocean indulgence made me really hungry for some of the ocean's finest, natch, so I conned my colleagues into squirreling away their entire daily meal allowance for a seafood feast at Waterfront. I'm a bully like that. But it is always for everyone's best interest. Most of the time. Definitely some of the time. Okay I'm a bully for purely selfish reasons. But this tryst through The Embarcadero was honestly in everyone's best interest, not just mine.   But I digress. I wanted lobsta and shrimp and scallops and every other creature of the sea I could get my mitts on. And I found it all at Waterfront. Succulent crustacean heaven, I tell you. Served with grilled lemon halves and sides of your choosing, Waterfront quenched my seafood cravings with aplomb. Our server was a peach, and did a really nice job of recommending the driest white wine in the house. She seemed a little miffed when our party of 10 had to use 10 credit cards to pay (corporate life, what are ya gonna do?) but she was still a doll and split up the check a zillion times for us.   My only qualm with Waterfront was the layout. It's just awkward. If they cleared out all the tables and chairs, it'd be a great multi-layered stage for a pop singer to sprinkle her backup dancers on. I didn't see the point of having raised platforms every so often for some tables. But hey, it was nice looking down on the peasants while munching on Sebastian &amp; Friends.",

We came here on a mild evening for their Happy Hour menu, and got a chance to eat in their \"patio\" area. \u00a0Wanting to try a bit of everything, we ordered their Clams with White Wine and Garlic, Mussels in Madras Curry, Calamari, Fries, and the Duet of Sliders. \u00a0The Calamari and the Fries were pretty standard, though they went great with the aioli sauce (calamari) or the mussels/clams sauces (fries). \u00a0The Clams and Mussels were pretty good, but I would opt for the mussels again if only because the Madras Curry made it a little more unique. \u00a0The real winner was the sliders plate - really hit the spot with a cold beer after a day at work, and probably one of the better sliders I've had. \u00a0  There are certainly some redeeming qualities about this place, but I have to admit I can see why some felt their experience was underwhelming. \u00a0Service was uneven, as the waitress was nice, but it took a while for her to make her rounds. \u00a0Also, when we arrived to get a table for the happy hour, the hostess gave us an odd look and checked the clock before bringing us a table (we were there 30 mins before it ended, so not sure what was going on there). \u00a0Some of the prices seem to land a bit on the high side based on the menu, but hard to say if it's worth it quality/portion wise. \u00a0Decent chance I'll be back at some point though, especially to try their Lobster Risotto and Crab Mashed Potatoes.",

I've been to Waterfront back its Clinton heyday. It was at least four stars back then--and if you asked good ol' BC--our former, hyper-gonadal commander in chief--I guess he'd have said it was five stars, given that this was his seafood place of choice in SF. But that was then and this is now. Waterfront is still alive but not doing particularly well these days.  I made reservations a week ahead for Mr. G's birthday and given they were not packed to the gills I expected a decent table. But no, we got crammed into the restaurant's main thoroughfare. \u00a0There we experienced waiters and patrons shuffling past leaving air eddies in their wakes, the cold outside blowing in making me grab my sweater, and Mr. G informed me that I accidentally almost tripped a waiter as I pulled out to use the restroom. True, I didn't use my blinker but these guys come streaming by like they're serving meals to marathoners on the run.   In addition to being chilly it was loud. And the10$ valet parking fee seemed sort of a gouge but it goes with the territory in SF these days. And the much tauted view? What view? We couldn't see it from our miniature table for two shoved behind a wall.  The food was decent/fine/ordinary/OK/edible/not bad/lackluster, or in Yelp vernacular: Meh.   I wonder what BC's SF favorite seafood place is these days. No doubt, it's no longer the Waterfront. \u00a0::Yawn::",

Fresh Oysters: Under their Dine About Town menu, one of the options was three fresh oysters. I absolutely loved this dish and how fresh the oysters were! Yummmmm!  Grilled Rainbow Trout: This was my favorite dish. The rainbow trout was grilled perfectly with great flavors. Portion-wise, I thought they were pretty generous. Sadly, I don't believe this is on their regular menu but I wish it was!  Oven Roasted Pork Loin: My boyfriend ordered this dish and enjoyed it as well. The pork was a little on the dry side but the sauce helped. We also enjoyed that the portions for this dish were very generous and was more than enough to fill him up!  Creme Brulee: This was a great dessert to end our meal. Their creme brulee had plenty of flavor from the vanilla beans at the bottom. I wish the shell on top was a little crunchier but it was still pretty good. The tart flavors of the fruits complemented the sweetness of the dessert pretty well. This was definitely enough to share!  Parking in this area can be a little difficult but they do offer a valet service. The staff was very friendly and helpful!

The first visit was more enjoyable than the second visit. However, we had a great time both times we were here. Loved: The seafood cobb salad.. YUM!

I ordered the Waterfront cioppino and it was worth $34! Delicious! I look forward to dessert so I wanted to make sure I saved room for that! Got the mini dessert sampler $18, it was perfect because you get to try a little bit of everything. This place is great for special occasions. You get to over look the bridge at sunset, gourmet meal and high class service.  My only downer, my fathers lobster wasn't fully cooked. Though it was full of meat it was under cooked. I would have liked for him to enjoy his meal especially bc he paid a lot for it! But other than that definitely is a just go place :)",

    "review_text": "HORRIBLE service. Mediocre food. I had high expectations for this place... I like dining in the city, and the thought of beng on the embarcadero looking out at the bay at night with decent food... but the experience was marred by poor service and lackluster, almost offensive, food presentation.  Had a 8pm reservation for a party of four - two couples. My wife and I arrive a few minutes to 8. The hostess welcomes us but points out, oddly, \"your reservation is in 13 minutes.\" I took it to mean, 'go sit down, you are early and we can't seat you now.' Ok when someone gives me precision like that - sort of with an attitude, then I hold them to it. So at 8pm, I look over and ask if the table is ready. This is when the cluster#$% starts. There is another hostess who does the seating, walking to the table with menus bit. The gal at the front door who looks at the reservation computer has no say in the matter. So together they do this lame ass thing where she looks at the computer to see who is to be seated next, the other gal looks around and sees if the table is ready, they debate which party is next and why, then she runs around to get that party seated... it's total goofball behavior. Anyways, it's now 8:30 and we're not seated. They make some excuse like, \"oh we are just waiting for the rest of your party.\" Well I told them, no, we want to be seated and they will join us.  Anyway, during all this, about 3 waiters come up to the front to bitch to the hostesses about something... I presume it's about what tables are being seated in their stations. Totally poor display in front of customers for the wait staff to be bitching and flailing arms...jeez a-holes take it up at a staff meeting.  Somewhere near 8:45, after two more requests, she seats us. She tells us, \"oh I have a special table for you near a window.\" She takes us up to the 3rd floor... weird, as I expected the 2nd floor. The 3rd floor 'looks' nice, but you quickly realize it is some overflow after-thought area. Not only aren't we seated next to a window (she puts us in the middle of the room) - which is fine, there is a 360 glass window all around so the view is decent... but the ambiance in the room SUCKS. Weird flourescent canned lights create bright glare, and the AC is on and its cold.  Worst of all, I know the 3rd floor must have been some overflow spot because there is inconsistent wait staff service. We were served by 4 different waiters, and waitied 15 minutes to even be asked if we were ready to order. Asked the first guy for some bread... nada. Asked the second guy.... nada. FInally asked the hostess as she seated another couple, \"Can we have some bread?\" to which she replied \"Yes you can.\"... more attitude biatccccch!?! \u00a0Finally yet another guy comes by with some delicious cold and stale sourdough. mmmmmmm, good.  When the dinner finally arrived, its was all pretty disappointing. \u00a0Small portions, and I'm not a big eater by any means. Ordered the homemade linguini with various sea food.... lobster, crab, mussels, etc. \u00a0I kid you not, I think I got 5 small little diced up pieces of lobster? WTF, isn't this SF in the heart of shellfish season? I expected some big juicy lobster pieces, not some shit that looks like it came out of a frozen bag. \u00a0My wife asked for crab with her vegetable linguini. Couldn't see any crab, asked the waiter...who said he'd ask the cook. Waiter comes back and says 'cook says yes there is crab.' Well guess what, there wasn't any g.d. crab in there.  Bottom line, I wouldn't eat here again. Clearly the place is poorly run and draws in people due to its location.  Oh PS - forgot to mention, wife said there was no TP \u00a0or papertowels in the ladies room.",

Food quality is decent and service is pretty consistent, and yes, it does tend to attract tourists, but then what restaurant with a view this good doesn't?  I'd normally rate this kind of eatery a 3-stars, but I'm giving Waterfront Restaurant +1 star because once upon a time, a staff member there showed extraordinary kindness to a friend of mine who hurt his ankle skateboarding at Pier 7.  I didn't get his name, but he was a bartender or another member of the floor staff, and I came in underdressed, in my t-shirt and shorts, carrying only my skateboard. \u00a0He didn't hesitate to fill a plastic bag with ice and head out to check on my friend.  It turns out that this kind soul had some medical or physical rehab training in high-ankle sprains, and he showed a lot of compassion and humanity towards my injured friend.  For this memorable act, I will always think well of the Waterfront. \u00a0Not everyone hates skateboarders. \u00a0In fact, one alumnus of this restaurant showed compassion and sympathy and was exactly the right person to help a skateboarder who severely rolled his ankle.  And yes, the views are great! \u00a0 My mom would often visit me by taking the Vallejo Ferry to the SF Ferry Building when it was mostly architects' offices (way before it became a yuppie-scum shopping hub).  She didn't want to walk all the way to Cafe Claude or any of my favorite places downtown, so we would take a short stroll along the Embarcadero to the Waterfront and have lunch. \u00a0We had no complaints whatsoever and the service was always good. \u00a0I haven't been back in a while, but when I do, I'll give y'all an update.  As for now, a belated \"Merci beaucoup\" to the guy who worked at the Waterfront Restaurant during the Pier 7 skateboarding days who gave a \u00a0his time and expertise to help a fellow human being.",

The seafood was fresh and there was 3 different sauces.

They did not skimp on the crab meat. I enjoyed some wine that we brought and also their cocktail called Lemon Meringue was so good. \u00a0For dessert, I had the rhubarb crisp a la mode which was good.

My experience here was not pleasant. \u00a0 But I'll start with the good  The whiskey sour was made well, I ordered two and it's just how I make them at home (bartender for two years) Bread was wonderful, tasted fresh, and warm. \u00a0 And the view absolutely fabulous. What a location, and a very nice looking dining room.  Having worked in food service before here is what I found difficult to swallow about waterfront restaurant.  First the service Half of our party arrived at ~715 was greeted promptly and placed at our table and we're able to order drinks, good drinks. \u00a0The other half arrived a 10 minutes later and they too were greeted well and were able to order their drinks promptly. So now with drinks in hand we're talking about the menu we're ready to order and it's impossible to get our waiter. I happen to be in a great seat to observe the whole restaurant, I notice our waiter passing by a few different times but always in such a rush that he doesn't look around to us trying to get his attention. It almost takes a half hour before able to order. We had finished our drinks before were you able to order. We were not given bread until after we had ordered. \u00a0Now if the restaurant was packed this would be completely understandable however the restaurant was half packed and half empty and you should have to wait half hour to order. \u00a0  The food  I'm going to give the positive and negative about the food. You're a party of 6 three of us ordered for appetizers the clam chowder two of us ordered Caesar salad I found the clam chowder to be excessive with cream and to be lacking in clams. One of the other souo eaters agreed with me while the other thought the soup was fantastic. Both Caesar salad people thought the Caesar was fair and that the lettuce tasted old. \u00a0 For the main course we had the crab beat salad, a bowl of risotto, escolar, the handmade linguini, and the fresh fish of the day. Those who had the salad found it nice and the one who had the linguini loved it both fish eaters however we're not enamored with the taste of the fish and as the risotto eater I've never had a worse risotto. If the restaurant didn't have such a pledge towards local and fresh food I would have sworn the risotto lobster was frozen, and so overloaded with lemon juice in order to mask the lobsters shortcomings. At the end of the meal we sat waving around a credit card trying to get our waiters attention so we could leave All in all the food was fine, it was ok, not great. But at the price point, with such inattentive service \u00a0it was awful",

First, here's what right with the place: The decor is nice, the location on the bay is great, the views of the Bay Bridge are wonderful and service was very good.  Unfortunately, all of that doesn't make up for truly mediocre food. \u00a0The salad was good and the flatiron steak was good (and when the best you thing you can say about \u00a0seafood restaurant is that the steak is good, there's a problem!) \u00a0My wife's swordfish was only okay, and two of us in our party felt our salmon was horrible. \u00a0We left most of it uneaten--it seemed terribly overcooked and was absolutely tasteless.  We complained to our server who brought over a manager. \u00a0He was very apologetic and offered us free cappuccinos (which none of us wanted), but did not offer to discount any of the meal (which might have been appropriate considering we ate only a third of our two salmon meals.)  There are many great seafood restaurants in San Francisco. \u00a0I see no reason to return to the Waterfront given our experience.",

We were hoping to be able to sit outside by the water, but they directed us to the couches right in front of the entrance, noting that this space or the bar area were both okay for happy hour.   We ordered an assortment of food to share. I didn't get to try them all, but one thing that was pretty standard was the tiny size of the dish! Everything came in small square dishes that reminded me more of what you would get as a side dish rather than an appetizer. However, some of the food was pretty good! Truffle Parmesan Fries - Soo good! But then again, when are truffle fries not? I also like that the fries are thickly cut, as they're not super crispy. Calamari &amp; Shrimp - I didn't really like this one. The calamari is just okay, I didn't feel like the squid meat was that great, and a portion of the dish is like deep-fried veggies? I definitely got a few pieces of onions. Oysters - Yum! I can never say no to $1 oysters. They tasted really fresh, and I liked the two sauces that came with them.   Two of my roommates also ordered drinks, which to be brief were really good! We tried a Lemon Drop and a Cosmo, and though this could be a good or bad thing, neither tasted heavily of alcohol.  Don't think I'd be back for happy hour food, but the restaurant is nice and our server was great (albeit a little slow)!",

AMBIANCE - Nice covered outdoor seating in front of the ocean with the view of the SF bridge I was a bit worried since I was there for dinner and the seatings were outside but all the outdoor seating were covered and there were heating lamps. \u00a0I was able to enjoy my food without shivering in ocean breeze.

It's got a view of the bridge! \u00a0So do a lot of other places with better food or you could simply walk along the waterfront itself which makes for a more romantic evening IMO. So how did I end up here? \u00a0Simple. The Sunset Boat Party was docked next door and, while waiting for my chocolate 'shrooms to kick in, I decided to partake in Ryan W.'s pizza before boarding the Drug Boat. \u00a0Said pizza (the seafood/salami kind) was so oily that it was akin to the Exxon Valdez spill. \u00a0Seriously, I think I saw relief crews start lining up ready to take care of local wildlife inadvertently harmed in the consumption of the pizza. \u00a0There was also the curious choice of combining shrimp and salami. \u00a0Definitely not kosher, which means dick to me because I'm not Jewish and if I was I wouldn't restrict myself because I believe that if there is a god then that entity wouldn't give a damn what food I was shoving down my pie-hole so long as I made the appropriate gestures of respect while doing so. \u00a0In any case, the shrimp and salami did NOT have what I would consider a harmonious marriage of taste. \u00a0I think that their marriage is one that counseling couldn't save and they need to just go their separate ways. \u00a0I also found the service to be lacking and Ryan W. had to get napkins and plates himself before we were able to eat. \u00a0It also took him an unreasonable amount of time to close out his tab and I watched the bartender serve several other people AFTER Ryan W. had requested his check. \u00a0 In short, I probably would have given this place a higher rating had my drugs kicked in because you would HAVE TO be trippin' to think this place is good.",

The last time was absolutely horrid. I arrived just after 6 pm with my husband and we were seated immediately in the patio overlooking the bay. The view is gorgeous, especially at night. Within seconds of seating, our server (a middle aged woman) came over to take our whole order, not just the drink order, but everything. I didn't quite know what I wanted, so she said she'd come back. Maybe 2 minutes later she asked what we'd like to drink. While she adequately made a recommendation for wine pairing to go with our entree (we shared the hand-made pasta with seafood), she offered no other help other than saying things like \"that's a good choice\" after we placed our order.   We chose to share the crab cakes as our starter, share a caesar salad and, as already mentioned, the hand-made pasta. Our drinks came out and within 7 minutes of being seated our starter and our salad came out at the SAME TIME. What's more is that the salad wasn't split at all. It came out on a big plate, unchopped, and made for an awkward experience as we had to reach across our starter plates to cut it up and share amongst ourselves. The crab cakes were great, being almost completely comprised of crab and lightly crunchy on the outside.   We finished our salad and starter and sat there awhile with empty plates on the table until they were eventually cleared and I should say that it was not busy at all. They then set up new plates for us to share the entree. Our server placed a VERY dirty plate in front of my husband as his entree plate and quickly walked away. We kindly asked one of the bussers to replace it and he was very apologetic and did so right then. Shortly after, our entree came out and we'd only been seated for just under 20 minutes! While the pasta was good, it wasn't anything spectacular. I enjoyed the ciopinno more the last visit. I couldn't believe how our server was rushing us. I have over 6 years of serving experience and would never in my wildest dreams ever do that to a table. I understand that you have to turn tables quickly to make money, but this was just ridiculous!  She was so quick with everything and seemed annoyed that we wouldn't move along faster, asking if we were all set as we were still eating. I never tip less than 15% for service, often times tipping upwards to 30% for a truly wonderful meal, but my husband was so appalled with our service that he could hardly bring himself to tip 10%.  I would not recommed this place to anyone until this restaurant holds some sort of meeting to re-examine the purpose of serving. I can justify paying over $30 an entree if the service is wonderful... but this was not the case. The server should be terminated.",

Food was not terrible, but the service was sufficiently slow enough that our table was still being laid when we were shown to it, therefore it missed some cutlery and the condiments. The staff were so busy that when we were served our main course, it was only warm and not hot. \u00a0When we told them, they microwaved it. \u00a0  The impression was that they try and give a good impression, which is great when you walk in the door, but they have extended too much which means that they struggle to cope, which is a real shame, as they could be so much better if they were to close one of the two marquees they have and concentrate on their guests more.",

The servers were all excellent -- always coming by to see if we needed more bread or water as we waited for our food, and always checked to see if we were satisfied.  First off, we were pretty sad that they had run out of oysters by the time we arrived at 8:30pm. That was a bummer...so, I just went on to order off the Dine About Town menu.  I had the Lobster Bisque -- a lobster-flavoured soup with a puff pastry. It was a nice balance of different flavours with not too much lobster taste! I ordered the Moules Provencales (a bunch of mussels) and it came with French fries -- the mussels were plentiful and the sauce was delicious (apparently goes well with fries!). You also get an unopened, cute, miniature-sized Heinz ketchup jar! For dessert, I had the Chocolate Fondant with Raspberry Coulis! It was like eating a slice of chocolate mousse pie, yum!

The place was dead on a beautiful wednesday during lunch and I can now sorta see why.  Crab Cakes- really good but they were smaller than golf balls ( 17 bucks right there) it was like one bite- felt ripped and def not enough to split with someone. Her Shrimp Salad: She said \"It's fine\" Lobster Salad Sandwich: Decent and the amount of lobster is what I would expect from a restaurant. Not generous but also wasn't non-existent. They put bacon and avacodo on the sandwish which completely overpowers anything else- but I'm easy to please with sandwiches. Came with a skimpy side salad and not fries( didn't realize this until it was delivered, but def a buzz kill)  Service was good, location is great and they give you some good bread to begin with.

Upon arrival the SHORT hostess never greeted us.   She flatly said, \"NAME?\" After much trouble trying to find us in her little book, taller blond hostess stared at us with this dumb f***ing look on her face.   We proceeded to follow shorty to the dining room.   She passed a table seated in front of the water. \u00a0The table was square and was prepared for seating but FOR SOME REASON she wanted to seat us just opposite from there. \u00a0I reminded her that I requested waterfront seating. \u00a0  She said that is for a \"Larger Party\". \u00a0 I thought, \"It has the same amount of chairs, place settings, and the table is the exact same size as the one opposite (not by the water)\".  I did not understand her logic. \u00a0I had reservations. \u00a0I was on time. \u00a0That table was empty.  Half way into my dinner experience she had only seated 3 people at that table. \u00a0  Because I had been to your restaurant many times prior, I knew the food would better the situation. \u00a0I WAS WRONG! \u00a0We ordered the Free Range Turkey which was served luge warm, I did not taste sausage in the stuffing, the root vegetables were near raw. \u00a0I ordered a side of the lobster macaroni; the lobster pieces were firm cubes. \u00a0I don't believe Lobster is suppose to be firm. \u00a0  My bill came to $107. \u00a0And after tip it came to $135. \u00a0I did not return food or complain about the Hostess, as I did not want to upset my son for this Special Occasion.

Next came the lobster which was great. \u00a0Large and succulant. It was perfect. \u00a0I didn't really even need to use the butter since it was so creamy and buttery already. \u00a0I even used some of my left over bread to pick up the juices left from it to get every single last morsel left. Yum...  Then ending with the chocolate fondant was amazing. \u00a0My bf put it best when he said it tasted like eating a See's candy with a fork. \u00a0So rich and chocolatey but not overpowerling sweet...more on a rich thick flavor. \u00a0Very much a piece of heaven for a chocolate lover, which I'm not reallly but I did enjoy it.  Overall the experience and meal was great. \u00a0I didn't like the soup but everything else was great. \u00a0Huge wine list, and seafood done well. \u00a0I took a bite of my bf's cioppino and it was also amazing. \u00a0I came in with low expectations since majority of yelpers gave bad reviews but I can personally say they surpassed my expectations. \u00a0It is a bit pricey for some dishes but if you did the 3 course pre-fixe meal like most of us did we were satisfied...especially the lobster anniversary deal their having at the moment!

Good food and good service.   We walked in and they seated us on the patio as we requested. The view was incredible and the evening was a fabulous way to start the first day in San Francisco after several years of not being here.. It was sunny and hot till about 8:30   As the evening breeze came up we asked the bus boy if he could move the heater lamp by us cause it was getting cold. He did so, no questions asked and when he couldn't get it to lite, he got additional help.   Our waitress came over and took our drink order immediately. I wasn't sure how I was going to like the waitress cause she came off a little abrupt at first, (I think there was a culture barrier I might have had) but when we got to talking, she was actually really accommodating and we were glad we stayed.   We ordered:   1) Buttermilk Fried Calamari, Rock Shrimp, Fennel &amp; Spicy Aioli  This is one of my favorites here. It is soo incredibly good and fresh. We ordered a second round. We always order this when we come here.   2) Grilled Pancetta Wrapped Prawns, White Bean Truffle Ragout  I couldn't stop eating these. Like with the Calamari, we ordered 2 or 3 of these.   3) Dungeness Crab Cakes, Mache, Meyer Lemon Aioli  This was delicious and full of fresh crab. Didn't have all that filler that a lot of restaurants use to save on the expense of crab meat.",

    "review_text": "\"Meh\" pretty much sums it up. The restaurant is pretty, the view is great. If you get stuck going here, its not the end of the world. Whoever designed the menu did a reasonably good job, but the execution is poor both on the food quality and the service front. And you know what poor execution means in a seafood restaurant: yup, that's overcooked fish. Nothing here tastes _bad_, mind you, but its often not high on the flavor or freshness scale. As other reviewers observed, the crab mashed potatoes are worth eating, esp. with a tasty lemon sauce around them. Your other choices are tuna (got good reviews at my table), slightly overcooked salmon, slightly overcooked white fish of various varieties. And steak. Dessert, ditto: flourless chocolate cake, ok, apple tart , shrug, etc etc. If I were served this food at a large wedding or other event, it would be unremarkably fine. Something you can eat without comment in the background. At an SF restaurant, it seems inexcusable. Especially given the prices.  As for the service, it was well-intentioned. But it didn't work out successfully. We were a table of 10, and the waitress wrote down the position of every dish. But then the plates would come and it would be a whole 5 min of, who ordered the salmon? Repeated with every course. And the wrong desserts came out, there was a 5 min discussion withe the waitress of whether it was possible to order a half-caf cappuccino (I was spectating and the result seemed highly unclear, though some form of cappuccino did arrive). And each plate seemed to be brought by a different person who had no contextual information, despite the fact that the restaurant was largely empty.  To sum up: the 2.5 star average on Yelp seems fair to me. Don't go by choice, but if you have to go, you'll live through the experience. My recommendation: order a couple straight whiskeys and eat the crab mashed potatoes.",

So last night I, my girlfriend and two other friends decided hey why not, lets go check it out. Luckily for us the place wasn't packed, I've heard it usually is and on the regular there is a 45 minute wait. \u00a0But hey maybe we are special so we had zero waiting time. No the reality is it was a Tuesday evening. What can I say?  After taking a glance at the menu and seeing the pretty expensive salads, I'm not even going to touch on how much the main courses were, we decided to keep it light. So I ordered the saut\u00e9ed spinach along with their cabbage and mash potatoes. Honestly I was not that impressed and these sides were greatly over priced. Now my friends were not as conservative as I was, one friend ordered the \"Whole Fish Dish\" and that was exactly what was served. It actually creeped me out a little to have the fish staring at me while my friend was devouring its insides.  The others had the macaroni and cheese with lobster. Now they appeared to be content with their meals, I didn't hear a word out of them while they ate. Just munching and chewing.  The bill came after a timely wait on our server getting it to us. I was not going to pay for the overpriced sea rodent that stared at me during the entire dinner, nor for the two who ordered the mac and cheese with lobster simply because they enjoyed themselves to much. Lol \u00a0However, I had to bite the bullet and pay the cost for my fancy side orders! In conclusion service can use some improvement and in our current economy pricing could be looked at too.",

I had mussels. \u00a0They were pretty darn good. \u00a0The linguine with clams was just right and the shrimp with some sort of meat wrapped around it appetizer was just ok. \u00a0But that's not what this review's about. \u00a0  We ordered the soup of the day: a salsify and dungeness crab soup that I am still thinking about. \u00a0I dunno if I ever tried salsify before but this soup was like heaven in a bowl. \u00a0Kind of a nutty creamy soup with very little crab, but the flavor was out of control delish. \u00a0Seafoody but also kinda nutty. \u00a0  (It reminds me of that soup my family ate several decades ago after the rained out Anne Murray concert at Busch Gardens, but no one wants to hear an Anne Murray story.)  Price is a little steep but if you can afford it, get some kickass seafood here. \u00a0We were also told that the menu is slowly changing to accommodate the new chef so if you didn't love your meal before, you may wanna give this place another try.  (Careful though. \u00a0If you're visiting as a pier area tourist, don't fill up here cus there's so much to eat EVERYWHERE.)",

We chose it because a friend from out of town was joining us and we wanted the pretty view of the bay bridge. A few years ago we did Thanksgiving at Epic (same view) and it was wonderful, but they were closed this year.   The service was terrible (1/5). We weren't even sure who our waiter was for the first 20 minutes we were sitting there. We brought our own bottle of wine with us and our server was more than okay with opening and pouring it but did not inform us of the $30 corking fee. Most places do this, so it was fine, but at least let us know so it isn't a surprise when you get the bill. Our server never greeted us, told us his name, happy thanksgiving... nothing. Just \"are you ready\". The thanksgiving menu was small and looked good, but they would not allow substitutions at all. We had to beg to get a side of stuffing.   We all ate the turkey plate they offered which came with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and a cranberry sauce. Overall it was okay (3/5). Nothing special... but not terrible. We would have been fine with the overall experience if the food was the same and the service was great, but since the service was so poor it was hard to say we enjoyed it. We also were not sat by a window even after asking to be, and tables remained open by the window the entire time we were there. The lighting was very dark, we noticed another table next to us didn't have a light over them at all so they were essentially eating in the dark! Our table was also very cramped so the overall ambiance was worse than imagined as well (2/5).   The best part about the experience was the bottle of wine... but that is because WE brought it! I know thanksgiving was different than how the restaurant normally runs but I don't care, I will not be returning.",

After we were seated and ordered our food, after we got out appetizers but right before our entrees another server brought us stale bread with freshly taken out of the freezer butter; neither was edible. I ordered the scallops with the Serrano Aioli sauce, the scallops were barely grilled and were completely raw. When I confronted the waiter about It I had two remaining and he said no problem. The plate only had 5 scallops on it in the first place. He comes back with a small plate with just two more scallops. It was a bit shocking because usually restaurants are supposed to replace the entire plate or take off the total, but whatever. The sauce that the scallops came with tasted like melted plastic and mayonnaise mixed together. The actually scallops had no seasoning, no salt and pepper or anything. They were quite disgusting. My friends got the fish and chips which they said, \"Tastes disgusting and nothing different from what we could have gotten from pier 39 for half the price.\" The prawn salad my other friend got was pretty good actually from what she said. The thing that makes this place the worst is that after I went home I was felling quite sick, which I thought was from walking so much since I don't have a car in SF. But realized that I got food poisoning and when I confronted my friends that had the fish and chips they said the same thing. It was horrible and did not expect and establishment that states itself as a place of class would have that happen. By far the worst restaurant experience. Also the server came off as if he was too good for his customers and always kept us waiting.",

    "review_text": "A bit pricey, yes. But what do you expect when you're eating along the Embarcadero?   My family was visiting from out of town and stayed at the Hyatt nearby, so we decided to meet for dinner here. The place is very charming and has fantastic views of the Bay Bridge, and there's also an outdoor patio if you want to sit outside on a nice day. Our server recommended that we get the mixed seafood appetizer, but we all opted to get various dishes. My cousin and I split the crab cakes and raw oysters, both of which were very good. For our entrees, several of my party had the whole fish: a whole (deboned) seabass stuffed with crab meat and topped with a mediterranean-type sauce. It looked delicious! I had the seafood linguini, which is made with housemade pasta. I sometimes regret ordering pasta dishes because it can get one-noted very quickly, but my dish was tasty all the way through and came with a generous amount of clams, mussels, crab meat, and lobster meat. Another member of our party had the halibut, and cleaned off her whole plate.   We were all too stuffed for dessert, so I can't give any insight there. If you have family members visiting, this is a great place to take them! Make sure you take some photos on the patio. Our server also came out to tell my uncle that the gratuity had already been included, so he had actually tipped twice. Honest staff is hard to come by! I am definitely coming back here for happy hour or to grab drinks at the bar.",

I made reservations for brunch for an out of town guest because we wanted something on the water with a decent view. We were the only table in our section, except for a couple at another table. They poured water for us right away, then asked us what we wanted to drink. We asked for one regular coffee and one decaf.   15 minutes went by. No coffee. Then when they did bring the coffee, they brought two regular coffees. We reminded him we wanted one decaf. Then the waiter takes our order. Ten minutes go by. Decaf finally comes, along with our food. (Read: coffee took longer than food. What??)   Two busboys were standing with their backs to us in our section, joking and chatting. We said \"excuse me\" three times to get their attention to bring us salt and pepper. (There wasn't any already on the table.) They didn't turn around, despite an increase in volume while we tried to get their attention. Then a third busboy, who was walking past, saw our facial expressions and immediately asked what he could get for us.   The food was pretty good at first, but a busboy came by (one of the ones who had his back to us while chatting with a co-worker) \u00a0to pour some more water and spilled it all over my plate. I moved it out of the way before it could destroy my meal but my home fries were a total loss.   We didn't see our waiter again until our plates were mostly empty. As they were cleaning the table, they started piling plates on top of my guest's plate. After there was a stack in front of her, they took everything away.   I won't be going back.",

The restaurant was not very busy but since there weren't many servers working, there was a wait at 330pm in the afternoon, but not too long.  We sat on the covered indoor patio and enjoyed the view. Our server was friendly and efficient, and everyone thought the food was good but overpriced.   Not a bad place if you're in the area and hungry, but I think the other restaurant with a view, just across the Bay from Waterfront in Berkeley --Skates-- is a better bet for your money",

Nice appetizer with a nice strong tomato flavor while not being too tart or bitter. It really gets your apetite ready for the rest of the meal.  Entree: Local sole piccata with with yukon mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans.  The sole was well cooked and nicely complimented by the mashed potatoes while the green beans were cooked perfectly (not soggy or raw in the slightest). My only critique would be that they could've seared the outside of the sole a bit to give it more character.  Dessert: Creme brulee.  Waterfront's interpretation of this dessert while not wrong is textured a tad bit lighter than I would like however what they lack in texture within the custard base they make up for with a well done caramel crisp entwined with the tartness of the fresh fruit. I would recommend this dessert as my goto.",

    "review_text": "You know...it's one of those places that looks just so promising. You walk in and see the lights on the piers through the huge windows. You see business-types coming in as the financial district winds down. It seems like a perfect place to take a girl on a date. Wonderfully located on the waterfront (as the name suggests), you think \"nice...this place looks like it'll be tight!\"  And that's when things start to go downhill. And the fact that it just doesn't live up to this great feeling that you had when you walked in just makes it all the worse. The wait staff is friendly but absent minded. But I can look past that. The food, however, is the biggest disappointment. You just expect more from a place on the water that looks this classy.  Grievances: 1. Waiter forgot my mojito - twice 2. Waiter brought me my appetizer of a half dozen oysters on a half shell - and in the process of transferring the plate from his hand to my table, spilled some of the vinegar and oyster juice all over my friend's hand. 3. Two of the 6 oysters were about the size of a dime. The shell was smaller than a quarter....wtf?  I could go on, but my disappointment dissipates my enthusiasm for writing more about this place. Maybe if you read this review and your expectations are low, you'll end up liking it. Who knows?",

Great bites of lobster and delicious creamy risotto. Yummm! Also shared the grilled romaine salad, excellent! They were nice to split both for us. Then for main courses, we had the halibut and the snapper. Both were perfectly moist and tasty with great sides included. The ambiance is nice because the tables are far enough apart it never gets too noisy, and the view on the covered, heated outside deck is one of the best in SF. This is a great choice for any event, romantic or business. And, the service was prompt and very courteous. I highly recommend Waterfront!",

    "review_text": "Saturday night dinner. It seemed like the process of ordering was a bit choppy. Several other reviews indicate the restaurant was understaffed, and at our dinner, while there were plenty of runners and busboys, only maybe two or three waitstaff?   Our waitress was perky and friendly when talking to us, but not overly helpful as I asked questions about menu items that clearly indicated I was trying to avoid lemon. I was dining with my sister-in-law and brother. Our apps were fine, seemed to take a long time for main courses to come out. My SIL ordered one dish but found food mixed in it that clearly didn't belong. While we were eating our waitress never came by to ask how everything was. \u00a0  Busboys cleared our plates, and eventually the waitress appeared, announced that she'd bring two desserts and zoomed off. So the three of us shared them. One was a chocolate cake thing and the other was some sort of apple crumble thing with vanilla ice cream on top.   There's a certain standard you expect from non-chain restaurants in SF, and Waterfront didn't rise to it. All the food was ... okay. Except the desserts, which I thought sucked. But all the other stuff? I could have done it at home, just as well.   On our way out the manager was by the door, and my SIL went to let him know about our spotty service and the accident with her main dish. At first she reported back that he'd said he would comp the whole check. Then he came over and told her he would comp our valet. But we're local - we used mass transit. So then he said he couldn't do anything except give her a free drink at the bar or free valet service. She asked to speak with HIS manager, and he said, \"I AM the manager.\" Well, if you're the manager how is it you're all of a sudden not capable of reversing the charges on a credit card?   As far as I'm concerned, he totally ruined my impression of the restaurant. I could have chalked everything else up to being busy and understaffed. But the manager first saying he'd comp the whole check (which was more than generous) and then reneging and then claiming he couldn't? I won't go back, I won't recommend this place to friends, and think that manager is shady.",

The decor is nice too and the food was generally good. However, service was poor. The hostess was very pleasant, professional, and helpful. But in the end our problems with the server were not resolved. Our server was frustrated, sarcastic, and just plain rude. It was somewhat understandable since our party was slightly disorganized and we were confused about the seating (upstairs or downstairs which had different menus; upstairs is suppose to be fancier, where we intended to make our reservations, but there was a mix up and they gave us a table downstairs instead). But that still doesn't justify our server approaching us with a negative attitude and off putting demeanor (tone of voice, comments, vague and misinformed responses to our questions). I've worked in restaurants before and mistakes and mix ups happen. Usually in good restaurants they are handled well and cleared up without any resentment. However, our server did not appear to have let go of some negative feelings she had either for us or someone else. Overall, our entire table very uncomfortable with idea of having to sit through a 2 hour dinner with her. It was hard to determine if she was just frustrated with the evening since it was NYE or if she just didn't like us. Whichever she wasn't very helpful and dampened our evening. We spoke to the hostess, then the manager about our situation. We were told they would resolve the issue but it didn't happen. In the end \u00a0our server was not changed so we tried our best to not further upset the cranky server. Needless to say eating dinner with a server you're hesitant to ask too many questions, the wrong questions, or make comments to, is not good. Besides her answers were all incorrect (e.g. are we going to be able to see the fireworks from our table, which was next to window that faced the water, her response was \"Oh NO, the fireworks are WAY DOWN THERE, you can't see it from here. Everyone gets up and walks outside.\" In fact, the fireworks were right outside our window and we had a spectacular view). Plus she made little to no effort to help us coordinate our courses, cork wines, or refill waters...such a shame for a restaurant with a wonderful location",

We ordered a round of snacks -- parmesan truffle fries for one of us and oysters for me and my BFF to share. \u00a0The truffle fries were $5 for a teensy little serving....but it came with the cutest, wee ketchup bottle ever so that seems legit to me. ;D \u00a0The oysters were $1 each for happy hour, but they were teensier than the little baby ketchup so I'm not convinced they're worth it. \u00a0I sure as hell wouldn't order them here at regular price.  Drinks were good, the view of the bay from the patio was nice, and the people-watching along the Embarcadero sidewalk was amusing. \u00a0Service was pretty crappy but then again, when the majority of your clientele is tourist traffic, it's not like you have to work your ass off to impress people and angle for return customers.   The dinner menu looks good, but I'd be reluctant to come back due to the mediocre experience we had. \u00a0See, Waterfront?? \u00a0You could have earned yourself a repeat customer....we're not all tourists.",

    "review_text": "The breathtaking view and seafood here are right on point. The sourdough was nice and toasty, served with butter the way I like it. We didn't wait too long to be seated and we were able to get a table near the water without reservations (not directly next to the water because those were reserved). The dressing for the mixed grill (lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, and salmon) was delicious. The dip dressing tasted similar to salsa verde but was creamier. I guess it is called Serrano Aioli. The lobster Mac and cheese was the best I have ever had, I want to recreate it at home. Lots of lobster, not too much cheese and a little bit of crunch. The best way to make it:)   Our waiter lacked a bit of personality- he had a very flat affect. He still gave us decent service so all in all our experience was wonderful. I'm sure the server was just tired. I would definitely come again and next time I will bring my parents too for a family lunch.",

It's a little pricey. \u00a0Always possible to get a table here, but come to think of it, maybe that's a bad sign. \u00a0I will try it again soon to see if I agree with Diane that it has gone downhill.",

    "review_text": "Just had lunch at Waterfront after not being there for a few years. \u00a0Don't know about all of the negative reviews below, but the food was great and the service better.  I had the Cold Smoked Salmon, the Waterfront Cioppino, and the Strwaberry Rubarb. \u00a0The sauce on the salmon is a little heavy for my taste, but overall a great dish. \u00a0The Cioppino was absolutely phenomenal. \u00a0 There is tons of seafood in it: crab, prawns, fish, and clams. \u00a0Definitely worth the price of the dish. \u00a0The Rubarb was good but nothing spectacular.  Others at the table had the Spinach Salad, the Chicken Escalope, and the Chocolate Fondant. \u00a0The salad is interesting in that the vinaigrette is not a simple olive oil base. \u00a0The Chicken Escalope, interestingly enough, looks like scrambled eggs but tastes good. \u00a0The fondant is very heavily chocolate- good for those with a love of chocolate.  Service was great and view was ok. \u00a0It's the same view you get while standing on the Embaracadero (which means no Golden Gate Bridge views are possible, so don't know why someone's complaining about that). \u00a0The meal is pricey but the prix fixe menus are great choices, and when you walk into the place you know you're going to spend a good chunk of change, so it's to be expected.  A final note: they have a happy hour from 3-7 M-S and it looks like the menu is pretty decent. \u00a0Drinks and appetizers under $5 and the appetizers all look great. \u00a0Could be an interesting place for a quieter happy hour.",

    "review_text": "Ugh, what a disappointment. \u00a0I had a meeting next door one night and thought I'd head to Waterfront to check it out. \u00a0The place was frightfully empty so I can't figure out the bizarre service. We sat at the bar which certainly did not seem to impress the bartender. \u00a0He eventually got around to dealing with us, but was never happy about it. He did take the time to make a very large, very cold martini glass full of vodka for one of the other servers who pounded it before going back to his tables. \u00a0Hey, I used to drink when I was a server and having a bad night too, but never so blatantly. \u00a0I mean, he sat at the bar and knocked it back in 3 or 4 swallows. The food was mediocre. \u00a0The Brussels sprouts tasted way too allyl isothiocyanate-y if you know what I mean. \u00a0I HATE that flavor. \u00a0The salad was pretty good, but the pancetta wrapped prawns were so rubbery they were practically chewing gum. \u00a0If you're a seafood restaurant you could at least properly cook the seafood. I'll skip it, great location and outdoor patio be damned.",

If we don't show, we're charged at $25 per person totalling to $250 (aka 1/4 way to buying Heidi C. a LV purse). Heidi C. gives the hostess credit card number, and hostess says \"If you need to cancel, cancel at least 48 hours in advance. See you on the 30th!\"  January 26th, 2009 Heidi C. consults party of 11 and decides to cancel reservation at Waterfront Restaurant to go elsewhere for the night.   Heidi C.: Hi. I would like to cancel my reservation. Hostess: Name and party size? Heidi C.: Heidi C...party of 12. Hostess: Hmmm...I have a Heidi C. for a party of 2... Heidi C.: Uh...serious? Then why was my credit card taken down... Hostess: I don't know. You called at a busy lunch hour, that's why. Heidi C.: Uh okay, good thing I'm cancelling.  DISASTER AVERTED.  BEWARE. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR RESERVATIONS! Imagine if our party of 12 had showed up on the 30th to find out we could be seated at a table for 2!!!",
