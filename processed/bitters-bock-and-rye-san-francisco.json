Aside from just being rad people the bar itself rocks. The space is huge and there are three separate rooms. The whole of the inside has this dark wood sophistication thing going on. Also, many of the drinks also have a dark wood sophistication thing happening. The food was innovative and traditional at the same time. Make no mistake, this place is the real deal.   Highly recommend for an evening out and extra recommend as an event space. They were accommodating and make the whole process a snap. We couldn't have been happier.  I will definitely be returning here, especially during their happy hour.",

    "review_text": "Very BITTER experience at Bitters, Bock and Rye in SF. \u00a0I give the lady bartender, Jules, the 1 star (she deserves 5 stars, but not her boss). \u00a0I am a professional in my late 40s, and my rawdy days are well behind me, so after meeting up with some friends, on the Thurs night before Holloween, spotted this seemingly pleasant place as I walked by. \u00a0It was quite nice at first, and I sat at the back bar on the Post St side for a nightcap. \u00a0As mentioned, Jules was the bartender, and she was very nice and very polite and very professional. \u00a0Everything that her boss is not, as it turned out. I had a lovely time chatting with Jules and some of the other patrons, so I ordered a late night snack and had a couple of drinks.  The menu is supposed to be \"Texas Bar B Q\", but having grown up in Texas, I can tell you it is very far off the mark. \u00a0I never tasted ribs in my life that were as bland as these. I did get good service from Jules, and when I asked them to make something not on the menu, but with ingredients on the menu, they did so. \u00a0So far so good.  Then at about 11pm. Jules told us she had to close the back bar, and asked if we would all move up to the front bar. \u00a0By then it was just myself and 1 other patron, and the others left. \u00a0I have a bad back from a car crash some time ago, and when I stood up I had painful back spasms. \u00a0I walked to the front bar, which was totally emply except for 1 bartender with a dark beard and 2 or 3 customers near the front door, all the way on the other side of a large room from where I was. \u00a0I tossed my jacket on an empty table and leaned against the bar for support, hoping the back spasms would go away. \u00a0Suddenly a loud mouthed psycho black bearded bartender started screaming at me like a petualtnt toddler throwing a fit. \u00a0He was at least 20 to 25 feet away on the other side of the room, and he was screaming at the top of his lungs. \u00a0I tried to explain the situaiton, but every time I tried to speak he interrupted me, and kept yelling at me, and accusing me of \"throwing things.\" \u00a0Not wishing to argue with a clearly deranged person, I just ignored him until he finally stopped screaming, and shut up. \u00a0I walked back towards the back bar where Jules was closing up, and asked her if she would tell the petulant bartender what I was drinking and ask him to stop yelling at me and not to treat me in that manner. She told me he was the MANAGER, and that all the staff was afraid of him. She went up to him and said something to him I did not hear. \u00a0Suddenly, the psycho started screaming at both myself and her. \u00a0I got my coat and started leaving, and he again started falsely accusing me of \"throwing things\", and when I said I simply tossed my jacket on an empty table and he \"went off\" for no reason, he yelled \"your outta here.\" \u00a0Well, duh, I had already put on my coat and was walking towards the door, but I guess it boosted his bitter little ego to make himself think he \"threw me out\" instead of lost a paying customer. \u00a0Jules, apologized to me as I was leaving, and she seemed mortified. \u00a0I walked out on Polk Street, and it was very crowded on the night before Holloween at about 11:30. \u00a0ALL the bars on Polk were crowded, except this one. \u00a0IF the owner wants to know why he is losing money on what should have been a busy night, he need only look to his psycho black bearded Manager.  PS, Jules was super nice, but the Manager was so psycho, it did not surprise me to see another reviewer state that one of the male employees at Bitters PUNCHED his friend in the face for no good reason.",

I told her my friend and I wouldn't be eating dinner until very late at night, so she told me they would package everything up separately for easy reheating. I got my food quickly and with no problems.  When I opened up the packages, I was freaked out. Each order of lean brisket was 3 slices, 1\" x 4\". Not nearly enough for two hungry people.   The order of corn bread, which was described to me as a, \"huge piece\", was 2\" square. Not even enough for ONE person, let alone two.   I knew in advance that the Collard Greens with Ham Hock weren't going to work for my friend, because he doesn't eat pork AT ALL, but the beans??? I couldn't use those because THEY had pork. Might have been nice to have that on the menu somewhere?  Okay, so I am making my own Corn Bread, and ran out into the dark night to find baked beans with no pork.  But, DUDE. I paid $60.00 for that food, now I am making half of my own dinner anyway.",

The service was just ok which didn't help to redeem the menu availability shortcomings. Our server was a nice guy but not attentive enough... to the point that a couple times we needed to remind him of the round of beers that we had ordered 10-15 minutes ago.

We all liked that the dining area wasn't too loud to talk. I hate when we're out with friends, and we have to scream to have a conversation.  Everyone had different drinks, some were better than others. My friend loved the maple/bacon old fashioned, I tried it and was not a fan.  The smoked pork and brisket were both reasonably lean and not greasy, (which is my preference) but had very little flavor. The fries that came with it weren't crispy enough either.  The big winner was the hush puppies. Granted , i haven't had many hush puppies, but these were fantastic. I really wish the meats had been better, then I could have the hush puppies again. Hush puppies alone are not enough reason to return to a restaurant for me.  Unfortunately, this was a disappointing meal. Will not be back.",

First time I went in there, back in April, I had an amazing BBQ experience. \u00a0The ribs were fall off the bone, the sauces were great, the sides were delicious, the drinks were solid, etc. \u00a0Amazing first impression! And ever since then:  *\u00a0Full rack of ribs, corn on the cob and a side started out at around $10. * Then full rack of ribs, etc. went up to $12. \u00a0 * Then became a half rack of ribs, etc. for $14.   Now that's just cost wise. \u00a0Other things that have happened when I have been in there:  * Out of ribs. Twice. \u00a0On weekdays, early evening. * Incredibly overcooked pork sando. * Disastrously tough brisket sando. * Bad sides dishes, etc.  I have probably been in there a total of eight times now and there always seems to be something wrong. \u00a0But the latest event, last night, topped it off. \u00a0Went in around 8:30. \u00a0Wanted to grab a sandwich, check out the new front space addition that had opened, etc. \u00a0  * Half rack of ribs + sides is now $19.75. \u00a0No thanks. * Opted for the sliced brisket. \u00a0Out of it. *\u00a0Tried for chopped brisket. \u00a0Out of it. \u00a0  At this point, I was pretty much done. \u00a0I asked who the manager was, the bartender wasn't too sure. So since that was going nowhere, just asked what was going on, and explained it's been months of bad impressions, after a great first one. \u00a0She said that couldn't have happened, since they had only been open for two months. \u00a0Soft opening was back in March from what I remember. \u00a0But ok, I guess I was imagining all of my visits in there the past few months.  Bottom line is that I want to like Bitters Bock &amp; Rye. \u00a0I'm from Texas, and so I LOVE BBQ! \u00a0But they really need to sort stuff out. \u00a0Because unless I have been having just the worst string of luck ever in there, it seems to be very poorly managed. \u00a0Lots of room for improvement. \u00a0And I truly hope it happens. \u00a0Unfortunately at this rate, they've lost me for now!

Inside the room has a classy upscale feel without pretension. \u00a0If you like the decor style of Rye or the Hi-Low Club, you'll love this place. \u00a0The TV's haven't been installed yet, but rumor has it there are gonna be 4 large flat screens in the near future.  The drinks - full bar (of course!) and lots of beer! \u00a0Sitting right behind the bar are two large brewing... things (carboys? fermented?). \u00a0I don't know what they're called, but it doesn't matter; they're for brewing beer. \u00a0Craft beer. Right in the bar. \u00a0Holy pope hat that's awesome.  Food - A full on kitchen. \u00a0Right now they're just serving sliders and mac &amp; cheese - but I believe the menu will slowly expand as they continue to build out the rest of the space. \u00a0I had 4 sliders, and they were deliciously against my diet.  It's still a work in progress, so if you cruise by over the next few weeks, judge it softly as they sand down the edges.  All I know is this: If the current room is an example of things to come - watch out lower Polk, there's a new game in town.",

    "review_text": "Really wanted to like this place, but I guess you can't always get what you want.  Surprised my BBQ-loving husband to a lunch out here. \u00a0We live in the neighborhood and it's a definite change to the food landscape. \u00a0Unfortunately it sticks neighborhood rule of \"good products; lackluster execution\". \u00a0  My first issue is the space. \u00a0I made a reservation on Opentable, so I expected to be seated in the restaurant. \u00a0There are two entrances, one on Polk which is the bar, one on Post which I assume is the restaurant. \u00a0As you enter the bar, there is a sign that says, \"Restaurant take the hallway to the left.\" \u00a0We get to the hallway in the back and there is huge chain blocking the restaurant. \u00a0I saw the door was open to Post so I thought we may have to walk though that way. \u00a0We get to the door on Post and it was locked. \u00a0The guy, who ended up being our server, was nice enough to explain the restaurant was closed but the bar is full menu. \u00a0We walked back to the bar and sat down at an uncomfortable high top table with stools, no backs. \u00a0There was loud country music and TVs. \u00a0When making a reservation on Opentable this is not the atmosphere that I expect. \u00a0But as far as bars go I've been in worse.  My second issue is the food. \u00a0It was just... disappointing. \u00a0To start, we ordered the Fried Pickles. \u00a0The pickle itself was wonderful quality and flavor was spot on. \u00a0The problem was the execution. \u00a0The pickle slices were about an inch and a half thick and the size just made them difficult to eat. \u00a0For an entree, I ordered the Catfish Po'boy, which came with fries. \u00a0The sandwich was ok. \u00a0Again the execution could have made it better/great. \u00a0It needed more sauce. \u00a0The fries were thick cut but were soggy and the seasoning was bland. \u00a0My husband ordered the Brisket plate and this is where it gets really bad. \u00a0The plate itself has a lot of food, big side of baked beans and collard greens/ham hocks, with four slices of brisket. \u00a0The first slice of brisket had some moisture and lots of fat. \u00a0The subsequent slices were dry with the final slice, hidden at the bottom of the plate, looking like beef jerky. \u00a0We suspect that the meat portions had been pre-cut and subsequently dried out. \u00a0  I would like this place to really improve. \u00a0I do see your good side. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0Nice bar selection. \u00a0Nice location, hip area with lots of opportunity to make an impact. \u00a0I would love to see you define your hours for bar vrs restaurant areas. \u00a0I would love for you to tweek the pickles and make them just a tad smaller. \u00a0I'm seeing a lot of reviews with \"dry brisket\", can you fix that?",

Smoked half chicken might have contained a typo as it resembled a full bird. Comes with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. No problem swapping the latter for baked beans.  Plenty of succulent white meat made the four homemade BBQ sauces almost irrelevant. Which was a good thing considering they all had a kick. All for a reasonable $15.  Beet salad and collard greens rounded out the order. Enjoyed the complementary flavor of the former while the soggy texture of the latter wasn't really my thing.  Kretzer cocktail (ginger beer, bourbon and apple) was great and even better at a discounted $7 for happy hour.  Space is now fully built out and has multiple rooms and plenty of seating.

What I like about this hybrid restaurant+pub is that it combines all the elements of a good night out: classy dining atmosphere that incorporates the New American rustic look, stiff drinks, friendly service and a popping crowd.  What really takes this place into a new level are the three compartments that it comprises: The Restaurant, The Tap Room, and The Lounge Room. It seems they bought three bars and linked them somehow, because you'll be surprised to find a pretty distinct space and personality in each room. It's like three bars out in one! Perfect for when you want to pull a \"hey dude, I've been to five bars tonight already...\" *bro sign*  I haven't tried their menu besides the finger food, which impressed our group: - Sweet potato fries: spiced perfectly - Sliders: really good but small portions for the $ - Fried pickles: not too sour and very crunchy  I'll definitely come here again and recommend it for a din+drink combo on Polk St.  ---  Distinguishing factor: Three bar spaces under one roof.

    "review_text": "Nice, warm (sort of) early November Saturday afternoon. Sunny. Shorts. A couple of blessed rain clouds in the sky. The UH Cougars on the bar TV. It almost felt like Texas--which is what I wanted--a little BBQ--that stuff that's so elusive here in San Francisco.  The online talk seemed to say this place had us covered. They had ribs and brisket smoked to raves. They had an interesting-sounding signature cocktail in a glass rimmed in their house-smoked bacon. They had some sides that sounded indulgent. They had my attention.  The place is nice enough. I like the decor and the two bar areas--one is louder and more drinks-oriented, the other is more restaurant, yet still has a handy central bar. Neither had much of a crowd on a nice Saturday afternoon which, where I come from, is a sign of bad BBQ. So, in that respect, I suppose Bitters, Bock &amp; Rye is true to its nature.  The regular BBQ offerings were not really present on the Brunch menu (the first sign this was going to be a bust was a self-identifying BBQ joint with a Brunch menu). The only real nod was the brisket sandwich and a chicken one. The rest seemed to be relegated to the sides (which sounded excellent) and some Southern comfort food items that caught my attention. I was still confident at this point.  We ordered drinks. My companion got the jalapeno margarita. I got the Rye Maple Old Fashioned in the bacon-rimmed glass. Her drink was too spicy and undrinkable. It tasted like feet. Mine was good--I ordered a second one to confirm--I liked the bacon gimmick and the house-smoked stuff was a salty contrast to the maple syrup in my Rye. But, it was a small shot of hooch, really, with a long finish of pure syrup at the end. They somehow turned an Old Fashioned girlie. BTW- our server cheerfully exchanged my companion's weird margarita for a passable regular one.  Absent a ribs option, or BBQ other than a brisket sando, I (inspired by they syrup at the end of my drink) went for the Chicken &amp; Waffles, while my companion got the Chicken sandwich and a side of fried okra.  Her sando was dry and lifeless. Even that house-smoked bacon couldn't wake it up. She added some \"Texas BBQ\" sauce (it was labeled as such, but that was the only indication of \"Texas BBQ\") to it, to no avail. This chicken was way past roadkill in the dryness department. The side of okra with garlic aioli was good, though. It was long pieces of okra fried in a tempura-like batter--not Southern-style at all, so not what was expected--but pretty good. I liked it better than she did.  My C&amp;W was plain weird. It was okay, I suppose, in that it was clearly freshly-prepared, but not what I wanted. It was a huge, full, bone-on breast of chicken deep fried (over-done) in fairly lifeless breading that I assume is the \"Mother's\" recipe of their regular fried chicken. It is nothing special, and like I said, the sheer mass of this breast forced the over-frying of it to a dark-brown, flavorless, salty glob. It came with two thinner-than-Eggos waffles that were limp, lifeless, and FOLDED on the side, and a small dish of berry syrup that really didn't add anything.  Seriously, tackling Southern cooking like BBQ, Chicken &amp; Waffles, fried okra and such carries with it some kind of obligation to be true to the craft. It is often misinterpreted here in California as ham-handed, greasy, or overly simple. Or worse, as is the case at Bitters, Bock &amp; Rye, there is an ill-fated attempt to inject some interest into the genre with a twist. Nobody here does BBQ worth a damn (even though I didn't try BB&amp;R's I'm certain that they don't). Only a few get Southern-inspired dishes close to the mark. Why is that?  Whatever. Two stars for the nice waiter who didn't bat an eye at replacing the drink and served us efficiently and in a friendly manner.",

And, to be honest, it's not really a neighborhood I want to walk around looking lost in. Then, upon entering we're not really told where to sit for food or anything, so I assume it's bar service. Come to find out later there IS a dining room, it's just hidden.   Our waitress was very lackluster. She gave us less than a minute with menus and then tried to take our order. I told her we'd need a minute to peruse. She never took drink orders so I just told her when she came back much later. They were also out of the one thing I really wanted- greens. If you're gonna run out of greens, it'd be nice to have a substitute green vegetable around. Green beans with bacon is so easy to keep on hand!  The okra was EXTREMELY greasy. Obviously the oil is not kept at proper frying temperature anymore. I'm sad because the photos I saw looked dry and fresh with a perfect crisp exterior. Now, I'm not really faulting them for this, but the jalape\u00f1o aioli was not spicy at all, nor were the two house made hot sauces we were brought. I'm a spice girl, so that was kind of disappointing. Oh well, we've got mains to look forward to, right?  My lovely dining companion ordered the shrimp and grits. When it came out, I knew she was gonna hate it. It just LOOKED weird. We're from Texas, and we lived in Georgia, we've had our fair share of tasty shrimp and grits. I'm not sure what was going on there, but we each took one bite and pushed the plate away. Very strange sort of seafood beef gravy. And mushrooms! \u00a0On top of all that, it was barely lukewarm.   Well, maybe we could share my plate and salvage dinner! My pulled pork, mac and cheese, and hush puppies looked pretty sad, but I tried it anyway. The waitress recommended putting their house BBQ sauce on the mac, and that did liven up the bland, reheated dish slightly. I also tried adding more of that unspicy hot sauce, to no avail. The pork was quite obviously from a day or three prior. It was simultaneously greasy and dried out! Pulled pork butt is one of the easiest things in the world to make if you have a smoker. The hush puppies were edible, but came with a very unusual dipping sauce that tasted like oniony tartar sauce. My dishes were also lukewarm.   I was also a little appalled that they were trying to pass of a watery, thin sauce as \"Texas BBQ\" sauce. Texas sauce is thick and sweet, just like their BBR house sauce.   I will say, though, that the waitress definitely noticed we'd barely eaten, and although we did not ask, she comped a large portion of our bill. She received that portion back in the form of a tip.   I really hope this place gets its act together because it has amazing potential. I'd be happy to come on as a temporary consultant! I'd love to see it regain the vibrancy I see in the first photos and read in the first reviews. At least the Shiner was cold.",

    "review_text": "Where to begin WORST Experience of the Year for restaurant/bar!! \u00a0And the Winner is Bitters Bock and Rye!! I guess its called Bitters cause you feel so Bitter when you leave.   First let me start with the good walked up and no line which on Polk street on a Saturday night is unheard of, maybe that was a bad sign. \u00a0Even the Guy selling bacon wrapped hot dogs had a line. The Doorman was cordial and greeted me, I asked if they were still serving food and he said yes and to enjoy my dinner. Experience started out well.   Wait for it wait for it the Downhill is coming. Walk into the bar (ouch) plenty of open seating about 4 different parties in the bar and 1 bartender. I take a seat in the middle of the bar right next to the cash register area and search for a menu which was over on the wall near the back of the bar. Ok cool I had seen the menu online and was very much interested in trying the food here because of the creative southern food.   \u00a0Look over the menu for 3 or 4 minutes no greeting or acknowledgment by bartender who was at the end of the bar taking a food order from a group of 4, while looking \u00a0like they were wasting her time. Thought oh maybe they are just taking a long time ordering or something. About 5 mins go by she finishes that order walks by me still no hello or anything. Goes to other end of bar takes another order from a guy who came in before me bet he waited a while. Then another group of 3 people come in and stand near me, we wait there together for another 10 mins while she takes 2 orders of 2 drinks each. The people next to me are complaining the whole time about the wait and the bartender never acknowledged them. \u00a0  Add to it the fact that the bartender looks like she must have had the worst day cause she never smiled once the entire time I was there. Maybe \u00a0the poor bartender ate some bad seafood cause she looked just between anger and just I don't care. Finally she comes over to where I am and the 3 other people and she immediately goes to the 3 people before me. Does not say anything to them or me but just stands there waiting for the order. One of the people start to order a drink at which time I say excuse me I was here 5 mins before them the bartender turns to me and says hold on a sec. First thing and last thing she said to me.  By this time it has been almost \u00a020 mins of waiting around watching the bartender work at a snail's pace to fill orders so I get up and leave to which the bartender seemed relieved that she would not have to take another order. If the bartender had made an effort to help customers I probably would have stayed.    On the way out the Doorman said goodbye and to come back and see us again really, good customer service from him. \u00a0Over all I have to I cannot remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant / bar without getting food or a drink so this maybe a first for me. \u00a0I guess after reading other reviews that this seems to be something that happens here with customer service. At the least the bartender who can only fill one drink order at a time and has a big zero of personality was hired by a manager or an owner. Maybe she is the owner and just does not care at all. I don't know all I do know is that my snapshot of my time here sucked all around. Only highlight besides the Doorman who was nice was that I did not waste a cent of my money here instead I walked up the street to a slam pack Grubstake and was served almost immediately.   Management or Owner s need to hire more people or not. Maybe they make too much money to care about who comes in and what kind of experience they have. \u00a0This was not just my experience but the 3 people next to me had the same experience just did not leave maybe if they had waited just 5 mins more.",

In the meantime they've got a menu of signature cocktails and lots of good bottles to choose from, Racer 5, Deschutes, Blue Moon etc.  The bar menu of southern goodies is a work in progress. My friend's shrimp &amp; grits was a spicy hit, hush puppies served w/aoli too. Fries were probably ok but came out cold, as well as my buffalo frogs legs. I'm sure it'll all be ironed out by the proper opening All in all a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",

Beyond the front room is a maze of MORE ROOMS, a second bar, private seating, et al. Great space to host a private party.  My only critique is that the BBQ I ordered (a lean brisket/pulled pork plate) wasn't flavored/seasoned as \"deeply\" as I prefer. I use \"prefer\" because I probably just like dirty South BBQ and wanted to get messy. The smoke flavor was light and the accompanying sauces were fitting.   Hope this place takes off!!",

Since apparently HERE, if you ring up an OVER $200 bar tab and you ask for a damn water, YOU WONT GET IT! Nope, instead you'll wait 10 MINUTES while the bartenders are taking other peoples full drink orders! And if you politely remind them that they forgot and that you'd still like one, they literally tell you to \"Fuck Off!\" And yes, I say \"they,\" because not one but TWO bartenders told myself AND my friend, who went down the bar to speak to the other bartender, to \"get it somewhere else,\" too after we had been waiting for over 10 minutes!!! &amp;Seriously, we all know weekends are stressful in this industry and we tried to be super kind, we really did. But when we are parched and really in need for real hydration and about to puke because you can't pour a decent alcoholic beverage worth shit, it should not be our fault and we shouldn't have to suffer because you don't know how to prioritize in the bar scene.

I definitely recommend the place if you're looking for a less hectic bar where you can maintain a normal conversation, and not have to scream at a person 2 feet away from you.

Either way, if you find yourself in here, you'll definitely enjoy the well crafted drinks and service.  I first stumbled upon this place when I was eating at a near by establishment (Lers Ros) and was trying to meet up with a group of friends for after dinner drinks one Friday evening. After finally finding the entrance, we stumbled upon two different bars, joined together by an empty lounge area. This place was a lot bigger than it looked from the outside, and unfortunately, a lot emptier. But my skepticism soon drifted away as I had a sip of my first cocktail.   I had a Kretzer. It was a ginger beer mixed with gin, apple juice and old fashion bitters. \u00a0The drink goes for $9 here, which for the time they put into making the cocktail, it's well worth it. This drink was a little more on the carbonated side for me, probably due to the ginger beer, but if you love ginger beer, go for it. They were also playing 90s hip hop music that night, which is one of my favorite types of music. So I was definitely feeling the place and my friends were raving about their whiskey drinks. \u00a0  I had such a good first experience here that I decided to come back again for my birthday as I was planning to have a get together with a group of friends. \u00a0But we all know it's extremely hard to plan a dinner and drinks with a group of 15-20 people without dropping $$$ on the reservation and doing it way in advance. I talked to the bar and contacted them for their lounge area that seemed to stay empty all night. Since I was having my birthday bash on a Tuesday night (it's always a good time to drink right?), they offered the lounge area to me for free. Yes FREE! Typically free and SF don't go together, but again, maybe it's because business is not too great? In any case, I worked with Stephanie there who reserved the room for me from 6-11 PM, free of charge and made it a private event. In addition to that, we had control over the music and was provided an iPad to play music off of. \u00a0My choice for the night was the Hip Hop BBQ station on Pandora. This was a great idea and location since I wanted friends to be able to stop in for food or drinks at any point in the night and didn't want to make it such a formal affair.   For the food, I got the brisket plate. The meat was a little dry but the portions are large. I would recommend going here for the drinks and service. I'm not even a whiskey drinker by any means since whiskey is usually too strong for me, but I tried their Maple Rye Old Fashioned and it was amazing! Maple syrup with bacon on the rim? What's not to like. This is THE drink to try here. If my alcohol tolerance were higher, I would definitely go for seconds.  Im summary, okay food, amazing staff, amazing drinks (especially if you like whiskey).",

Unfortunately, the waiter let us know that they were out of brisket. Disappointing, but I could get over it. So, I decided to get some ribs. Nope out of that too.  At that point I was slightly upset but I didn't want it to ruin my evening. Fine, give me a chicken sandwich with a side of Mac n cheese. Nope, they don't have any bread left, so ALL sandwiches are out. They are also out of Mac n cheese. Seriously?! Over half the menu unavailable, on a Friday night in San Francisco?  Mix that with poor service and extremely inconsistent drinks (one drink would be super strong and the next one tasted like it was pure soda) and that was the last straw.   The manager gave us 10% off our bill, big deal. Maybe I would have given this place a second chance if we got 50% off but clearly they weren't in tune with our disappointment.   There are so many great restaurants in SF that are managed to perfection, so why waste your time going to one that will leave a bad taste in your mouth?  Hopefully they figure everything out, because it is a cool space and the food seems pretty good. They have a lot of work ahead of them though.",

Ribs had a deep smoky flavor with a dry rub, fall off the bone good, I mean literally, the ribs were falling off the bone, so tender I don't even think you need teeth to eat them. The corn was cooked to perfection, and the potato salad was delicious (the best I have had in a restaurant). My friend devoured the mac and cheese which comes piping hot in a cast iron pan, and the fries were some of the best in the city. I will say that the bartender was also are server (with little help from one of the owners who was mostly hanging out with friends at the bar) and she was working super hard. I think while they go through a soft open, they will probably be alittle understaffed, but its a bar with great drinks, a good environment, so deal with it. Let the food make you happy.",

BRISKET While all of the BBQ options are delicious, the brisket is the one thing that you need to try. Try to arrive early if possible, because they do tend to sell out. The perfectly cooked meat goes perfectly with each of their handmade BBQ sauces (Mustard, Texas, BBR and Vinegar-Pepper)  2. BOILED PEANUTS There are probably other places in San Francisco that have boiled peanuts on their menu, however we haven't come across any. They are the perfect start to any meal...  3. DEVILED EGGS Bitters, Bock &amp; Rye has 3 deviled egg options, chow chow, bacon marmalade and smoky pimento cheese. Try them all...    EXTRA CREDIT: THEY BREW THEIR OWN BEER!

Drinks were mediocre, though they seem to have a good list of beers, and a sizable selection of bourbons (with a name like that, safe to expect it).   The food, however - it's dreadful. They run out of things as others mention, brisket is dry, the pulled pork questionable and inconsistent (like they've kept it a few days), the sausage nothing to write home about. The beans and hushpuppies don't have much flavor or texture. The slaw isn't bad. But the real problem: all our food came out of the kitchen cold. How does that happen when there are only two tables of people ordering food at the time?   Service wasn't as great as other describe - not all that attentive. and avoid the maple rye drink with the bacon rim - it's neither interesting nor tasty.

    "review_text": "It pains me that I have to give a measly 2 stars to this potential top hit concept. Who doesn't like a place that serves a decent selection of bottled and tap beers, a comprehensive list of bourbons &amp; whiskey with BBQ food?  Came here for a birthday party of 25 on Saturday very excited to enjoy the evening. Started off well enjoying a Rowan's Creek straight up which was delicious and they bar tender didn't let the bourbon mix too long with the ice. As I think about it, I should have suspected some pitfalls in this place when they incorrectly spelled Rowan's with Rowen's... anyhow...  For dinner, I went with the Bitters \"Your Way\" Texas-Style BBQ which allowed you to select up to three BBQ items and two sides. Sounds tasty eh? Well, it wasn't... we attempted to order the fatty brisket but they were out of it by 7:30PM (WTF, there was barely anyone in the dining area before we arrived) so our final selections were three ribs, sausage and pulled pork with coleslaw and onion rings ($22). I also order the mac n cheese along with their devils eggs done in three flavors... chow chow (a pickled cabbage), bacon marmalade and smoky pimento cheese)  First off, the mac n cheese is terrible... yes, I'm going to use the dreaded word. It was borderline horrendous and the only reason I'm not saying it was horrendous is that I was able to at least eat it. The elbow macaroni is overcooked, the cheese flavor is barely there. Our serving looked nothing like what another Yelper posted, theirs came in a small skillet, ours in a plain white bowl. I can probably hit up Safeway and buy some packaged mac that tastes better than Bitter's rendition. $5.25 down the toilet...  Next up, the devil eggs... it wasn't bad. Each flavor was discernible in taste (exactly as described) and wasn't overly loaded with mayo. 3 pieces for $5 and you get to pick your own.   Unfortunately the main course with the sides doesn't fare any better, if not worse. The ribs were dry and relatively bland, the sausage was OK with a mild taste and unprocessed meat texture while the pull pork was inconsistent and also lacking in flavor. Some pieces were tender while others seemed like it was left overs from two days ago. The fried onion rings were nothing to write home about when they were hot, but once they cool a little, you can taste the starch in the breading. Coleslaw was decent, like the deviled eggs, not heavily mixed with mayo.  A friend ordered the Shrimp and grits, and that was also super bland. I know grits typically doesn't have a lot of flavor, but when you can visibly see the sauce generously poured over the grits, one would expect more something that creates a sensation in your palate. Nada... the bite I had had lots of sauce and two pieces of chopped green onion and all I tasted was the green onion... sad. The shrimp was slightly overcooked and bland as well.  Okay, so the food is bad, how about the bar side? I had the Palm Belgium Amber on tap served in a Snifter beer glass which is appropriate. Followed up with their Maple Rye Old Fashioned with the cup having bacon along the rim ($10). Interesting concept of trying to get the salty savory flavor mixing with the drink. I think it's a great idea but the bartender put too much maple syrup in it making the entire drink overly sweet as if I were having maple syrup pancakes with bacon... not my thing when I'm at a bar. And lastly, ordered birthday boy their top shelf whiskey, Jameson 18. I know this is not the best whiskey you can buy, but when it's the most expensive drink on the menu at $16, why in the world are you putting it into a shot glass?!? Poor taste in my opinion not befitting of the establishment's name. \u00a0Also, oddly enough... how does a bar run out of regular Jameson?!? As for mixed drinks, our group ordered a variety and after tasting some, you will probably find better drinks at Redford. It varies, some are good while others are a complete miss.  In the end, the great choices in alcohol and decent service can't salvage what comes down to poor execution in so many crucial facets. I hope they can improve their concept and reel me back in for another go sometime in the future.",

The place was pretty dead on a Tuesday night, but we're getting old and quite like that.  The food menu is interesting, this was the main draw for us. Everything was well cooked and came within a reasonable amount of time. The only issue is that, by having 4 barbecue sauces on the table, the chef seemed to have missed the point of barbecue food i.e. that the meat is infused with the flavor of the sauce through the cooking process. This was particularly noticeable with the ribs. A rethink of how the meat is cooked might have meant we weren't the only people dining there at 8:30pm on a Tuesday!   The music was good and the bar/waiting person was really nice (although this probably isn't too hard when you have one table to serve!).   There was also a good selection of beer, with the porter being particularly nice. It would be good if alcohol percentages could be added to the menu though as I think it may have been quite strong.",

We walked in knowing that it was a bar, however when we opened the door and stepped in it looked more like a dungeon; dark and dismal. We were told by our hotel concierge, that this was the place to go for steak and barbecued ribs. They said it was like southern barbecue. So of course we decided to trust our concierge.  Big mistake!!!  The server was attentive at times, at others, she was doing homework on the bar and it was hard to get her attention. The drinks were weak and overpriced.  The food was horrible, starting with the deviled eggs that had a runny filling and tasted like pure mayonnaise. Then the barbecue sauce was like water and tasted horrible, all three different mixes that they dared to call southern. Southern my a@&amp;!!  Of course the menu didn't even have steak and the ribs ended up being smoked, which the waiter neglected to tell us. The ribs were overcooked and left an after taste from the horrible barbecue sauce. We took one look at the baked beans and said no way. The coleslaw was purple and also had way too much mayonnaise. The potato salad had so much mayonnaise it was uneatable. We ended up paying eighty dollars for one drink, a beer, one appetizer and two entrees. Paying that money for the worst meal of our lives was extremely painful. It was seven o'clock on a Monday night and they had one other patron at the bar. This place failed in so many ways.  I wrote this review so I save anybody from going into there to eat.

It's huge, which is a plus in San Francisco where most bars hold 50 people tops in a long narrow space. I've been a number of times with big groups of friends and it accommodated us all perfectly.   Tip: Reserve the private lounge if you've got a party- you still have access to both the tap room bar and the main dining room bar, but you get your own space.  Sooo... the drinks are delicious, and as a whiskey drinker, I've been enjoying their crazy selection of ryes (uh huh, like their name). Their Maple Rye Old Fashion is a must try, as is the American Julep, or go classic Manhattan and you won't be disappointed either. I'm sure drinks without whiskey are good too... but I wouldn't be the one to ask about those.   As any good BBQ place does, they sell out of the ribs and brisket towards the end of the night so get there on the earlier side. This isn't one of those places that just reheats their meat and hides the dryness by slathering on more sauce, this is the real deal. Smoked in house. Add on the mac and cheese, fried pickles, and deviled eggs? Um yep. Do it. So good.   Overall: if you haven't checked it out since the grand opening, you should.",

    "review_text": "My friend and I were wandering around Polk St. a little buzzed up on a Sunday afternoon after watching some football and he decided we should pop in here to try the food. I live about 4 blocks away and didn't even know they had food! The interior is nice and the place seemed clean, and they had football on the TVs.   We were served promptly by a nice young girl, looked over the menu and everything sounded pretty good, especially for bar food! It was all comfort type food- greasy, fried, full of carbs and tasty sounding. We ended up with the fried pickles and the fries topped with pulled pork. I don't even like Pickles and I devoured them! They were seriously amazing. They were out of regular fries for the fry dish so we got sweet potato fries and I think that actually made them better! They also bring you an assortment of 4 different styles of bbq sauce. I'm big on bbq sauce so I was a happy camper, the mustard and midwest were my favorite! My friend got an Anchor Steam and I got an old fashioned- which had bacon on the rim. It wasn't bad, the bacon just threw me off a little, I guess I don't see the appeal there. But the drink was nice and strong the way I like it.  Altogether a pretty good experience, if you're in the area and want some tasty bar food I recommend it!",

    "review_text": "New BBQ in the Polk/Tendo was just what I needed! SF doesn't have enough BBQ places to start - the fact that is is essentially inside a bar makes it highly likely that I will be returning, often.  We stuck with the BBQ plates over the sandwiches. The chicken was fantastic, surprisingly tender and moist and good flavor. Ribs were not as tender, fall-off-the-bone as I would have liked, but still tasted wonderful. As for the brisket, good, but it got cold super fast and I think it took away from the flavor. Mac-n-cheese and onion fries were the best staples. Baked beans were not your usual baked beans - not super sweet, exactly how I like baked beans. Slaw was unique twist, not saying it's the best slaw out there.  Heads up to anyone trying this place for the first time...it's a bar, really. Not a restaurant. Service is going to be very informal and sometimes it will take awhile to get a drink refill, but the waiters are cool and at least will check on you.",

    "review_text": "Protip: the bar is very hard to spot. Despite the even number in its address (1122), the entrance is on Polk's west side (go figure!). On top of that there's currently no big \"Bitters, Bock and Rye\" sign to guide you.  I went there on a Saturday night for a friend's farewell party. I arrived around 9pm. Food was still being served. The ribs, pulled pork burgers or parmesan macaroni that I saw around made me regret my earlier dinner. I sure wish I had room for some of these.  Now to the drinks part. I tried: * the American Julep, a honey whiskey based cocktail. Delicious, with a touch of mint. 5 stars. $8 * the Ginger Strawberry lemonade, based on a strawberry Skyy vodka. Very refreshing, fruity. 5 stars. $9 * the Bitter Truth, full of Bourbon, rye and definitely more on the bitter side. Duh. Comes in a martini-style glass. 4 stars. $10 * a standard Gin Tonic. For $6, it was a strong-ass drink. Almost too much actually. 3 stars.  So overall the drinks are pretty solid. Order shots and you won't be disappointed either: they fill them to the very top. Waiters and barman were really cool. Bouncer wasn't (I went outside to take fresh air for a bit, and was forced to negotiate that he let me in to close my tap).  I really like the vibe of the place. Sorta dive bar with a classy touch. I'm into it! Definitely going to be back in the future, and looking forward to see how the place looks like once they're all done with decoration and final touches.",

There are plenty of tables to sit and a large bar area as well. The whole restaurant is actually split into two, but connected by a short hallway. Service was pretty good, but with 15+ people ordering, it would've been nice if they knew who ordered what instead of showing up with the food and shouting it out.  I split the combo meal with my SIL (we didn't get full, was ok). We ordered:  Brisket (lean) - fatty was sold out. It was definitely lean... jerky like. The seasoning was good though. Smoked ribs - it had a nice char on it, but still dry. Again, I thought the taste was good, but it was too much work to get the meat off the bone. Pulled pork - not pulled at all. More like cubed chunks and not tender at all. Sweet potato fries - really good! They're baked with a sprinkle of salt. Simply and delicious! Mac n Cheese - mushy and wasn't too cheesy since I tried it lukewarm. Shrimp &amp; grits - I took a bite of the grits and it was bland and watery. BBR (?) BBQ Sauce - yummy!! Really liked this BBQ sauce. Better than the Texas BBQ one. Gretzer (?) cocktail - really good! I had two.  Overall, great place to grab drinks and the bonus is you can order off a full BBQ menu. I was able to order half a rack at 1a! However, I wished the texture of the BBQ was more to my liking. It seemed too tough, but the flavor is pretty good. Halfway there!!",

I wandered around from room to room for a while looking for my group, awkwardly staring at people because I left my glasses in the car, and this place is dimly lit. lol.  There's TVs playing sports, but there is music playing over it. I don't know if Fridays are 90s nights, or if they just play old music all the time. Either way, it was a nice trip down memory lane.  I only had 1 drink while here, and I tried to get the most unique thing on the menu. Enter the Maple Rye Old Fashioned, whiskey with an orange twist, a hint of maple syrup, and BACON ON THE RIM. Yes, that's right, small bacon pieces on the rim. There are several sensations you get when smelling this because you get a little bit of bacon, a strong scent of whiskey, and also some kind of bitters or something that really threw me off. Overall the scent was pretty potent, and a little overwhelming, but not so much that I wouldn't drink it. I mean come on, I'm going to finish it. lol. Overall it wasn't a bad drink, and definitely something I'm glad I tried.  In addition to the 90s music, dim lighting, and bacon whiskey, there were waitresses here giving out shots and t-shirts. Thanks.   There is a $20-$25 minimum to use a credit card, but luckily the server let me use mine anyways when I hadn't spent enough. Thanks again!",

The food arrived very quickly (much appreciated since some of us needed to head out early to catch a show) and everything was delicious.   I had the sliced brisket sandwich with fries, and though it was a little tough to eat as a sandwich, I enjoyed it simply as brisket with a roll on the side =) The fries were great as well, and I loved the house BBQ sauce.

    "review_text": "Southern, modern, comfort food.  It was pretty quiet for a Saturday night, so I was a little skeptical with the food. When you walk in, you're directly confronted by the bar (so innocent but all so tempting). Seating extends all the way to the back, and lighting is more on the dark side. Perhaps a good place to go on a date?  Anyway, the waiter recommended their infamous Maple Rye Old Fashioned. Bacon? Can't go wrong with bacon. Except the fact that my alcohol has bacon. I was not a fan, and forced myself to drink it while witholding my gag reflex. I personally do not recommend, but you gotta try everything once in life (especially if alcohol is involved).   But the food was good! 1. Fried okra First time I've had it. Dip it in their jalape\u00f1o aoli for extra calorie flavor. The okra wasn't mushy and slimy as expected in gumbo, so that was appetizing.  2. Grilled baby octopus. A little too fishy for my taste buds, but my friends liked it. Chopped squid with a pico de gallo salsa concoction. Get it if you want some seafood instead of anything fried or makes a moo, oink, or cluck sound.  3. BBQ chicken sandwich Nothing memorable. I believe it's fried chicken strips? I can't even remember. But you get to pick a side, and the BBQ beans are delicious. I'd eat that anytime.  4. Fried chicken Crisp, juicy, and moist. This dish takes a while to make but it's worth it. Big portion  They also have a variety of sauces for dipping. Major brownie points there. Service held up. Our waiter was nice and seemed like he actually cared about our visit.",

    "review_text": "So far we have been in three different times since they opened and every time they have been out of what I ordered for my main entree so I had to revert to a second or even third choice. Major bummer. Also, how does a Southern food place run out of Mac &amp; Cheese ? That seems like a No-No to me. All three of these visits did not take place at a strange time of day either. I can understand running out of something later in the night but at 4pm on a Sunday you kind of still need to have Mac &amp; Cheese available (amongst other basics!). Seems like the kitchen needs to plan the food ordering/delivery a little better so as to not constantly be out of food. Of the three meals I have eaten here, everything has been on the salty side. I had meat items on 2 of the 3 visits and the meat was on the dry side both times. Asked for sauce on the side at all 3 visits and all 3 times my food was drenched in sauce. Scant amount of coleslaw on the pulled pork sandwich. Portions in general are on the smaller side but that is not an issue to me.  All that being said, I really like the venue! It's really great to have somewhere on Polk Street that serves food late (until 1am). Atmosphere is nice and dark - just the way I like it. TVs available for sports fans. They will be opening up the other rooms eventually and it will be quite a large place. The beer selection is really nice and if they ever get their own brewing deal up and running that should be a fun bonus. Hopefully with some more feedback and attention they can tune up some of these issues as it is a great spot for the neighborhood and something different to eat on Polk. I hope they work out the kinks and up the quality of food (and the quantity! It's nice to order something and have it available!). Perhaps pay a little more attention to the customer when he or she is placing the order. Can't say I'll be going out of my way to go back for the food after 3 average experiences but I would go for drinks again for sure. And maybe some appetizers (if they haven't run out!).",

It was quiet when we arrived, and the bartender put on a show mixing drinks, but it became very busy very rapidly.   Passable selection of beer, but nothing of note. They have food, but I didn't check for vegan offerings; looked like greasy bar food.   The 80s and 90s hip-hop was cool, but way too loud. Probably not a place I'd go again.",

    "review_text": "Worst bar experience I've ever had in San Francisco.  The bartenders Saturday night were extremely rude. I tried to order 8 shots, 3 whiskey based and 3 vodka based but I asked the bartender to dilute them with lemon juice or something sour, not sweet. And he laughs and says, honey, it's too busy of a night for you to not know what you want, I need something more specific. So I said just add some lemon juice to the shots and he laughs again and says we're too busy for that.  I am at a bar, did I get something wrong?? You should take pride in the drinks you make! Later, my friend closed out her tab and the card was declined and she said, how weird and asked him to try again and he said, \u00a0sorry, you're just broke. So rude!!! I was appalled and made a comment to a stranger about the bartender and he also had a bad experience. When he tried to close out his tab the bartender said he was too busy to close out tabs and he had to wait. The worst part is it wasn't even that busy!! we tried to go to the female bartender but she was also very rude; asked my friend where she was from and then just insulted her response.  Weird place and neither of the bartenders were nice. They made us feel unwelcomed and bad about ourselves. Why work in service if you hate people. I would never go back. The only nice person was the doorman and I feel bad that he has to deal with such terrible co-workers.",

The service was good and the prices were reasonable. The drinks were amazing! I had 2 rounds of the American Julep which I highly recommend. The other stand outs were the BBQ sausage, ribs, baked beans, and sweet potato fries. The bread pudding for desert was super tasty! Definitely going to come back",

The bartender was also very nice while I was waiting for my friend to show up.   Slowly, the dining area was filled with people grubbing, and the lingering smell of barbecue. Yum.  It's a very cute, intimate place. The bar area has two flat screen TVs and rustic furniture.  I love that this bar is very close to my house and a breath of fresh air to the usual dingy Polk Street bars. I'll be back!",

Definitely worth a visit, or a few. \u00a0  Recs: Fried okra- douse their aioli with a little hot sauce I thought for jalape\u00f1o it was pretty tame, but the batter and okra were perfect Mac n cheese- really great! \u00a0I still have a place (i wont mention here) back home that is #1 for me on Mac, but this is really worth having a go at. Corn bread- if you like corn bread you wont be disappointed  Maple rye old fashion- nothing need be added  They are relatively new and still getting things going but are definitely on the right track. \u00a0I think their menu could use 1 or 2 more choices for entree but everything they do have sounded or looked good.",
