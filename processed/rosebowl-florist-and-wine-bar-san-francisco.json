Why would you purchase flowers anywhere else?  Shipping out of state? \u00a0No one has better contacts. \u00a0  Wine. \u00a0Come see for yourself the fantastic selection of zinfandels, cabernets, pinot noirs, blends, as well as a spate of white wines to boot. \u00a0These wines represent small, family-owned wineries in the Bay Area; come support multiple small businesses with a single purchase. \u00a0You will not be disappointed. \u00a0  Need gift ideas? \u00a0Rose Bowl carries interesting and unique collectibles and other \"great finds\" that, well, you won't find anywhere else. \u00a0Truffles? \u00a0Wine Case? \u00a0Chutney? \u00a0Peacock lamp? \u00a0Diedre has it all.  And, finally, the atmosphere. \u00a0Come in on any given night during the week and there will be an assembly of characters exchanging stories at the wine bar located in the back of the store. \u00a0You could easily envision this crowd in a speakeasy during Prohibition. \u00a0There really isn't any other place like it in the City. \u00a0  The number of places that truly feel \"San Francisco\" seems to be dwindling in all corners of our 7X7 plot. \u00a0Everywhere, that is, except Rose Bowl.",

I thought to myself. \"tomorrow my girlfriend be so happy when she sees her flowers. She's just going to love them.\" because I'm paying over a hundred and it's definitely going to look better than Costco flowers. \u00a0BUT!!!! the flowers that my girlfriend received on valentine's looked a lot worst. They were horrible i still cant believe that it was over a hundred dollars. The delivery called me like 3 times just to confirm the address. Which was not necessary at all but fine lets just be cautious, ill give them that. Over all it was a horrible experience \u00a0and i felt it completely hindered a special day for a special lady. \u00a0  I'm going to upload the picture of the arrangement so everyone can judge for themselves what to expect when spending over 100 dollars at this flower shop.",

I thought about bringing her flowers or something like that, but she was so busy I might not have been able to catch her. I went to Yelp and on a whim I searched for \"Flowers and Wine.\" \u00a0The first result was Rosebowl--and my god it could not have been a better hit. This is a florist and a boutique wine bar/wine merchant. Are you kidding me?  I called and talked to Deidra the owner, who could not have been more fun to chat with. She listened to my description of the type of flowers and types of wine my wife likes, and boom, she came up with a package for her on the spot--orchids with a bottle of zin and a bottle of tempranillo. That's like a magical potion for pulling my wife to a happy place from the darkness of a stressful day. The package was delivered within 4 hours (probably less), and the wife is over the moon. \u00a0What a service. \u00a0 Guys and girls, take heed--flowers are a home run every time, but flowers AND wine are like a home run with a stop at second base to pound a beer....ie, better.

Call to order flowers and they'll know exactly what you mean when you mumble, \"Dunno, she's Swedish. Likes yellow.\" \u00a0How that translates to amazing cornflowers, peonies and sun-kissed wildflowers is a mystery. They have a knack for making it seem like you really did know their favorites, then went to the ends of the earth to find 'em.   Even better, it's A-OK to say how much you want to spend, so being sweet doesn't turn into being broke. Ignore the photos on the website. Simple, pretty, hip, dwell magazine -- they got it, just without the nonsense.  The first tenant in the Opera Plaza 27 years ago (perfect for a glass of pre-movie wine), the owner 100% rocks. In fact, she's been doing just that since she hit town in the 60's to make music and get it all started.  ... And if you can't buy your flowers from an original SF rock chick, who'll give Stanlee Gatti a run for his money, share a glass of wine and stories sure to make you laugh, blow your mind or both--really, where can you buy your flowers?

Deidra has a great eye for both the traditional and the unorthodox, without being weird. THIS is the shop I have been recommending to all my gay and lesbian friends now that gay marriage has been reinstated and NO ONE has been disappointed.

Can you tell I like this place?  Now...I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING. \u00a0 Yet ANOTHER five star review? \u00a0  Granted...giving five stars to everything ruins the legitimacy of reviews. \u00a0BUT the sad truth is that MOST reviews on Yelp seem to be haters. \u00a0The proof? \u00a0They shit on a place they don't like, but almost NEVER recommend where someone SHOULD go instead. \u00a0   Sad, because a gentleman never complains without proposing a REMEDY. \u00a0  So here is my REMEDY for all those boring flower shops out there: Rosebowl. \u00a0And I put my money where my mouth is every week here. I am flat out giving this five stars because I have tried every major florist in the city and this is honestly the best honest flower shop with benefits I have ever experienced. Totally worth checking out.  See you at the back bar, Trent",
