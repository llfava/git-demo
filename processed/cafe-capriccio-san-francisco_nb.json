They took a lot of the really great salads (NICOISE) and paninis off the menu and don't appear to have a special of the day which was always tasty. \u00a0   Trying to be an optimist, I ordered the Chicken and Bacon salad to go for $8.95. \u00a0When I opened it, I was very disappointed to see there was NO BACON. \u00a0It was basically iceburg lettuce, tomato and chicken for $8.95.

They serve it up with thick slices of mozzarella, tomato, and pesto sauce with a side salad, and I was sad when it was gone. I may have even licked my fingers. My friend tried the quiche - a bold move, since it's such a hit-or-miss kind of dish - but we both agreed that it was cheesy deliciousness.

Well for those who have never written a review, you begin by choosing a star rating and when you hover over 5 stars, the caption next to it says, \"As good as it gets!\" Well Cafe Capriccio really and truly is as good as it gets!  I first happened into this cafe as a North Beach resident out for a stroll, and since then, every other cafe &amp; coffee house has had to measure up to Cafe Capriccio.  The atmosphere is pleasant, and comfortable. On the walls, featured artists exhibit their works, local magazines and publications sit on the racks - waiting there to be thumbed through, and music from Pandora stations drift over the sounds of coffee grinders and conversation. There are a few tables available inside with more tables &amp; chairs available outside on the sidewalk. The workers here are friendly but reserved. Don't mistake their pleasant peace as anything more than an appreciation and respect for the personal space of patrons that choose to begin their day here. Come in, smile, place an order, sit, eat, drink and appreciate!  This little cafe is a crossroads of culture from the diverse mix of local residents, to the steady stream of tourists who bravely stray from their guide maps and happen into this oasis. It became a great routine to my day when I would walk in, grab a cappuccino and a breakfast wrap then sit outside and watch the neighborhood wake up.  I recommend the breakfast wrap with either ham, or bacon or for some lighter fare enjoy one of their well portioned parfaits. Go in knowing that their menu doesn't offer a full array of breakfast &amp; lunch items, but everything prepared here is divine. \u00a0They also have a beer &amp; wine license!",

My coworkers love the pear salad. \u00a0I'm not a salad girl, so I get the roast beef sandwich with cheese. \u00a0Oh, it is GOOD. \u00a0I also thoroughly enjoy their selection of vegan donuts. \u00a0Uh huh, I just wrote vegan donuts. \u00a0Try it before you wrinkle your nose! \u00a0They have a raspberry one that is yummy, and I feel slightly less guilty eating it because it's vegan, and therefore healthy, and low calorie. \u00a0Oh, that's not what vegan means? Whatever.  And the iced tea is SO good. I'm not even big on iced tea and I crave it. \u00a0I always add a splenda out of habit but I think I could definitely drink it without. \u00a0The service has always been friendly, even when I pout in the rare event that they have run out of iced tea.",

Instead, she cut up fresh fruit right then, at least five or six different kinds. Delicious, and actually worth $5, unlike other places. My only complaint? They insist on leaving their front double doors open at all times. I know it's California, but it is 45 degrees out people! Obviously the owner is nice and toasty, wearing a t-shirt behind the counter, and he doesn't seem to notice that all of his customers are still wearing their jackets inside. I don't think I'll be back until it gets warm out again. Their outdoor seating looks nice and sunny.",

The whole place has a great vibe, whether you're sitting outside in the sunny chairs, or inside at a comfy table. But the owners Tarek and Lisa make the place wonderful and warm. I love how the place attracts a diversity of people--- you'll hear Arabic, French, and Italian spoken there. It's feels so much more like Europe to me than the Disneyland version up on Columbus.

Because they're stoners, they didn't want to venture too far from their hotel (in case they wanted to get stoned again) for dinner or breakfast (stoners!). This actually worked out in our favor.  Capriccio is a cute little corner cafe with the usual coffee, espresso and pastries...but wait! There's more! Even a stoner can satisfy those munchies at a place like this. They have omelettes and salads and fresh fruit (yes, it comes with whipped cream, you stoner!). If you, like Matthew and I, are not of the stoner persuasion but indeed fancy yourself a bit of a morning boozer, Capriccio has your hungover ass covered with mimosas, too!  I had the fruit, boy had the lox bagel, and stoned and stoneder had the omelettes and something else. All was delicious and the mimosa had just enough champagne to take the edge off. Prices are great and the service can't be beat. This is truly a neighborhood gem. But don't drive here...just trust me on this.",

The bf ordered a chocolate croissant with a mocha and I ordered the breakfast parfait with a plain ol' coffee. These 4 items totaled around $15.   The guy working seemed more interested in chatting with his coworker than he did interacting with us. He didn't greet us when we walked in, despite looking right at us and hearing me greet him. His disinterest became apparent when he forgot about my coffee and was quite rude when my bf reminded him. It's a shame because the other two guys working there seemed pleasant.

The iced tea was freshly brewed, the italian soda tasted like soda water, and our water never arrived. When the food came out to the table, there was no chicken on the salad. We mentioned this to the gentleman who brought it. He disagreed before reluctantly taking the salad back to add chicken. It actually wasn't a bad dish, but the dressing was uneven - heavy in some bits, light in others. It was more the attitude of the server that bothered us. In terms of the sandwich, it was ok.

The cappuccinos are a dream and they only use Intelligentsia beans (very high quality). \u00a0Expect a little heart or rosetta in the foam. Yum. They're coffee is all french press, meaning it made fresh constantly. There is no decaf (because decaf is for suckers) but they do carry Mighty Leaf herbal teas.   They have a variety of croissants, including chocolate and almond. I wish they would get them from a better, local purveyor. They're fine but not exceptional like the ones you might get at Four Barrel or local North Beach bakeries.  The food is quite good for cafe-style fare. The sandwiches are hearty and the various entree-sized salads are tasty. You can get basic breakfast foods until 11am, such as bagels, egg wraps and parfaits. \u00a0They offer quiche with salad all day (or until they run out). The portions are great.  As of spring 2013 they started a weekend wine-tasting program Thurs-Sun in the evenings. Once they get some better storage for the wine and some higher-end producers, I can really see this taking off. For now it's just an excuse for the locals to grab a glass, sit outside and enjoy the evening.   Capriccio could make little improvements here and there, but on the whole it is a great little neighborhood cafe with nice people, great coffee and tasty food.

So going into Capriccio, my expectations were in check. At a glance the place looked great so I'm thinkin' \"heeeerrreeee we go.\" To my surprise, my unassuming paper cup was exceedingly decent. Huh. So I learned my lesson.  This could be a good place to sit and uh drink coffee. You know, there are coffee places that you can't wait to ditch, this is not one of one. In fact if I wasn't on my way out, I would have enjoyed sticking around. It was busy enough to suggest the coffee is a decent staple of the neighborhood, but not so busy that you have to do the whole circling buzzard routine like at Ritual.  So that's that. Not bad at all. One time that expecting less really did yield a positive return. Huh, who knew?",

Yummmy! They also have sandwiches for lunch but I've never tried them.  For the food and service, this place definitely gets 5 stars. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there have been a few times when I needed to get food to go because it was completely packed and because it could be a bit more lit.....But then I might spend hours studying there and they may never get rid of me.

This makes Cafe Cappriccio particularly special. I am talking about coffee, instead of indifferent froth thing with some liquid at the bottom.  This place is also good for breakfast/ lunch. The selection is narrow, but everything they make, they make it good.  The place attracts a number of regulars from the neighborhood, myself included, which I think speaks to its quality. I have seen one bad review, which apparently received a angry private message in response. The original reviewer assumes that this was written by the staff or the owner. However, I can surely say that this place has many loyalists and I would not find it surprising if it was one of us. (Nevertheless, everyone's entitled to their own opinion -- people can read and judge for themselves).  Other features: Great for studying/ working, many power outlets, free and fast wi-fi, quiet, cozy, friendly staff, fast with orders. Too crowded only around lunchtime. However, a bit on the expensive side. Definitely recommended.",

I would be ok paying their elevated prices if I was getting the right quality in return, but I haven't had anything that impressive yet. The lox and bagels (my personal breakfast favorite) was exceedingly mediocre and not at all worth the 9 bucks.... I don't think the atmosphere or cafe itself is that impressive either. Maybe I'm missing something, but I'll be sticking to other cafes in the area",

I am boycotting this restaurant as I have heard they treat their staff incredibly poorly and the way the owners conduct themselves behind the counter is far from professional.

I've been for coffee and it looked like a nice, friendly cafe so I went for lunch as well. I had the smoked salmon bagel with cream cheese, capers and red onions. Very yummy-- slightly pricey at over $7.   My boyfriend had their grilled chicken sandwich which he was very pleasantly surprised to find had hummus in it. The perfect addition :) It was $8.50 or so.   These aren't your everyday deli kinda sandwiches-- if you're looking for a slightly classier version of a deli sandwich, go here. Otherwise, head to Freddie's Sandwiches for cheaper sandos.   BUT, for great coffee with complimentary wireless, this place is unbeatable! All of their pastries are absolutely delightful and everyone here is really nice.  Plus, they have books you can browse through-- some true classics and some CA tourism books :)",

It was so good that we went back two days later. It was so good that I still try to replicate my breakfast there now that I am back home. The ingredients used by that cafe are definitely the fresh of the fresh, the best of the best. My favorite was the breakfast parfait. The hot chocolate was as equally delicious as the fresh squeezed orange juice and the multi-grain toast with the salted cream butter and real strawberry jam were out of this world.   I'm truly saddened that this place is all the way across the country and that I cannot truly replicate it's deliciousness. Cafe Capriccio is an absolute gem, not just to the neighborhood but to the world of cafes in general.

The reviews for Cafe Capriccio were good and although it seemed that most people were fans of the drinks, a lot of mention was made about the food there. Since it was close by, my family and I decided to stop there.   The cafe looked quite cute on the outside, but when I stepped inside, it felt cramped and dark and muggy. (Granted, it was raining, so perhaps \"muggy\" isn't the norm there). Other Yelp reviewers mentioned baked goods in their reviews, but the baked good display case looked rather empty. \u00a0Seating was extremely limited - I suppose people were working from there since everyone seemed to have a computer.  I ordered a caprese sandwich, which did seem to be fresh and was loaded with mozzarella - but even with fresh basil and pesto on the sandwich, I found it to be really bland and lacking in flavor. The sandwich was served with a side salad of mixed greens rather than chips, which was a nice touch, although the vinaigrette dressing was nothing to write home about. My meal was okay, I suppose, but it was a disappointment after seeing such great reviews and knowing that there were plenty of other outstanding places to eat nearby.   Everyone else in my family seemed to agree with me - their food was okay, but bland and nothing special.",

There's a first for everything I guess!  Before I even placed my order I was barked at by the barista. Two young ladies lined up to place an order behind me and all three of us were scolded because we weren't standing close enough to the counter. Thankfully the young man that took my order was friendly and pleasant. I grabbed my number and made my way to a table outside to enjoy he amazing San Fran sunny weather.   A few minutes passed and the crabby barista came out with my cappuccino. Again, she scolded me! She made some snide comment about how my coffee was probably cold because she was calling my number for awhile now. Um, you didn't think to go outside?!? It's not like this place is big or anything! The two young ladies that ordered behind me were now sitting at the table next to me, so they witnessed both of my scoldings. All three of us chuckled at how bizarre the barista's crappy attitude was and joked that she must be having a bad day. (On a side note, several yelp reviews mention this barista and her crappy attitude, so I doubt it was an off day) They decided that they didn't want to get yelled at by the barista so one of them went inside to pick up their drinks.   Anyway, the coffee is excellent and the food is pretty good! The outdoor seating is great along the streets of this quiet part of North Beach.   5 stars for food and coffee, 2 stars for service (the order-taker guy was friendly). Also, props for free wifi so I could sit outside and type up this review on my iPad!)",

The only thing keeping this cafe from reaching 5-star status is the food. It's fine, it's decent, but its nothing great. If you need a snack while working or studying, it will do, but I wouldn't make the food the primary reason for coming here.",

We shared the chicken and caprese panini and I also got a latte.   The latte was rich and super frothy. The coffee flavor was pretty intense and they put a heart design on the foam :). Our sandwiches were also delicious!! The caprese won by a nose, we both thought. The bread were nice and crunchy without being oily and the amount of pesto was just right. The mozzarella was fresh and the tomatoes juicy. The chicken sandwich had crunchy pieces of red onion, which gave it a zing, and the chicken was moist. I would probably ask for no-hummus next time, though.   Another great thing about the sandwiches were the side salad that came with it. It was very fresh and tangy. I think it's probably one of the best salads that I've had. Simple, nothing complicated. Very San Francisco.",

Which is why it pains me to give them fewer than 5 stars.  Their normal operating hours are until 6pm every day except Tuesday, when they close slightly earlier. For the past month, I've come in the afternoon on at least 5 occasions to find them closed early. As far as I can tell there's no pattern to this, and their hours on the door still say they close at 6. So it's very frustrating and a waste of my time when I arrive at 4:30pm, as I did today, and find it closed early.  I'd have no problem if this was an emergency once-in-a-while thing, but it's clearly not, and they haven't updated their business hours to reflect that.

Always introducing the place to friend in and out of the neighborhood. Always raving about it. Until now. It's been a while since I last came here because the last time had left a sour taste in my mouth. What was once a very friendly service became not only unfriendly, but but disturbing. And today I hit an experience that makes my body cringe with the idea of ever coming back and being treated this way, as if I were doing them a favor for ordering, as if I did something really wrong just for being there, as if I am were a lier. I leave the comfort of my place to go work at a coffee shop so I can have the convenience of coffee, tea and snacks made for me, but also so I can interact with others, smile and smile back, spread love and grace. It's sad for me to see a place where instead of that, I get contempt and scorn. A place filled with people that look like they are hating to be there and hating to have to do something for me.

Not exaggerating. OK maybe a tad. I've gone here twice now, and each time was great. We're so spoiled in this part of town- there must be a cafe with a block because damn if I don't need another espresso to keep awake, so I can go back to wine &amp; pasta tonight. What this cafe offers is a slightly European flair from Sapore or 901 Columbus. It also offers an affordable menu of sandwiches and great outside seating on a relatively quiet block for Northern North Beach. Note: twice, my companions compared it to Noe Valley! I kid you not. Glad they finally opened. And the wi-fi is very appreciated.",

I am happy to say that it is a true neighborhood gem- which is tough in North Beach when you're so close to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The current staff, especially the baristas, seriously know their coffee. Whether you prefer an espresso drink, or a drip coffee, its all amazing. Nothing beats grabbing a book or magazine and heading to Capriccio on a weekend morning to sit outside on the sidewalk in the sun, drinking a soy latte, and reading. (Inside is good too- the music is always delightful)  Minus one star only because sometimes I come in to read or study, and all the tables are occupied by hipsters on their macs leeching free wi-fi.",

    "review_text": "Ooh, a Yelp first for me. It's a real-time review, yo. As I write, I am sitting in a very comfortable chair in the front corner of Cafe Capriccio. And, of course, this is all made possible by the fact that Cafe Capriccio offers free Wifi (You get two stars for that CC!).   I've just finished the Roast Beef Chedder Melt (as recommended by what seems to be a very helpful and decently nice staff), I hope the staff doesn't worry that I am judging them, even though I am. They're doing a good job. Handling customers swiftly and with a smile, I have been here for about 45 minutes and they haven't even shot me dirty looks despite the fact that I forgot to put pants on today. (Okay, I didn't really forget. I have dubbed this day \"No Pants Friday.\" Feel free to celebrate with me.)  The crowd is acceptable. No scary people. No crazy people (which is a nice break), There's a baby. But don't worry, the baby is with his parents. It's not like he's just a random baby grabbing a cup of coffee. That would be weird. He has two people taking care of him. Hope they aren't kidnappers. Hmm, better get a closer look. The guy does have a beard, but he seems to be on the up and up.  Ok, so back to my lunch. I gotta say, it wasn't far away from great. The roast beef seemed like it came from my mom's oven instead of a deli freezer. The cheddar was quite melty and the panini bread was crisp, but maybe a little crummy for my tastes. But then, I am a super sloppy eater, and I was destined to get flakes of bread all over my hoodie. So I won't fault CC for that.  I'd love to tell you about the coffee, but I had to walk here, and I am a large man, so I was sweating when I got here. Therefore, I went for the iced coffee, which is pretty good, but isn't one iced coffee the same as all the rest? I say yes.  Wanna talk decor? I do. Hmm I am looking around right now. There is a very large painting of fish swimming around. I do not know what this means in an arty sense. There are some other paintings that make no sense. But they're nice. Then there is a giant painting of a rhino with zebra stripes. I don't know what this means either, but it is kinda cool. I mean, it's better than hanging up paint-by-numbers or your 5-year old nephew's (probably terrible) drawing of his family. They also have those lights that hang down. I don't know what those are called, but they make me feel like I'm in a trendy place. And that is exactly what I want when I am trying to be trendy in North Beach on a Friday.  So let's summarize: Free wifi, good roast beef sandwich, nice staff who don't subscribe to the tyranny of pants, babies with parents, art. So really, I have very few complaints about Cafe Capriccio.  I'll come here again.",

    "review_text": "5 star croissants and other quality eats &amp; drinks! \u00a0I can't give the place 5 because the prices run a little high to me - but it's a solid 4 for sure. \u00a0  CROISSANTS- you want these - especially first thing in the morning. Story round here: the owner wakes up at 4am to make sure these are baked fresh by 7am. \u00a0  This is probably the 2nd best almond croissant I have had in SF, a good contender for those in Marin County. Without exposing my dirty past here, lets just say that I grew up with mad croissant hook-ups in Sausalito, Mill Valley, Larkspur and San Rafael from establishments that cater to European tourists. \u00a0I was an overstuffed child with a mother who thought good parenting meant pimping European butter to me like I was one of her clients. And sadly, I've been bribed with food since I can remember - not naming any names, but I kept secrets for a certain baby sitter in exchange for bags of croissants from a touristy spot in Tiburon. \u00a0I hit em hard but I also flipped a great deal. \u00a0My point is that I have had my share of croissants and this ish right here is - bomB! \u00a0Worth blowing up for.  TAKE EM HOME FOR BRUNCH My girl sometimes brings them home when we prep brunch. \u00a0Anything within a block under $10 that makes me wanna sing, has the potential to become part of me. \u00a0I've been good about these until recently. \u00a0Your warning: these aren't sweet, but the toasted almond one can produce bad girl affects. \u00a0Butter, fingers, lips, hips, swallow, singing in public - \"pour some [butta] on mey.\" \u00a0Not sure you wanna hit this.  SCENE We have been neighbors for almost three years. \u00a0This is one of my go-tos to get stuff done because I like that my neighbors pop in and other students hang around to study. \u00a0They have wifi, outlets, pillows, and a fair amount of seating. \u00a0It can get busy, but I've never had trouble. \u00a0The staff is way kicked back even after a spill- I like that.  The music is always crack'n - a few times I have had to whip out Shazam. \u00a0I don't know who puts together their playlists but I would probably buy their mixed CD. \u00a0  OTHER FOOD &amp; DRINK TIPS - I'LL BE BRIEF Do get: mocha, latte, cappuccino DON'T get: regular coffee Do get: yogurt Parfait, salads, wraps, caprese sandwich, paninis, bagels w/ bacon egg and cheese, vegan donuts, warm baguette w/ nutella, pie, and pastries. Beer includes Big Daddy, Deschutes' Black Butte (love), Hef, Fat tire, Peroni. \u00a0Wine changes.  SPECIAL NOTE: DON'T get the prosciutto sandwich if you don't like prosciutto - no matter how bomb it looks. \u00a0Really, it's a beautiful mountain of raw pig, everyone else is eating it. \u00a0However, if that is not your thing - stick to your guns. Pulling prosciutto out of your panini here will get you dirty looks like you're sacreligious.",

Every good coffee shop (Reveille, Coffee Bar, Trieste, Beacon, Blue Bottle, Coffee Cultures, every cafe outside the US...) will give you this option, because this ratio of espresso to water is much stronger/better.   Tried to order Americano here in 8 oz cup (stacked next to register), even though paying for 12 oz. Guy/manager confirms and says no problem. I remind barista (and point to cup) bc it took awhile to get to my drinks. She also says no problem. But then starts making drink in 12 oz cup? I ask her to stop, but she says \"Look at the menu. An Americano only comes in a 12 oz\" and hands me a drink filled to the brim. Huh? Just use less water? I know it all sounds trivial, and it's not like I didn't drink it, but I just get irritated when people blindly follow procedures without thinking, and are rude in the process.  Bumping this from 1 to 2 stars because the manager was really nice. I stupidly spilled a second drink I had ordered all over the sidewalk, and he offered to give me a replacement. I thanked him, but said I didn't have time (it took 20 minutes to get these two drinks!) and that I'd rather not order again from that barista. In the end though, I have too many other great coffee shops in my neighborhood to frequent this place again.",

Since the inside was packed at 11am on a Monday, we ate outside on the sidewalk. A nice, quiet, comfortable eating area with very few distractions. I could easily have spent a few hours just chit chatting and reading a book. The unisex restroom inside was very clean (important!!!) and the workers behind the counter provided great service.   The food was also delicious. I got a Caprese panini with a glass of unsweetened ice tea and it hit the spot. The ingredients inside tasted fresh and simple, no unnecessary flavoring.

I'm from Boston, a place that has very few wine bars, so most of the wine bars I've been to are out of state. I've been to San Francisco a total of 3 times, Napa twice. I'm a wine lover. I'm a food lover.   That being said...this is one of my favorite places in San Fran. We came across this neighborhood gem a couple days into our trip and stopped in 3 times before heading back home, twice on the same day.   The staff is great, so friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable about their wines.  The food was delicious. We didn't try much more than breakfast and a snack, but the egg wrap, the oatmeal with fruit, the bagel sandwich, hot chocolate, and cheese plate were all good... The seats are cozy.  They have free wi-fi.  They played great music every time we went.  They have a wine bar. How many cafes do you know of with a wine bar?  Their wines and wine flights are priced right and their selections are really good. Not to mention that the $9 wine flight essentially gets you 3 full glasses of wine...or maybe we just lucked out. Either way, I love this place! \u00a0  If I lived in San Francisco, I would make this my neighborhood place. I miss Cafe Capriccio already and am sad I couldn't bring it with me to the east coast.   Do yourself a favor and stop by for some breakfast, lunch, or a glass of wine. You won't regret it.",

Listen, everyone has a right to their opinion but, really, if you're giving this place more than one star you're an idiot.  UPDATED 10/22/10:   Apparently, my review hit a nerve with Yelper, Pamela P., who wrote a compliment to me that read:  \"When you write a review about another city's cafe ( capriccio) make sure you understand and research who has the top 10 coffee in the city. you top rated some shitty cafes and probally do serve costco pastries. so please dont act like your shit doesnt stink. and keep your ass in LA.\"  Okay, first reaction: Must. Stop. Laughing.   Second reaction: Intuition. I can only assume this \"compliment\" was written by the management and/or staff defending this dump, which kinda square roots 'pathetic' by a factor of one hundred... plus five. I'm talking PATHETIC here, like the sweaty guys in the back row of the Pussycat Theater (So I've heard).  Third impression: Logic. Pamela, honey, I don't actually have to \"research\" anything. I paid my money and in return was served a cinnamon bun of sadness and a cup of raw sewage. I now have the right to offer an opinion on the sad state of affairs that operates the business known as Capriccio.   Fourth impression: Reason, mixed with paternalism. Pammie, my opinion is just as valid as yours, if exponentially sophisticated in comparison, if I don't say so myself. Where was I? Oh, yeah. You wrote the following review of \"Cako Bakery\" on 1/29/10:  \"This place is HORRIBLE!!  yes it might look \"nice\" and \"welcoming\" when you pass by, but there cupcakes suck! there dry and don't have a lot of good flavor. i was digging the fro-yo place that was there before. the staff is rude and isnt happy to sell cake! all in all.. something better needs to go in this spot. k thanks! :)\"  You see what I'm sayin'? Glass houses and all that. What, you never heard of glass houses? It's in the bible. Psych! It's not.   Fifth impression: Empathy. Think about test driving a spellchecker.   Sixth impression: Pride. I actually have a pretty nice ass. Really. You should see it sometime. \u00a0;)",
