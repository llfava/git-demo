As a coffee geek, it's a bit unfortunate that Handsome and Stumptown have not opened up shop closer to Northern California, but understandable - we San Franciscans are pretty spoiled with third-wave coffee options that are locally roasted and readily available. Ma'velous buys coffee from all over, which means that latte you order today most likely will be different than the one you order next month. You just don't know what you're going to get. Pretty cool.   I walked up to the counter and the girl was so welcoming and cheerful; she seemed delighted by how googly-eyed I became when I looked around at all the coffee paraphernalia strewn on the counter. I immediately saw bags of Stumptown lined up and was tempted to buy one, but I currently have a backlog of Four Barrel and Sightglass I need to finish first. I asked if I could have a latte made with Stumptown, and she told me she thought they were currently using Handsome. Even better, I thought, since I haven't tried anything made with Handsome (Los Angeles) before. A male barista said their current espresso was actually The Coffee Collective (even farther away...Denmark!) and I got really excited. The latte was delicious, a bit nutty, and noticeably creamier than any other latte I've ever had. The flavor profile was very distinct and significantly different from Blue Bottle, Four Barrel, Ritual, etc. I impulsively ordered a Gibraltar after I finished the latte and was impressed again. The Gibraltar was just as clean and smooth as the latte, despite the different espresso-to-milk ratio. Incredible CC roast and great preparation by Ma'velous.  If you love coffee, Ma'velous is a destination shop. Where else can you a) taste foreign micro roasts expertly made and b) also buy a bag to take a bag home for your Chemex? I'll definitely be back the next time I need to stock up on beans...",

Ma'velous is most famous for their coffee, but I went for the boutique wines and enjoyed squeezing into their little booths, separated by colorful etched plexiglass.   It's a narrow space with intimate table-for-two seating along one wall, and one large group table towards the back. You can also perch on the edge of the tiny bar, which boasts 3 little stools. They have about 7-8 wines by the glass, including a perfect French rose for $9. The vibe is pretty mellow, since it's off the beaten coffeeshop / wine bar path. Discovering it feels like a little triumph.   If you need to kill time in the not-so-exciting Civic Center 'hood, this is a great escape.",

Today's experience is Ma'velous which had me with just their name. Really, a great name attracts me like a deer to headlights.   I went full blown international this morning. If you like a shop that carries specialty coffee options then you should stop by here. They had 3 or 4 roasts I had not heard of before and were more than willing to talk about them and the taste. I love a knowledgeable barista on a cold morning. I decided to let them surprise me with something of a medium roast and was not disappointed. Sadly I forgot the name of it, something from Scandinavia I think. Not a big problem since I shall soon be back to try other roasts. The place is a total hipster spot with art, books, and music.

Drinks: I'm more of a person who drinks coffee only when it's really necessary to stay awake or I have a lot to do during the day. However, if the coffee is as good as it is here, I'll actually make an exception and have a cup just for the taste. The quality is amazing!

I was looking for a cozy place to catch up with friends on one of my return trips to SF and Ma'velous had been on my list for a long time. However, had a realized that Stumptown was just a couple of miles away, you would have seen me trekkin through the TL on a daily basis to get this brew!   Cute place, great coffee selection, fairly affordable and wonderful vino selection as well. Not too busy in the evenings and the kindly put up with my friends and I after a few bottles a vino and the excitement of catching up.   The only thing that was disappointing is that they don't have outlets near the tables so if you are looking for a place to camp out with your lamptop and ride a Stumptown high, this may to prove challenging. The barista was kind enough to charge my phone behind the bar though! Also the food selection is very limited pastries and \u00a0cheese plates. If you are looking for something a little more substancial I'd reccomend eating elsewhere beforehand.   Definately, a great find! I'll be back for sure!",

Phillip was so sweet as to answer a million silly questions ranging from coffee bean shipping methods to how best to spike your coffee. (Hot sake pour over, if you're interested.) We sat there for a few hours and the taste of the Ecco coffee changed as it cooled, constantly getting more and more delicious, never bitter, never acidic. In his effort to give us a full and complete coffee education, Phillip also made an espresso from the SAME beans...and it had an amazingly unique taste, almost opposite from the coffee. (The coffee was very mellow and nutty, the espresso fruity and bright...yeah, you try and describe palette tastes without sounding like a D.Bag, I dare you.)   I also ordered a mocha, because hey, I'm a girl, and I like chocolate. It was lovely and dark, and even with almond milk still tasted like a \"real\" mocha.   Ma'velous really is just that and I hope that San Francisco supports Phillip's awesome business!!",

Since returning from Italy I've amused myself by looking for cafes that will serve latte macchiato, and this place was a jackpot. The fella working the till was a little dubious, but when I explained it's just steamed milk with a shot dumped in, his lovely co-worker just went right at it, and it was fantastic (and even decorated on the top). I heard them chatting afterwards, decoding the eternal mysteries of cappuccino, caffe latte, and latte macchiato. The baristas were nothing but friendly, and the latte macchiato was so fantastic I think my wife is now hooked too. We'll be expanding our search!  On to the space: pretty spacious indeed, with little partitions between the tables. That means you might have a hard time finding somewhere to sit, but if you find one you'll have room to breathe and relax or have your friends crowd around. It's actually sort of a super-upscaled version of the crummy cafe that used to be on 16th Street (now sadly a hipster bar called Gestalt).  I left off one star because of the techy hipster vibe, not really their fault as it's across the street from Twitter but you'll need to be prepared to listen to others kvetch about their work or blather about startup financings, etc. A particularly annoying pair showed up as we were leaving; I gathered my things while my wife was in the rest room, and some overly friendly trust funder with a white wine (at 11:30 AM) came up to ask \"are you finishing up here\" (there were empty tables just to the right of us, can't you just wait a minute until we're gone?).

Even if your coffee palate isn't entirely refined, like mine, you'll know that you're getting a coffee worth every dime (Stumptown has easily become one of my favorite types of coffees).   The owner, I believe, who mans the coffee-making is friendly and always greets customers with a smile. It's nice to get your coffee from someone who isn't presumptuous about it.

Service: the barista was not particularly friendly but he seemed very competent, making ritual worthy patterns on the foam. But, he barely spoke to us.  Coffee: well, there was very little food here, just a few muffins and they do not serve tea, so we stuck to coffee. They also sell wine and beer. The coffee is stump town and it is served in heavy diner glassware. We had a cappuccino, above average but not as good as ritual in terms of depth. It is smooth though.

First and foremost, the (expensive) Kyoto Coffee $4!, was pretty overrated, although on par with, maybe slightly better than Blue Bottle's. Philz is still the standard. I found it irritating that the coffee was iced with a long cube of ice that wasn't broken properly, making it next to impossible not to spill it when stirring. Sure, it's nitpicky, but when you're specializing in one product it better be good.  Secondly, what kind of coffee shop doesn't have: Cream, Splenda (or any other sugar except brown), Napkins or coffee sleeves. Usually I'm never a stickler for wasteful coffee sleeves, but my cup was poor quality, and 30 min in I could feel it crumpling in my bare hands from the coldness of the ice coffee.  Lastly, I found the service to be slow and unfriendly. I asked the dude where Stumptown Coffee is originally from, and he said it's \"from everywhere.\" FYI Stumptown is originally from Portland but it has locations in Seattle and Manhattan. Apparently, they are widely known for their bottled ice coffees. As a small business, you should make it a point to know your products... but if you don't, just own up to it.

As I've said before, my idea of coffee is generally a vanilla latte, so I'm a bit out of my element when people start talking about the texture and mouth-feel of different roasts of coffee. But my ignorance has not stopped me from learning to appreciate a fantastic black cup of coffee. And a fantastic cup of coffee is the Ma'velous guarantee.  My travel buddy is an absolute coffee geek and went for the siphon method. All very steampunk, It involves water being heated by halogen lamps and copper tubes and beakers. It's also $14. I wouldn't pay for it, but it VERY was interesting watching the process, and my friend greatly appreciated it. I did try a taste, and I enjoyed it. It had an interesting texture. Look at me learning about coffee!  They sell Stumptown beans, which means nothing to a midwesterner like me, but again...local coffee nerds rejoice!   Aesthetically, this place is great. Again, very steampunk with all sorts of oldentimey lightbulbs. I dig.  One thing? Don't come here if you're in a rush. The guy at the counter likes to talk, and you can be behind somebody in line for a good five minutes before he even starts making their drink. If I had a meeting or a place to be, I'd be more than a bit annoyed.",

The bright red boiler is encased by glass and trimmed with oak--most beautiful espresso machine I have even seen.   What makes it such a great coffee bar is the palette tasting menu! They have six different brewing methods, including Chemex and Siphon Bar. You can taste house espresso versus guest espresso, or brew different coffees with different methods, or try the same beans brewed with different methods. Depending on how many you try, the price range can vary from $7+ to $15+. All of this can be done with one of the three baristas that work there, which includes the owner/manager, Phil. \u00a0  The interior is carefully designed to reflect the coffee with a sleek and modern style.

Mr. Ma is not roasting his own coffee, but he definitely knows how to pick out top-of-the-crop bags of beans - in a way that allows you to think of yourself as true out-of-SF coffee feinschmecker, Palatably, Ma is also a Ma'ster-barista... Well I'm sure you got that I love the coffee....  Why not 5 stars then you ask? (on my tenth visit: decided this place really merits 5 stars)  Well, I'll tell you: My main quip is the water situation. I don't know about you but after five Americanos I tend to get a little dry in the mouth. This is when I go on the lookout for a water pitcher. So, to cut to the chase: Ma has no pitcher, no mug nor even a self-service water-well. When you eventually despair and ask for water, Ma goes out back for the precious liquid.   Other things which make me less enthused are only reflections of Ma's choices that may make life less than perfect for me but which I can accept: No WIFI. No outlets. No sweet-talk from the owner, (Ma's nice, but not in the effusive way). Not crazy about the music either, but it is definitely thought out.   Oh, and the restroom is too dark, so it's hard to check out whether you are pretty...",

They told us how they visited one of the coffee farms in Costa Rica, talked about the different flavors, and processes for making good coffee and espresso, and they explained all the machines/contraptions they have. We had a siphoned coffee which was smooth and delicious, and an amazing espresso. They also gave us a cup of drinking chocolate on the house. The chocolate comes from a local artisan chocolate company, and it was divine. The owner went to great lengths to source everything they serve - it is all fair trade and organic. They offer cheese from cowgirl creamery - one of my favorites. The atmosphere is calm and inviting with artwork commissioned by a local artist. To top it all off, I have to give these folks kudos for opening businesses in our empty storefront area of Market Street. They are bringing life to this otherwise baron area. I can't wait to go back often for really good coffee and a friendly atmosphere.",

But nevertheless we arranged to meet in downtown and go to the gallery.  I read about Mavelous on Yelp and wanted to check it out, but somehow never made it there as it is in a part of town that I rarely go. So, I suggested Romain Colignon that we walk to the gallery since it was a really nice sunny afternoon and stop by Mavelous for coffee so that I could revitalize myself with caffeine.  It is not easy to notice this place as it is nestled in between shops with no visible sign or prominent entrance. But once we were inside we both fell in love with the decor. The space is very stylish and kind of reminiscent of art deco caf\u00e9s of Montreal and Paris. The photos on Yelp give the illusion that it is a big space but it's not, however their coffee is good and the owner Phillip who also happens to be the barista is a super nice guy. I'll definitely go there again with a good book or with some friends to enjoy their coffee and pastries. This is a San Francisco gem and deserves our support.",

I can tell the coffee beans were superior quality as the taste was bold, rich, and nutty with no bitter aftertaste like some generic coffees can taste like. *CoughStarbucksCough*  9:15 AM - Starts sipping my Kyoto Ice Coffee 9:30 AM - Things starts looking sharper 9:45 AM - Types faster 10:00 AM - Bangs on the keys of the keyboard as if I'm playing Warcraft 10:15 AM - Speedwalking down the aisles in the office 10:30 AM - Starts chanting like an auctioneer: \"One dollar bid, now two, now two, will ya' give me two?

The caffeine high lasted for hours (till 8 PM) and the best thing is I NEVER crashed. NO headaches. NO tiredness. NO lethargy. UNBELIEVABLE.

I went with the Columbian and it was absolutely Maaaaahhhhhvelous. Don't you dare put anything in it because it is naturally smooth, light and creamy on its own.   I stopped by again to try their cappuccino and it was definitely, definitely much better than my first cup a few weeks back. I had a feeling the first cup wasa \u00a0fluke since the capps ive gotten from Lunch Geek were fabulous.   I honestly think that their coffee is as good, of not better, as BBC. No joke.

But owner and chief barista Phillip Mah established this combination coffee and wine bar quietly, so quietly that I didn't even notice there was a quality caffeine alternative to the pair of Starbucks on the next two blocks. I happened by it on my stroll back from Hayes Valley. There was a large group in the middle of the bar, but the window seats were surprisingly empty. I thought I should take advantage and take a quick coffee break. The interior is retro-cool with period furniture that looks like it was purchased at an art deco store down the street.   The pressed tin ceiling, the drop fixtures, the mural, the dark woods - all of it conjures up images of a Depression-era speakeasy but peppered with state-of-the-art machinery like a custom-made La Marzocco espresso machine, a manual Hario V60 coffee drip, a Chemex coffee maker, a French press, a Japanese siphon coffee brewing machine, and a Kyoto cold slow-drip coffee maker. I was thrilled to see first on their menu a $3 cup of Stumptown Ethiopia Nano Challa with a peach-pear-cinnamon flavor (see photo). Smooth and rich. It's Stumptown after all. Enough said. I parked myself at the window and remained as still as an Edward Hopper painting at my full discretion. I'll be back.  COFFEE - 5 stars...mmmm, Stumptown AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...nice period touches really make this space feel cozy SERVICE - 4 stars...nice and patient TOTAL - 5 stars...did I mention they serve Stumptown coffee here?",

I split a cup with my buddy and it was awesome. I was very unique. Not the best thing I've ever had, but pretty darn good.

I have but one choice - make a beeline for \"that new hot coffee place\" to keep the pleasant buzz of good food and good company going. And boy, did Ma'velous deliver.   This is clearly the new haven for coffe connoisseurs in the city. The selection of beans are unrivaled by any other shop in the city, and the care and quality put into the coffee is unbeatable. Philip, the owner and barista, pours his heart along with top notch espresso into every cup, and he'll gladly join you at a table or on the couches in the small lounge at the back to discuss coffee, wine and san francisco architecture. I also met several of his regular clientele, and we all sat down and discussed startups for a while. Kurt, Dan, I'll see you guys here again soon!   About the beans! I went with @mutdaline and, since it was our first time here, splurged on their Coffee Collective beans for a top notch cuppacino. Philip informed me that Klaus Thompson, world barista campion, runs this micro roastery out of Copenhagen, but I tend to believe that the devil himself roasts these beans. At $12 a cup it's more on par with a good cocktail than a standard espresso, but that's partially the point of this place - you can get coffee on that level! This was top-end beans that we paid good money for and yes, it was worth it! Ma'velous also provides more affordable options when you're not about to spend your weekly bean allotment on one cup, and by the looks of it this will be just as great. The only place that I know of that can match the espresso here is Blue Bottle. Quality wise, Ma'velous is first tier coffee.  Philip, the guy with the mohawk will be back for more soon!  PS: Clearly this is also a great little wine bar, so come on down for a classy alcohol experience too.  PPS: Look up at the ceiling!",

Consistency! \u00a0The owner has made my latte the five times I've visited - not only have they been identical in taste and flavor, but amazingly delicious every time (better than a Ritual latte; and on par with a well-made Blue Bottle latte). Ma'velous's espresso is great. \u00a0Also, he only has whole milk which I think \u00a0(in combination with his skills) greatly contribute to a perfectly crafted creamy latte. \u00a0Blue bottle is nowhere near this consistent and Ritual is nowhere near this tasty.   2) The music is fantastic - techno-ish? It's steady, fast-paced beat perfect for studying.   3) Owner is incredibly sweet and accommodating! \u00a0I didn't realize they don't open until 10 on weekends - we arrived a little after 930 and he opened his doors for us early!  4) There's wine for all y'all on the evenings. \u00a0Ma'velous unique and trendy decoration lends itself to a smooth transition from chic coffee bar to chic wine bar. \u00a0I have yet to make my way over for an early evening of wine and cheese, but the wine list has some options (not your typical Napa Cab) which definitely caught my eye.

Though I've heard nothing but great things about Ma'velous from friends who've had a chance to pop in for a delightful cup of coffee in the morning or a relaxing glass of vino in the evening hours... I just haven't been in a position to dip in and check out Market Street's finest new hole-in-the-wall until very recently. Or course I've had every intention of doing my darndest to spend some time here at some point, but the final motivating factor to break ground was when I learned they serve single drip Stumptown Roasters coffee every morning beginning at 8:00am. Even before tapping a single pinkie toe onto their polished concrete floors, that alone made Ma'velous one of my new favorite coffee shops in town.  Sure there's all sorts of great roasters here in our own backyard like Ritual, Four Barrel, Philz, De la Paz, etc... but Portland's Stumptown can to nose-to-nose with those cats in an old timey, bare-knuckle boxing match any day of the week. If there's one thing the Pacific Northwest does well, it's coffee, and Stumptown is a perfect example of their prowess in the field. If you've yet to try it for yourself, run (don't walk!) to Ma'velous as soon as you encounter a need for caffeine!  Now that I've essentially found my new morning ritual, I'll have to pop in after work to see if their wines bring about a similar giddy, childlike excitement. It's a really, really cute room chock full of whimsy, so I'm guessing this quaint street side cafe will quickly become a new favorite haunt of ol' Ruggeford H. Joesten III. Stay tuned!",

He is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about coffee. Definitely impressed. I learned a crazy amount about ph levels, water temperature, extraction rates, and the whole process in general.  And they have Stumptown beans! Yay! If they're brewing hair bender when you go there, just get it. One of my favorite coffees ever. I have been searching forever for a place in SF that has Stumptown. My search can finally end :) Apparently no one else in the city (and Northern Cali) is even allowed to have Stump beans at this point because they are sooooo selective about who uses them.  The coffee itself is delicious. I tried the kyoto cold brew since I had never heard of that before. Perfect on a sunny day! It was super smooth and not acidic in the least. There was none of the grittiness that I normally find in cold brews, yet it still maintained the same depth of flavor. Apparently it takes about 16-17 hours to brew a batch, and it requires an awesome contraption (see pic) that allows the water to drip through about 3 different levels before it reaches the coffee and drips some more ;)  They have siphon, V60, chemex, and french press as well. I'll definitely be back to try some of these. Most of the coffee options will run between $4-6 for a cup. Definitely worth it.",

You won't believe how good and complex coffee can be until you have coffee here. \u00a0  The best part: the owners! \u00a0Super friendly and knowledgeable about both wine and coffee. \u00a0The wine is stored at the proper temperature (unlike other wine bars within a quarter-mile radius--I'm not naming names, but you know who I mean), and the espresso is exactly perfect--if you've ever burned your lips on a Starbucks latte that's cooked to near-boiling, you will appreciate this alternative! And once they've met you, they'll greet you by name when you come in. \u00a0I mean, who does that? \u00a0And they like to talk to their patrons! \u00a0Lunch Geek (down the street on the opposite side, which they opened a few weeks ago) and Ma'velous are making the corner of Polk and Market seem like a neighborhood. And once Twitter moves in, this place will be even more famous.  They serve light food as well--exceptional cheese selection and delicious salume served with McEvoy Ranch olives (yum). This would be a great place to go for a bite and a drink before or after the Symphony or Opera.",

Though popularly known as a wine bar, I would highly recommend coming for coffee. They have rotating coffees from all over the world. Some third wave coffees from across the country like Chicago's Intelligensia, Oregon's 49th Parallel and Oregon's Stumptown are hard to find a region where we take full pride in our own artisan coffee makers (here's to you blue bottle, four barrel, ritual, de la paz, verve, ecco). They make it 6 different ways: individual v60 dripper, chemex dripper, aeropress, french press, espresso machine, siphon. Most of these methods you can easily do at home.  The downside is that there is no wi-fi and in a part of town that's not quite so pleasant, but I do think it's a great addition to this part of Market Streeet.",

The stretch of Market where it's located needs some more businesses just like this to help bring it back.   My bf and I went in one quiet Tues evening for a glass of wine before getting dinner somewhere else. Since it operates mostly as a coffee bar (and it was a little early), we ordered wine at the counter like we would coffee, which felt a little strange here, even though I do the same thing at other places in the city. Maybe it's some operating kinks still being worked out.   The wines were really good though. I can't remember exactly what we had, but they were reasonably priced per glass. I'll be back soon to try the cheese and cracker plates too, and maybe coffee if I go earlier.",

He just carries fresh beans from several of the best roasters around, and because he truly loves coffee, he's invested in great equipment and prepares those coffees as well or better than the roasters themselves. Case in point, Phillip prepared for me a better espresso shot of Stumptown Hairbender than they served me in one of their Seattle cafes. But here you also get to taste Stumptown blends and single origins back-to-back with Ecco, Intelligentsia, 49th Parallel and sometimes Tim Wendelboe. Some other paradoxes: this cafe is very pretty but it's modest in size in a so-so part of Market Street near the civic center. Phillip is modest, friendly, approachable, and one of the best baristas around. Located near MUNI and a couple blocks from BART. Oh, and it's a wine bar too. Probably equally as good as his coffee bar.",
