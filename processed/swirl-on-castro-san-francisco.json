Not only was the bartender extremely down-to-earth (very important qualification in the hyped and rarefied wine critic world,) but their flight selection was clearly varied and interesting. Yes, the Shiraz labeled \"Layer Cake\" was a monstrously chocolatey mix of gob-smacking Aussieness, but hey, excess is not a mark of poor taste. It was a good match with the slightly more austere Nero d'Avola and Corbieres that ran alongside it in the flight.  The one other patron there was also fairly knowledgeable, so I take it that this is a place that is good enough to attract an discerning audience.  If there's any fault, it could be that they close too early (8pm) and have far too few wines (I would estimate the shelf space held a total of fifty wines in the 20-50 dollar range.  I will definitely be writing more. Watch this space!",

    "review_text": "My new favorite place in the Castro is this lovely little wine shop and bar. The bar is really small, there's four or five stools along the serving area and two small tables in the back. But there's a lovely little garden out back with lots more room for wine-loving Castroites, their cute little doggies and their lush gal pals visiting for the weekend.  We did a flight of reds for $11.50 and I would have taken home a bottle of each if I hadn't just bought a case of wine the day before. The wine cabinet in the corner of my living room has expanded to a set of boxes piled in the corner. The madness must stop somewhere. But, anyway, back to the review. If you have some time to ponder your selection, why not take a seat and try some out? In addition to flights, they'll serve tastes and glasses, poured with a heavy hand, God bless them.   Three favorite things about Swirl:  1) Really nice staff, not pretentious at all. As much or as little attention as you want.  2) I really liked the way the shop is organized. As you walk in, bubbly is the first thing on your right, and across from that is the booze. Wine occupies the whole right side of the shop. Most wine shops organize by origin or varietal, but Swirl is organized more by your personal taste in wine. One section is called something like \"robust reds.\" There's also a small section simply labeled \"Splurge.\"   3) I don't know a lot about wine, I couldn't articulate a good description of what I'm drinking or explain why certain grapes do well in certain regions. However, I really know how to drink the stuff. I mean, I have that part DOWN. I didn't recognize many of the wines here and that's pretty unusual for me. I really like that you could wander into Swirl and have a pleasant natter with the staff and go home with some fun new find.   If I'm spending the weekend in the Castro, wine is probably the only tasty thing I'll be taking home with me, at least if I pick it up at Swirl I know I'll end up satisfied. Wow, when did I become a dirty old woman?",

Here are some examples: after work mani-pedis always turn into out-til-2 drinking binges, complete with dancing on bars, coyote-ugly style. On weeknights. A couple of hours at a karaoke bar turns into an afterparty at a stranger's house til 5 a.m. On a weeknight. A \"quiet\", quaint Sunday brunch turns into a morning hike up and down Castro, solely for the purpose of drinking. And drinking more.   This time I have a lot to thank my persuasive friends for. Swirl ended up being the best bad decision I've made! Sure I needed to get work done. Damn right I needed to clean my house. Most certainly I should have been at the gym. But instead my ass was comfortably cupped in a stool at a darling mosaic mini bar at the back of this well-stocked and well appointed shop/wine bar. The owner is amazing (though the other guy working there was questionable or maybe just having a bad day) and the \u00a0tasting menu is pretty expansive, considering the size of the tasting area and the fact that the focus really seems to be on retail, space-wise, anyway. I'm a huge fan of the current white flight but I hear the red is good too and you can pick and choose from the tasting list to put your own flight together. Or just drink a glass. Or four. Or five.

Oops! \u00a0But as Timmyloo was tipping back an amazing Zin with a lovely drunken drag queen, he invited me to stay and sip with them. \u00a0He's a wonderful conversationalist and every time I visit him he teaches me more about wine without coming across like a knowitall. \u00a0Beware! \u00a0Timmyloo will figure out your tastes and you will end up buying 4 bottles when you only came in for a glass! \u00a0Of course, onlyt after he has sipped a few glasses with you. \u00a0Salut to Timmyloo! \u00a0I only hope that your liver is as strong as your humor and grace.",

In fact, on one Thursday, one of the customers attending the wine tasting took me under his wing and talked me into trying a Spanish wine that turned out to be delightful.

I think that Swirl is a great place to stop by for a glass of wine before a meal (I'm sure that whatever they are pouring is better and more reasonably priced than your wine options at your average restaurant in the Castro). \u00a0Also, if you're like me and like to browse wines, then you might enjoy nursing a glass of wine while you peruse. I would not, however, recommend Swirl as a destination for a night out because the space is small and the atmosphere lacking (again, it's more of a store than a bar).",

My friends, Matt and Tommy both decided to get there over an hour late, so they were unable to enjoy Swirls, as it closes at 8:00. This is my one complaint, but I do understand that the employees want to have fun as well  Give this place a try, as it truly is a gem in the Castro District.",

My gf &amp; I had some time to kill before our massage appointment @Always Tan Skin &amp; Body. We saw the cute little wine bar/shop and decided to come in for a quick look see.  It's a cute &amp; cozy little spot located in the Castro, nestled between trendy restaurants, bars, &amp; other miscellaneous shops.  They have a nice assortment of whites, reds, dessert wines, sake, &amp; other spirits/liquor. They even served Absinthe- something I've never tried but always heard so much about. The nice fella behind the counter explained its acquired black licorice taste and 140 proof in alcohol content. Woah. That's pretty strong.  The back area holds a wine bar which offers tastings that average about $3 per taste. Nice.  Bottom line: Cute little wine bar/shop that has lots to offer, not to mention friendly &amp; personable staff.  Tip: Exclusive wine tastings go down every other Thursday.",

    "review_text": "Have I mentioned lately that I am a bad influence on my friends and I like to make them do things they don't want to do, know better than to do, and all out shouldn't be doing? I haven't? Here are some examples: after work pedicures always turn into out-til-2 drinking binges, complete with dancing on bars, coyote-ugly style. On weeknights. A couple of hours at a karaoke bar turns into an after party at a stranger's house til 5 a.m. On a weeknight. A \"quiet\", quaint Sunday brunch turns into a morning hike up and down Castro, solely for the purpose of drinking. And drinking more. Damn, I am good at making people bad.   This time, and the time before that, and the time before that, I have had a lot to thank my pushover friends for. Swirl consistently ends up being one of the best bad decisions I help them make! Sure they make excuses about how they need to get work done, clean their house, go to the gym. But instead I plant their asses comfortably in a stool at a darling mosaic mini bar at the back of this well-stocked and well appointed shop/wine bar. The owner is amazing, as are most of the employees, and the \u00a0tasting menu is pretty expansive, considering the size of the tasting area and the fact that the focus really seems to be on retail, space-wise, anyway.   I'm a huge fan of the current white flight but whatever they have on the menu is generally good, too, and you can pick and choose from the tasting list to put your own flight together. Or just drink a glass. Or four. Or five. Or \u00a0a half glass or a bottle or a Belgian beer or any combination that will keep your friends drinking instead of being productive members of society. Whatever you do, call me on your way. I'll meet you there, with my friends, who should likely be doing something else.",

Knowledgable staff will help you pick out exactly what you're looking for.  Price-wise it's competitive with the rest of the neighborhood.  But the back is where the party's at* because there are a few tables where you can buy a glass of wine and sit and chat with friends.

Patient staff, cozy backroom and it's perfectly fine to bring in some snacks (i.e., the requisite cheese and crackers) but I imagine they'd probably be a little upset if you brought in some Burger King.***  * - insert appropriate mullet joke here.  ** - but not too much of a ruckus as to make things too difficult for the people working there.  *** - no one would have a problem with Popeye's because, come on, Popeye's is awesome.",
