    "review_text": "Came here with 3 friends on a Saturday night. Loved the look of the place when I walked in. We hadn't eaten dinner, so we each ordered a \"sharing\" plate as our entree, as well as a few smaller dishes as appetizers. They were sold out of brussel sprouts.   GOOD 1) DECOR: Retro/hipster vibe.  BAD (everything else) 1) AMBIANCE: Terrible acoustics and an awkwardly large 4-person table made it impossible to hear the person sitting across the table.  2) PORTIONS: Besides the poutine and the mac n cheese, the plates were not actually sharable. My husband could have eaten both the lobster empanadas and the pork belly by himself, in 2 bites each. Instead, to make the food last longer, we cut it into a million pieces. Yes, we could have ordered more, but see the next bullet. \u00a0 \u00a0  3) PRICE: $18 for lobster empanadas, $16 for the pork belly, $12 for poutine (aka - fancy french fries). \u00a0  4) FOOD:  * Lobster Empanadas: No flavor. Or perhaps there wasn't enough empanada for me to taste the flavor. Who knows?  * Pork Belly: Fine, but nothing special.  * Poutine: The \"cheese curds\" were like chopped chunks of supermarket cheese, and not a particularly tasty one at that. \u00a0  5) SERVICE: Waitress took our food away without asking whether we were done. (I wasn't!)  Despite a hefty tab, we all left hungry, and I left vowing never to return.",

    "review_text": "I'm probably a lot luckier than premiere Cherylynn N., when it came to checking this place out. *cue Pharrell's Get Lucky song*  Sure the spot represents the swanky digs of the Hayes Valley community. Think Piedmont with a little more hipster thrown around I guess?  Anyway, the lady wanted some wine and it just so happens the Yelp app suggested this was the only place open on a Saturday at 4pm (most places opened around 5pm).  Sitting down at the Bar we meet Chase, the guy that probably keeps all the H.V. ladies on their toes. A very personable guy who's coasting through life as a bartender in the industry. When I asked fellow waitresses their impression of him, a blush or two seems to be the response.  He admitted right off the back recently they acquired some new wines and in order for him to get back to his rhythm, he needed to sample a few before pouring our orders.  Our initial pours of wine were of the following: (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FhE3Op4Hh_7%2F&amp;s=2995daf884dff116e554330fc7610d321f63a8285a6acd430cacc12976174649\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/p/hE3Op4Hh\u2026</a>) Pinot Noir, Laurier Carneros 2009 and Chardonnay, Jeriko Estate, Russian River  Personally, I found the Pinot to be a bit too mellow for me. Whereas the Chardonnay had some nice buttery notes which would have complimented the Lobster Empanadas I hope to try in the near future. One by one, he kept uncorking and tasting some of the stuff. During his personal tasting, he allowed Jasmine and I to sample some of the Mediterranean stuff and get our personal view of things.  After those samples we wanted some munchies so we also ended up ordering some Brisket Poutine: (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FhFA-sjnhwj%2F&amp;s=d2c905743f313902fba860fe52b00a8bf6aef62f8e6b1f00dab1a5ce506cff83\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/p/hFA-sjnh\u2026</a>)  Now it's a bit unfair comparing this Brisket to my friend (and fellow Yelper) Dru C., who makes a real serious Brisket. The dish as a whole was nice, I get the purpose of the Petaluma cheese curds, hints of garlic, the fries and the gravy kind of all layer on top of one another without stealing the spotlight for too long. My only qualm with the dish is the gravy sort of gave the brisket a backseat.   When I think of well done brisket, I believe you should taste the moistness of the BBQ within the inner layers of the meat while enjoying a refined touch of smokiness. I also believe this dish could also be elevated if there were an addition of burnt ends (I know its more of a Kansas thing).   Anyway Chase and the rest of the crew made us feel apart of the Hayes neighborhood even though we were a bridge away. I look forward to going back and exploring more of the savory treats and wine in the future. Four stars for an initial rating, cheers!",

I live in the neighborhood and I travel globally the service here ranks in the bottom 10% of the world including some 3rd world countries.  Don't let the decor fool you. Just because it looks cool shouldn't obligate you to bear with the low quality service.  I ordered sliders. I bought the beer from the bar. They said they would deliver it to the table. Essentially 6 feet away. I patiently and politely waited for half an hour. Nothing happened. I asked the two waitresses if I woukd get anything served soon. They ignored me. Then I asked again seriously I ordered food .. sliders.. is it coming? The waitress said you already ate it and you are asking for more? Your flickering eyes see not telling me the truth. And left. \u00a0Yeah I realized from a recent interview I was flickering my eyes too much but not much I can do about the fact that I spend too much time in front of the computer to earn a living. I realized she didnt symphatize with my foodlessness I approached the bartender woman again asking where my food is. She said it was delivered but that she can order it again if I want.... I said considering I never got it it would be inappropriate to say \"again\". she said to come back in 5 minutes to the bar.I waited 15 minutes went back nothing was there. She was totally annoyed that I came back. I said is it coming? She said in a few minutes. Gave them another 10 minutes went back again.. nothing. In the meantime their low class waitresses were serving some other people's dishes and when I looked their way wondering if that was my food, they reprimanded me saying not to touch that since it wasn't my food as if I was gonna steal the shitty food on the plate when I was just wondering where this oh-so-wonderful food was that I had been waiting for 1 hour.  I went back to the bar she got even more pissed dove into the kitchen and came out with two shitty looking biscuits on a plate. Tripped a bit. I said can I please have some water with that. She unwillingly went to the faucet grabbing a wine glass (they don't knkw how to serve water) and she filled it up with some shit colored tap water with no ice and handed the wine glass to me. I told her this is not potable water and refused the glass.  Went to the table to try the delicacy. Some clown showed up alerted about the situation. Asking if all was ok. Obviously it wasnt. I took a bite of the horrendous piece of shit slider and tried to eat a bit more. It was so spicy snd bad. It's the kind of food thst gives you heartburn afterwards. Unflavorful and overly spicy. I was so hungry I teied to finish 1 and left the second one. The owner came and asked if all was good I told him he should consult his staff. He is arrogant and obviously doesnt come from the service industry. I told him he might as wel shut down the place right away since its so bad. He didn't even know how to apoligize.. he left.. and 20 minutes passed as if he had practiced in front of the mirror finally came back and apologized posthumously in a very insincere manner. I told him whatever and he disappeared and reappeared agaib at 10 to take away a friend's leftover beer blaming the city about the liquor license policies without eveb allowing him to finish his beer. We left to place pigalle to never go back to the shittiest service I have ever seen in my life.

Nothing like that, the bill came, all items on there, full price. That's not how you treat a sophisticated customer, but maybe that's not what they are looking for..?",

Stopped by Noir for an evening/late snack and some wine with a friend. \u00a0The place is beautiful, the chairs are comfortable, and it has an overall nice vibe. \u00a0But I didn't come to the place to soak in the atmosphere.  The service, like so many other people have mentioned was not on point, not even really close. \u00a0We received our snack order before we received our wine, even though we'd ordered our wine first.  We ordered the blue cheese bites, deviled eggs, beet salad, and the johnny cakes. \u00a0(Okay, so a big snack.) \u00a0Blue cheese bites were underwhelming, the deviled eggs were good because of the siracha in them, beet salad was okay and the johnny cakes were tasteless and we didn't even finish them.  At 9:30pm we were asked if we'd like more wine, which yes we did. \u00a0After a long while we received our wine, and our check and were informed that we needed to be done and out of the restaurant by 10pm.  So after shot-gunning our wine we left.",

    "review_text": "UH-AMAZING Concept.  UH-AMAZING Ambiance.  UN-AMAZING Service.  Working nearby, I was excited to learn that a new wine bar would be opening in Hayes Valley at the old Fritz location. Uniquely San Francisco, Noir Lounge is an ultra-sexy wine bar with a 1940s vintage theme, sultry reds and golds, and plushy sofas and chairs. A total HOT DATE spot. What makes this an amazing lounge is its film noir theme. There's a huge ceiling to floor projection TV in the den area (there's also multiple flat screens around the lounge) that is set to play black and white movies. I adored the awesome shadow box of two silhouetted figures from The Big Combo (1955): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F16syBHo&amp;s=ab97a054051dad95c20cd6b6c270789535f7c7402f625d7e36e360f4ace55618\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/16syBHo</a>. If Foreign Cinema had a lounge this would be it. \u00a0  After dinner last night, I decided to drag the bf to Noir Lounge for a night cap (soft opened on 3/29). We arrived at 6:45 pm (yes, we eat like old farts) and was easily able to find a table in the back area. There's a front bar area with lounge chairs and a communal table, a back bar area with more sit-down tables, and then the den area which houses the whole projection screen TV (come early and snag seats here!).   The cute menu was presented as a play bill: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F16z9Afy&amp;s=94a137e4413b1c9dc006d539f3aab1f1e4639ff2ed14ad57b1b370cf459fb46d\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/16z9Afy</a> and featured about 10 wine by the glasses at $8-$14/glass and several pages of wines by the bottle at $31-$68/bottle. They also have a good selection of beers for $5-$7/glass.   While I understand that it's a wine bar and not everyone is a lush like me, it would be nice to see non-alcoholic drink(s) on the menu (every wine bar that I've been to does). There's a lot of people who can't drink wine or beer because of religious reasons, health reasons and/or maybe they're in AA. They may just be out to mingle and socialize with their friends so non-alcoholic option(s) should be available to them other than tap water.  Noir currently has a bar bite/snack menu from pop-up chef of Sweet Jo's Chili &amp; Biscuits with very enticing items like Smoked Gouda Tater Tots ($6), Ham &amp; Biscuit Sliders w/ Pulled Pork ($8) and Rock Shrimp Johnnycakes ($12). The menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FYykAIj&amp;s=0af52b82b5160e46e8b04f53e392e64f419415e17b0cb1852314c37c36975479\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/YykAIj</a>.  Now onto the UN-AMAZING part of the review...  While they're still in a soft opening mode and still trying to figure things out, there were A LOT of major service issues that I couldn't overlook. I was teetering back and forth of whether to write this review but I think it would be beneficial to the owner(s) so they can iron our these major kinks before their grand opening.  (1) My drink took an excessively long time to arrive. We sat there as four of the surrounding tables received their drinks before us. Mind you, they arrived and ordered AFTER we had. It took 25 minutes to get my glass of wine: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FXSf57R&amp;s=2b9267d64920ae7bc5c8f90e784cccd9c26e5fd47346e2bef8e0367761184208\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/XSf57R</a>.  **Note about the wine markup, my glass of wine was $14/glass but online, a bottle retails for $16.99!?!?! That's cray!  (2) The staff was confused, overwhelmed and clearly lacked training.  **While I was ordering a glass of the blend, I asked the waitress what was the correct pronunciation was to which she replied, \"I have no idea.\" I don't expect the staff to remember the menu like the back of their hand but they should have some basic understanding of it. If they don't know, a more appropriate answer would be: \"You know what, I'm not 100% sure but let me find out for you.\"  **We watched as wrong food orders were brought out to tables who never ordered to food to begin with. Even the chef came out and asked the back bar area if anyone had ordered sliders because they had been sitting in the kitchen for 15 minutes. Bless her heart but publicly announcing this in front of customers was unnecessary as it drew more attention to their service issues.  (3) The owner seemed like a really nice guy as he checked in with some tables several times but never checked in once with others. It's good business practice to be consistent especially IF you want return customers so he should of checked in with all customers and not just selective ones. We were not one of the selected tables.  (4) Even though we had just eaten dinner, I was adamant about ordering one thing off the food menu. It's a good thing we decided to eat dinner beforehand because our Smoked Gouda Tater Tots never came; rather it got mistakenly sent to the table in back of us. Our waitress saw this, apologized, and said that our order would be coming. Another 20 minutes passed and we never received it so I asked that she cancel our order. Sorry, we don't have all night to wait.  (5) When it came time to pay for our bill, we paid cash and never received our change. When my bf flagged down our waitress to ask for his change, he received our bill (again) but no change.  I absolutely love the venue so I'm hoping they work out these kinks out because I do wish them success.   Until then, come with a lot of patience and don't forget to nosh on the complimentary popcorn from the vintage popcorn maker. \u00a0  \u00c0 la prochaine, Noir Lounge...",

Vs. fig and thistle another wine bar in the area definitely more Intimate and romantic for a date with a lot more seating and food options from apps to small dinner plates.",

As long as I'm in good company and have some food or drink (and it's tasty), then I'm a happy camper. But Noir Lounge really did us a doozy last night.  We came in and tried to order a glass of wine at the bar. It took awhile for me to catch the attention of the lady behind the bar, and when I finally did, she told us to sit down and a server would come to us. Okay fine, but it then took around 10 minutes for someone to show up. We ordered our glasses of wine and proceeded to wait about 30 minutes! How long does it take to pour some wine? It wasn't like they were meticulously mixing a fancy cocktail or something.  The original server who took our order never reappeared, but at one point another guy came by our table and hovered to the side - I wasn't sure if he was a server or not. My friend assumed he was (correctly) and told him we'd already put in an order, but could he bring us some water. The water never arrived, and neither did the wine. So at the end of 30 minutes, I stood up and caught the eye of the lady behind the bar. As soon as she saw me looking, she realized we didn't have our drinks, and went and poured them. Okay, fine. She then handed them to the guest at the bar she'd been flirting with for the last half hour (rather than pouring our drinks) and asked him to hand them over to us at our table. Really? I prefer not to have some random guy handling my glass of wine before it's delivered to me, and in addition to that, he started flirting with her about handing the glass of wine over, so that he didn't actually turn around and give it to us until after a long, weird and awkward delay.  We drank our wine and while my friend liked her glass of Barbera okay, mine was just \"meh\" (some weird varietal from Italy I hadn't heard of before but wanted to give a try). I can't really blame Noir for the fact I didn't love the wine though. The same male server came back to our table and asked if we wanted another round. We said yes, and that we'd also appreciate some water. We both ordered the Barbera this time. He came back and told us they were out of it, but maybe we'd like the Grenache (since it was also a Spanish wine). We said okay. He then came back and told us they were also out of the Grenache. Really? He was the one who recommended it! Finally we picked a wine they actually still had, a California Cab (which was actually pretty good) and enjoyed our second round. Thank god my friend is good company!  We gave them a 10% tip which was more than they deserved but I've never given less. Oh well. Based on the good reviews for this place, maybe they were just having an off night. Regardless, I don't think I'll be coming back to Noir Lounge and if I'm in the area, will just hit up Two Sisters next door instead.",

But the movie was silent because they were playing music.   This is a great date place or to catch up with a group of friends. My girlfriend &amp; I just had light dinner @ Domo and I wanted her to check out the place before my date arrived. Thought for sure he would be running late since it was raining last night...

Hope I didn't butcher our Irish sommelier's name... He was phenomenal. I enjoyed each &amp; every wine glass he suggested. My date ordered the meatballs &amp; flank steak.....

We had a great waitress and they play classic films in the background!! We both ordered the Prosecco and relaxed in the big red booths they have all around. Its so nice to have a few options in Hayes Valley now. Around 7:30pm it was packed so I suggested you get there early and don't leave your seat. I hear the food is great and the fries on the table next to us looked delish! If you don't find anything on the menu you like they have a self serve popcorn machine.",

Two things to consider if you are thinking of this place: - It's really loud, we had to almost shout to carry a conversation. - If you are sitting in the back, you get almost no cell reception. \u00a0For me, this is usually a plus since I don't like phone conversations with dinner, but we were waiting for a couple of people who were running late, so we had to run outside a couple of times to get updates on their progress.  Really good selection of wines and beers, and at a fairly decent price. \u00a0The food menu was somewhat limited, so good for drinks and nibbles, but not a lot of choices if you want a full dinner.  We had the following: - Biscuits - good flaky biscuits with honey butter. - Tater tots - not your typical Orida tots. \u00a0The texture was a lot smoother (like mash potatoes) with a cheese in the middle. \u00a0Definitely very good. - Blue cheese sandwich bites - the blue cheese overpowers anything else, you can barely taste the grilled bread. \u00a0Not \u00a0that this is a bad thing, a definite plus if you like blue cheese. - Swedish meatballs with egg noodles - this was good, but I think it pales when compared to everything else that we had. \u00a0After having everything else, especially the blue cheese grilled cheese, the flavors on this dish just didn't stand out.   Service was pretty good. \u00a0Yes, sometimes we had to wait a little but they were really packed. \u00a0My one complaint is that based on their website, I thought that they would have more options for big plates/dinner. \u00a0I think only one of the large plates listed on their website was on the menu. \u00a0Yes, they had other large plates on the menu, but I am sorry, chili is not a dinner option for me.",

I'd love to have an intimate birthday party on the back room.   The wine and service were excellent. Both of our servers read the vibe that we wanted good wine and snacks but mostly wanted to catch up, so they gave us quick, spot-on recommendations and checked on us just the right amount (well you could say I was over served b/c I had a 1.5-day hangover).

    "review_text": "We've been looking forward to Noir opening in Hayes since Frijtz announced the closure and the Noir concept first started circulating on Grub Street. We lived two blocks away and were excited another cute wine bar would be opening. Due to the usual delays of inspections in the city of San Francisco we moved out to the East Bay. But we visited recently and had a mixed visit.  For starters: The interior is, dare I say, perfect. Absolutely beautiful and I love the flood of... well... noir. It feels like I'm stepping into an old movie. The lighting is so wonderfully textured and dramatic I'm just ready to sit down and enjoy our visit. The wines are good and the drink service is on top of their game. This is a great place for a drink and some small bites with friends. The biscuits were great, I only wish for more.  But... Our table ordered a pork entree that wasn't to our liking. It seemed to be more of a salad with a few potatoes tucked in and some pork with it. We didn't feel it lived up two the expectation of what a place like this would offer. A manager came to our table and graciously took it off of our bill and offered us something else.  One of my friends at the table asked for hot water for tea (since Noir didn't have tea at that time, our server offered to bring the hot water). They brought us a cup of hot water and a slice of lemon. So we made our own tea. No big deal. I don't hold that against them. My friend finished her tea and left the lemon untouched on her saucer. The cup was cleared and came back refilled with hot water! Nice. And two slices of lemon, debatably the first unused one and a fresh one. Not so nice. And the used tea bag. Awkward. I, not so graciously, point this out to our server. She takes care of it and returns later to check on us and is a little antagonistic about not \"knowing any better.\" That interaction really put me off.   All in all I think Noir is a beautiful location for a few small bites and wine with friends or a date. They should really focus on that.",

I always forget that they close early, since they're not a spirits bar (or maybe, because it's Hayes Valley). As a result, I've been conditioned to avoid this place when it's dark out. NG.  Personally, I prefer a more intimate wine and beer bar -- it gives me the chance to talk to the owner/bartenders on their stock and why. In here, I feel hip and isolated in a roomful of people.

The lighting is low and candlelit, which lends itself to making everyone look attractive. Even me. And I went dressed like Holly Hobby.   But before things get too sexy, there is a live pianist that bangs the bejesus out of them ivories. If you are sitting in the back, it's quite loud. If you don't like the company you're with, this is good times. Just nod and act like you can't hear. I quite liked the pianist's repertoire. He played Keane's \"Somewhere Only We Know,\" and Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun,\" among others. I got so excited when he played Soundgarden, I nearly fell out of my chair. That's just cool, you know?   I skipped the wine and got a beer-a Pilsner Urquell. My friend ordered a Scotch Ale from a Colorado brewery, which he didn't like. Score! I drank his too. I thought they had a nice beer list. I can't remember it very well now because of all that beer.   The food smelled so good and my stomach was eating itself, but I didn't stick around long, so I had to pass. Next time.   The parking around NL (Hayes Valley) will make you want to light yourself on fire. I parked in front of a church and defied them to have my vehicle towed.

While I've only lived in Hayes Valley for 3 years I'm very concerned about what new establishments are opening and what kind of impact they will have on the neighborhood.   Last night I visited Noir Lounge. I was very impressed with the overall look &amp; feel of the space. They completely transformed the old Frijtz location and it's a huge improvement. We sat in the back screening room and watched Vertigo on the big screen. The place was buzzing with patrons and the vibe was pleasant and relaxing.   Shortly after ordering a glass of wine (at 9:15 pm), we were greeted by the manager who very nicely informed us that they were closing at 10pm. We then learned that the neighborhood association when issuing their permit required them to close at 10pm daily. THIS IS ABSURD! Why would the neighborhood association do this? All of the other restaurants in Hayes Valley have licenses to stay open until after 11pm. The bars are licensed to stay open until 2am.   Noir Lounge is a nice addition to the neighborhood and I'm confident they will do well if the city will loosen restrictions to their operating hours. I'm not sure how a business can survive with such limitations and wish them great success.",

Honestly, I was just curious to see if this place is still beautiful at daytime. It is and some more...  The chicken &amp; waflles are amazing!!!! I even said theirs is better than FarmerBrown's! I feel like I betrayed a loyal friend just saying that!   My friend tried they mushroom omelette and it's yummy too! I like the rosted garlic on the omelette.   All in all, their b'fast menu is simple, unpretentious, short &amp; yummy. I will definitely go back &amp; try something else on the list.   Oh, the crew are as friendly as the people at night!

Ambiance: The restaurant offers an unique combination of wine lounge with a 1900's background theme. The restaurant has a cool projector in the back which shows classic cinemas. Additionally, there is a popcorn maker near the middle of the place where you can grab some while waiting for a table.  Food: There is a wide selection of food ranging from tater tots, smoked gouda cheese, to desserts such as bread budding. There is also a wide selection of wines around 50. The wines are great pairing with the food and definitely offers a different experience compared to other wine bars.  Service: The service at this establishment can definitely improve. We waited about 45 minutes to get a check, which I thought was quite long. The waiters seemed confused and disorganized and came by multiple times thinking they gave us our check. Besides the poor service, this is an interesting place to try out.  Overall: This place has a lot of potential to be a big hit in Hayes. Hope to come back again soon.",

There had been a few email misses that made it a bit difficult to get hold of each other on both ends, but they were gracious about everything. They also worked to resolve any anxiety I had in response to missed emails. We reserved the back area and it was the perfect space to host 30-40 people. The ambiance was great for connecting with people as the dim lights and vintage couch invite you to linger. The old movie playing in the back room added some fun for everyone, including the 2 sweet children who were a bit bored while surrounded by adults. I also have to say, for a wine bar - they give excellent service to children. They poured them root beers in \"fancy\" glasses and were very welcoming. Considering the neighborhood and how elegant the space was I was a bit nervous that they would be a bit snobby about kids, but everything about this place is inviting. I wasn't sure what to order for people to nibble on, and they were very helpful. They talked to me about the menu so I could plan appropriate bites for our guests that would be both elegant and filling.  Through the night the service was impeccable, and even as we lingered in the back room and the place started filling up, they didn't rush us. I hope to host an event here again soon.",

I'll break my own rule and talk briefly about service. \u00a0I went the past two Thursdays to Noir Lounge to meet friends in Hayes Valley for happy hour. \u00a0First Thursday, service was a little rough as was to be expected - I didn't have a problem with that. \u00a0Second Thursday - the service (with the same servers working) was vastly improved. \u00a0That's what you should hope for - to see improvement. \u00a0The second Thursday, they totally took care of us like I'd expect from a place that's in its prime. \u00a0I think the staff and management are well on their way to having this place running smoothly.  As for the material: food, drink, decor - they're great. \u00a0The place is very nicely done inside. \u00a0It's rare to totally overhaul a space as they did and have it feel comfortable. \u00a0These guys pulled it off. \u00a0The food so far has been excellent and should evolve - I read in the press release they lost their chef right before opening, so I bet this will only get better. \u00a0Drink menu - on both the wine and beer side - is well thought out with lots of options for different tastes.  I'm happy with pricing and also think the big screen is a plus for sports watching - will definitely catch a game here at some point. \u00a0I'll be coming back pretty regularly I think. \u00a0Definitely give this place a shot.",

    "review_text": "The wine and food at this place both amazing.   The service is bad bad bad. They are incredibly snobby.  My partner and I used to like coming here while we wait for our table at Domo because we like a good glass of wine, but everytime we struggle to get the attention of the waiters. Finally, when we ask for what we would like to drink or munch on, the drinks take a long time. Come on it's just a glass of wine, should take 15 minutes to come to the table. Then the struggle to pay is another challenge.   Last time we decided to wait and order at the bar rather than sitting at a table, when we walked in and stood in front of the bar the bar tender told us that we could sit down anywhere in the place and a server would come (all the stools at the bar where taken). We smiled and told him we would rather order at the bar. He completely ignored us. We stood there for 10 minutes, no service, no engagement, nothing.   We decided to walk out and go to Two Sisters instead where service is way better and less snobby.   Will we come back? My man and I probably no. My girlfriends and I probably, but very probably.",

    "review_text": "Noir Lounge is pretty good for what it is. They have a descent amount of wines available by the glass and a much larger selection available by the bottle. The beer list is not bad all things considered and the bar towards the back has rotating craft beers on tap.  The decor is dark and dimly lit and a bit on the fancier side, definitely not the scene for dive bar goers. The room in the back is pretty cool and has a large projection screen playing classic films which is a nice touch. The service when I came was acceptable but nothing to rate them well for.  The biggest downside here is the food, which was just bad. Their attempt of a modified \"grilled cheese\" was disgusting and was not grilled nor very cheesy. My wife and I played rock-paper-scissors and the loser had to finish off the sandwich as punishment (we don't waste food, even bad food). The meatballs were okay but a bit underwhelming and not worth the price. The only thing enjoyable to eat that we had were the potato tots, but they were also priced higher than they were worth.  Summary: Not a bad place to start off a night but that is it. Come here for a drink before heading somewhere else (some great restaurants in the area, and other watering holes have been popping up lately). Don't plan on staying long and definitely do not plan on eating here.",

Sounds like they just got a new chef who completely revamped the menu...not just small plates anymore. We had apps, salads, and entrees, all of which were delicious (Can't stop thinking about the poutine!). I see some past reviews had an issue with the food quality/portion size. If that's the case, go back, and try the new menu.",

    "review_text": "I was lucky enough to be invited to a media reception for Noir Lounge - the sexy, new wine bar in Hayes Valley.  I really dug the vibe in this place. It's both modern and retro. The interior reminded me a little bit of the old Ambassador on Geary (kind of retro-chic). They have two bars for your wine/beer needs; a long communal table, and a V.I.P. room where they play classic films like \"Maltese Falcon\" on the wall while you sip the night away.   As part of the media event, we were treated to some bubbly and bites. Chef Joanna Karlinsky (formerly of Meetinghouse, Elite Cafe, and Sweet Jo's Cafe) has created an eclectic menu of gourmet movie theater snacks and shared plates to pair with your vino (everything from Swedish meatballs, deviled eggs, to Joanna's famous Meetinghouse Biscuits). There were also some tempting desserts floating around the room, but we left before I could try them.  In any case, I was definitely impressed with Noir Lounge. It's a wonderful, sophisticated addition to Hayes Street. I'm looking forward to returning here soon (preferably with a date), a pin-striped suit, and my fedora hat.  Somewhere out there, Humphrey Bogart is smiling.",

The atmosphere they've created with the space has a unique feel to it. A film lounge? Sign me up! Our server, Olivia, was also very attentive and made the entire night an enjoyable experience.

    "review_text": "I feel shocked and saddened after reading a fellow Yelper's 1 star review. What makes me even more sad is that he appears to have been invited through friends of friend to the Happy Hour I helped organize at Noir Lounge last week (we go try new bars a couple of times a month).  Well let me tell you, Noir Lounge is AWESOME. Unlike this yelper who sounds like a whiny as$hole, I thought this place was great, along with the 20 or so other friends who joined us. Everyone seemed to highly enjoy the venue and the service was great.   I too, happen to travel all around the world and I can't even begin to understand this dude's comments about how this compares to the bottom 10% of the world. This dude is a wannabee critic and obviously knows nothing about anything he is talking about.   I ordered my drinks through the cocktail waitresses who were genuinely friendly (much more than what I am used to in the city's establishments) and delivered my drinks quickly. The manager and owner of the bar came to me multiple time to check how we were doing and seemed completely sincere.  They are really trying hard to make this place a great venue in Hayes Valley and I admire their effort.  As a new venue, there may be some small issues here and there at some points in time, but that should be expected from any new place (I personally didn't notice anything negative). Instead of smashing new business' reputation on Yelp and act likes entitled asses, people should \u00a0learn to support local businesses.   Noir Lounge, thank you for believing in Hayes Valley, you have our support!",

During my time here, they got a decent amount of tables at the same time and my experience did not waiver. I will definitely be returning and encouraging others to.",

The atmosphere's great- much bigger than it appears upon first glance, as it goes really far back in the building and has a lot of cool nooks. I particularly like the second bar area in the back. And the decor's great too.  The food was quite good, the chicken and waffles really stood out- juicy crispy fried chicken and fluffy waffles, paired with a duo of creamy gravy and a decadent maple sauce, and topped with candied pecans. Stellar. The poutine appetizer was also delicious.   So- overall a good place for a drink or snacks, just be prepared for the bill... Things add up quick!",
