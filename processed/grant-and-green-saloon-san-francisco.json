Had some pizza at Golden Boy, walked around with some buddies to hand out some handbills to promote the show in the neighborhood and eventually got back to the venue.   The music was supposed to start at 8 to 8:15 but the manager was telling them they couldn't start yet. It was 8:30 by the time I got there. They were supposed to wait for a hand wave or something from the guy in charge who was merrily playing beer pong and drinking.   At about 8:45, after having several people ask him when the band would start came over and said that the concert is definitely not happening and the shuffling iPod DJ would continue. Everyone who came out to see the band was sort of awe-struck.   How many times has anyone seen a band be able to fully set up, sound check and be totally ready to go, with 20some people there to see them - and more on the way...... and then be told they can't play because: it would disrupt the cliquey beer pong tournament that had a whole 10 or so people playing in it.  We decided the best thing toi do was to clear out and left the place almost completely empty in the bar area with that dozen of people hanging around the beer pong tables.  I know one friend was asking for her money back for her beer, I hope she got it. Sure, the band got paid their $50, but that's not worth the price of them and their fans that came out getting jerked around.  This was a fiasco in management at the Grant and Green. I'm avoiding that place like the plague - there's always Mojito next door, where they value live music.  If you're a beers-willing 35 year old frat boy wanna be who want to relive the beer pong days, yay, by all means, but i can't get over how badly this was all handled by this guy.   Maybe other days there are better... I just can't get over this.  Sorry about venting.  but... seriously?",

Why did you do that, evil wench? Because he has a real JOB (he's a doctor) that requires him to carry a work bag and he had just gotten off a flight from LA and came straight to the bar to see our friend's band play. With all the handsiness and douchebaggery going on in your bar on Friday, I find it appalling that you chose to single out my friend for having a LAPTOP bag with him. You claimed it \"wasn't working\" to have it in the bar because it was \"in your way\" and that's not all you said. \u00a0And nothing you said was said in a remotely polite manner. Well, thanks to you, we all left. About 20 of us. 20 nice people who also happen to be good tippers and who were simply there to support our friend's band. Nice job. I hope you don't treat everyone with an education and a strong work ethic like this. Oh, maybe you do. That would explain the majority of your patrons I observed on Friday night.",

They thought my best friend and I were on a date and while my friend was in the bathroom, the bartender said \"You deserve more than a cheap date...is he really only buying you $1 Pabst?\" Of course I explained that we were best friends and that we were broke and just wanted to grab a drink somewhere, so that was that.   The next time I came here, I had a COMPLETELY different experience. My friends and I were trying to figure out a place to go for NYE. Most of them were broke, so we settled on a place that would be free that night. We originally wanted to go to Maggie McGarry's next door, but they were charging a $20 cover, so we went to Grant and Green instead.  It was pretty crowded, which I expected, but it was so hard to get a drink. The DJ was good and played songs that everyone could dance to - and fist pump - but they didn't start a countdown when it was about to be midnight. That was pretty lame. After that the night pretty much went downhill, but none of that has anything to do with Grant and Green, so...  I think I'll stick to happy hour here and probably try it out on a weekend again, but never for NYE.",

Cons: -Stage: \u00a0it's tiny, and if you're anything more than a 3 piece, you better make sure everyone in the band loaded up on deodorant. \u00a0Consider backlining with other bands as much as possible, otherwise prepare to setup your gear FIFO, not LIFO (you know, because the stage isn't deep enough for more than just one band's stuff). \u00a0 -Sound: \u00a0No monitors (as of Oct 20, 2012), soundcheck, or sound guy. \u00a0Note to whoever in the band stands closest to stage right: \u00a0the mixer is in front of you so you'll likely be your band's sound guy. \u00a0Expect everything to sound like shit from the stage. \u00a0 -Parking: \u00a0is pretty much impossible on the street... a number of hourly/fixed rate lots are nearby if you're low on parking karma -Other stuff: \u00a0No separate access for loading in/out means you have to wade your way through the crowd to make it to the front door. \u00a0No green room (but you probably knew that if you're playing here).",

It was crowded as hell, but the bartenders were being quite efficient and we didn't have to wait as long as I expected for a drink. Probably because it's cash only and that's easy. They had a DJ going with decent music, and of course all the @#$%shows from St. Pattys celebrations. But it was rather inexpensive, the bouncer dude was plenty nice, and it wasn't as bad as I figured it would be despite the drab decor.",

So that is a lil nice treat for you ballers on a budget. lol Anyways I had a such BLAST here!!!! The bartender (Scott) was hilarious &amp;&amp; nice (just make sure u dont get him in any camera shots. He hates that crap). He served us until his shift was over &amp; still hung out for a lil while after at the bar with the customers!! I felt REALLY welcomed here. This place made my 1st trip to San Fran amazing &amp; intoxicating! If u are from out of town &amp;&amp; are looking for a dive bar &amp;&amp; a good time I recommend coming here!

They have a small standing area and a random, very conspicuous Deer Hunting video game that attention enthusiasts can use to get noticed since its right in the middle of the room in front of the bathroom entrances.

But alas, it was a lie - a cruel joke. They were OUT of PBR.  How DARE you cruelly crush my liquid dreams and force cheap vodka on me instead?! For this insult alone, Grant and Green fell from grace in the eyes of this dive-bar aficionado.   The place is a hole in every sense of the word. Surly bartenders, cash only, a loud loud loud live cover band and unbelievably inebriated patrons dropping bows and screaming gibberish.  The band wasn't bad - a shade better than mediocre. Some decent tunes filled the room, but the drunken band of idiots occupying half the establishment took away from some of the entertainment value. I'd forgotten, in a city where last call takes its final breath at 1:30am, the populous needs to get their drink on EARLY. So expect to find stumbling fools aplenty at 10pm.   I would potentially return, if only to see if they could fulfill their broken promise. And perhaps, with enough PBR in my little system, I'd be a better sport about the rabble-rousers, the weirdos and the stumbling half-wits that surrounded me.",

I never go here because it always looks like a mess from the outside. So when I arrive it was closing and they weren't letting anyone else in. We really just wanted to get our friends attention that we could see 10 feet from the door. One of the door guys closes the door (before 2am so the place is actually still open) in our faces as he leaves. I step aside so he can get by but insists on walking where I step which apparently sets this guy off. He starts on us like I'm trying to mess with him. Seriously? I'm half your size. I'm sober, and not trying to get into anything at 2am. My friend calls him rude and he gets all roid. We are totally civilized in calling him out on his behavior. He continues on with his \"stop talking that stupid shit, bro\" rant as we wait for our friends to come out. And at the same time the larger door guy starts shoving some guy who wanted to use the bathroom inside. He was telling him \u00a0not step to him and that's why he physically pushed him hack all the way to the corner. Really? He's 1/3 your width. Not called for. The skinny guy was not aggressive or rude. So physical force was ridiculous. \u00a0The roid dude finally disappears and our friends come out so we can finally leave. I'm not one to put anyone on blast on yelp, but that was so highschool and such an unprofessional display right in front of their storefront I needed to let the Yelp commnity know.  I'm embarrassed for Grant &amp; Green Saloon to have these two working their doors...",

However, this place is not dive-y enough to be a true dive, nor is there a shotglass of class (or @ss) in there. Let's be honest- a halfway dive is just a dump. That's what this place is.   The best thing about the place is that it can host live music on stage. That is certainly a perk.   I never understood the draw to the bar, however. It's not really a neighborhood hang out (and this neighborhood DRINKS!) . The location is great- perhaps, that's the draw.  Anyway, I think that the bald manager who thinks he's God's gift to revive cool needs to know that slinging crappy drinks and Pabst ain't original . I think you are better off going to a bar where there is some sort of personality.   On a good note, the bar is walking distance to some good food and bars and prices are reasonable.",

Friendly, accepting atmosphere, with cool bartenders. Cool \"dive bar\" feel without that \"get-me-out-of-this-sketchy-place\" aftertaste.  Cons: When there's dancing, there is NO ventilation, and this place gets brutally hot and sweaty. Seriously, it's like being in an uncomfortable, dark, drunken sauna.

    "review_text": "Let me preface this review by stating a disclaimer that not ALL of my reviews are going to contain a story wherein I am liquored up and ridiculous. That said, this one does.  My introduction to Grant and Green was during the North Beach Festival, where thousands of people (most of whom wish they were still in college) relish the opportunity to drink during the daytime and still adhere to socially acceptable standards. These people wake up thinking, \"Today, I am going to PUNISH my liver. And it is going to be the tits, because everyone else is a-floatin' in the same boat!\" Clearly, these are my brethren.   So I'm with my girls, and we're bar hopping, making our way over to the beer gardens, when we come upon this divey looking place with a sign that says, \"NORTH BEACH FESTIVAL SPECIAL: JACK DANIELS SHOTS\" and I'm like, \"Ladies... pit stop.\" I make quick friends with Ben the doorman, who's impressed with my ability to slam the whiskey like its the Sweet Nectar of Life and therefore does not charge me. We move onto the beer gardens, followed by the concert in the park (Unauthorized Rolling Stones- fucking UNREAL., fyi).  After the face-melting rock of the 'Stones cover band, I felt a twinge in my soul, like, something was amiss. The problem? The Jack Tingle (that's what I call my whisky buzz) was fading fast. So I confer with the gang, and it is decided that a return trip to Grant and Green is in order. Back we go, and before you know it I've regained my stride and power through the rest of the afternoon, befriending G&amp;G all-stars such as bartenders Zak and Blaze, and the neighborhood drunkard Perry (whom I had to inform that I was not, in fact, employed by Centerfolds, much to his dismay).  By the end of my evening, I had lost my (roommates) sweater, my sunglasses, and my ability to stand or reason. This place kicks ass.",

Plain Jane in the way of decor, pretty large quarters, friendly bartenders, lively patrons, and a band(they were setting up). The place has the makings of a good bar except for that god awful smell.   Hole number 5 seemed to be a bust, stupid sand traps!

I am then immediately informed that the show has been canceled due to the pressing need to host a beer pong competition.  It is within every right for the manger of the bar to cancel a show where at least 20 people showed up specificity for in sake of his friends getting together to throw sweaty balls into glasses of lukewarm beer.

This past Monday I was invited to go check out the jazz band that has been playing at G&amp;G for over a year. Big Michael leads the band and supports different musicians who come by and take turns. The small crowd consisted of other musicians and the few locals that know about this lovely opportunity to enjoy good live jazz played by people that are very passionate about their craft. I had such a great time with my super enthusiastic companion and the fun energy of the musicians that I am already looking forward to coming back for more jazz!",

He first dropped me off at Columbus Cafe...excellent, well done driver then after a drink or two I mosed up to this place. There was a chick on stage that looked just like Yoko Ono (Sp?) The crowd was really mellow and just enjoying the music. It was a Tuesday night (I was still unemployed) I was WASTED! Before I knew it, I had myself, my friend, and three random guys back at my house drinking beers and having a dance party till the wee hours... Needless to say, this bar pours a stiff drink, draws a fun crowd and makes me do stupid shit...I like it.",

Also, beer prices are pretty outrageous - think $5 for a bottle of Red Stripe or a pint of Fat Tire. No cover, though, and for a somewhat dive bar they have surprisingly good sound.",

However, if you looked up the word \"douchebag\" in the dictionary, you would see a picture of the bald bartender that works here.   Overcharged my friend about $15 for 3 drinks he ordered. Pretty much belittled another friend I was with. Had no respect for the girls in our party...I could go on. Be sure and check your tab if you order from this joker.   Gets 2 stars for the music.",

It was great to have too fun sublimish bands for free.   Funny enough, the north beach weekend was apparently still going on outside since a guy got knocked down in fight quicker than I'd ever seen in one of my cigarette breaks.",

Me and 8 other musicians played for nearly 5 hours, brought over twenty of our own friends into the place, got people dancing on the floor and the bartender gave us 100 to split 8 ways. \u00a0Plus we got ONE free drink each. \u00a0Don't hate the bands. \u00a0All in all a nice enough place. \u00a0Drinks are a little expensive for a weeknight. \u00a0The bartender was nice and attentive.  As a side note, you may want to bring brass knuckles or a switchblade to this place, my friend's face is broken because 7 muggers hit him out in the street in front of the building.",

Not to mention a beer tournament that the manager is actively participating in and dominating.  This bar is fun for a drunken night of debauchery with your underage and over-glamorized marina girlies but NOT fun if you want to get a cheap beer (really, a pint was $6!!) and listen to some groovy music played by your favorite local band.  I would STRONGLY recommend walking 4 businesses down on the same side of the street to MOJITO'S where the company is festive, the drinks will get you tipsy, the music is funky and there is no chance of the venue canceling on the band.
