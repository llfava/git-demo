Immediately I fell in love with the place because it's so cute! And they have this great open/lofty feel. And ingenius seats that fold out of the wall if you need more seating.  I just had cider - and off-the-menu chicken nuggets/boneless wings that were pretty darn good. There was a live band, and the place just had a great vibe.   I will definitely be going back.",

The owner girl was super nice, the other bartender was not as friendly but he was efficient enough.   They are sort of a cross between a coffee shop and a lounge. \u00a0I think they have a beer and wine license because they alcoholic beverages seemed to be more wine, sake and beer related. \u00a0  The lounge is off Geary across the street from the backside of the Japan Center. I didn't even realize it was there until I saw it on yelp. If you are looking for a cool little spot to grab a drink and you are in the J-town area, this place won't disappoint.",

We were there on a Thursday night and there was only one bartender. She was, to be honest, pretty incompetent. She messed up our order, poured wine all down the stem of the wine glass and never wiped it off, and then the biggest offense came at the end of our stay when we closed out our tab and she gave us someone else's credit card! Apparently she had already closed out someone else's tab with my fiance's credit card, they left with it, and then we were given that person's card. Needless to say the person who was given our credit card bought themselves dinner at State Bird Provision and we had to deal with the credit card company and cancel our card the next day.

What \u00a0I liked most about this place was if you wanted private time, there is plenty of space for it but the people of this place made you feel really welcomed.

But if you're looking for somewhere trendy, clean, friendly, with a touch of relaxation, Social Study in the Fillmore is for you!  Taking the disguise of a caf\u00e9, the place serves up some of the yummiest cocktails and wine-tails. The place is complete with an actual espresso machine and WiFi, so it actually is a caf\u00e9. And the bites they serve can compete with any restaurant appetizer (the pork sliders were yummy). On the brick wall, movies are playing, not so much for viewing pleasure, but a nice trendy touch. And the icing on the cake, is the music flowing in the air. In my one visit, I heard Janet Jackson, the Fugees, Montel Jordan and Koffee Brown. You'd think it was my personal playlist on there.

They've also added a happy hour and the tacos and sliders are bomb dot com!  Now that I've tried several things off the menu, I feel safe in writing a review. I live just on the next block, and I definitely agree that I'm glad I don't have to leave my hood if I just want a beer or a coffee and a low-key, but comfortable hang out. Believe me, that wasn't true when I first moved to the hood in '04.  Harmony makes a great latte (not a huge Four Barrel fan, but she does right by it), and I could drink a tennis bracelet's worth of Yellow Diamonds - a sparkling winetail. If it's got bubbles, I'll drink it. I like to stop by after farmer's market on Saturdays which is perfect if I can't decide on coffee or alcohol or both. I like the oldies R&amp;B on the turntable perfect for chillaxin' and dreaming up what I'm going to cook with my farmers' market veggies. They've usually got some nice pastries, too.  I dropped by after 4p the other day to check out their cheese n charcuterie boards. For some reason, I assumed it was a sandwich, but close enough. I chose Fiscalini Cheddar (try Fiscalini Gold - great local cheese) for my Branch and Board plate. One of the meats (which I've forgotten already) would be great for a picnic if you're a bacon fan - smoky with paprika. I liked the vibe at this time.  I do like the ambiance - exposed brick, dark wood bar, timeworn books atop the shelves, and a rich looking upholstered blue wall with jumpseats at two-tops.  Hmm ... and I was just wishing for a place where I could read a book and have a beer or maybe play a card game with a friend where my choices aren't limited to coffee and tea.  I'll be looking forward to a few more menu items and a happy hour. I've got to try the sangria, and it's good to know I won't have to get behind the wheel to get home.",

Very attractive space, friendly owner, great coffee. I was there between 11 am and 1 pm. Several parking spaces were available nearby. This is on the south side of Geary just east of Fillmore.  The big wooden tables will seat six, but at first I had a table to myself to spread out my paperwork. The owner offered and brought me a glass of water without my asking, which was very nice. The wifi is free (the owner will give you the key), and it worked well.  The downsides are minor: Outlets are scarce because of the brick walls. Some conduit along the floor could take care of that. There were outlets at the bar, at the table nearest the bar, and at tables near the window. \u00a0As pretty as the inside is, the view outside is of a a wall of the Geary underpass.  I would have spent more money if they served lunch, but the kitchen doesn't open until 4. I'd have liked to try one of their beers, but didn't feel at ease doing that in the middle of the day without something substantial to eat with it, so I contented myself with a very good brownie and a very good cup of coffee. \u00a0A cold sandwich, a salad, or a slice of quiche would have been a nice simple lunch option.   I'm glad I visited The Social Study and would visit again when I'm back in the area.",

It just so happened that someone we were with pointed out the bar as we were walking around looking for a bar. I really don't know how she spotted it as it 's not on Fillmore st and not so visible from the corner. We walked over to \"check it out \" and low &amp; behold we were completely drawn in by the decor and feel of the place. They even had a DJ that was playing R&amp;B hip hop, which added to the chill vibe we liked. It wasn't crowded but I can see this place becoming a new happening spot in the Fillmore/Japan Town. Only thing is that the place closes at 12am, however they let us finish our drinks without rushing us out while they cleaned up the bar (for that they get an extra star!). It's true they only serve beer &amp; wine but they do a creative job with their mixed drinks. Try the nojito &amp; the yellow diamond, you'll be very impressed. BUT stay away from the michelada - it's nothing like the real thing. It tasted like a bad bloody Mary with beer. A real Mexican michelada has lots of lime/lemon \u00a0with tomato juice &amp; this didn't compare. Sorry.   Anyhow, if you're looking for a hip wine bar (not your avg wine bar) with a cool hip vibe where you can have great conversation over good music, this is the place. It fits perfectly in the Fillmore &amp; I'll definitely go back before or after a movie!",

Thankfully, all three of us got what we wanted (err, almost... my friend who wanted coffee succumbed to peer pressure and got a libation as well).   Anyway, The Social Study is a fun place -- namely because the bartenders were friendly, the cocktails were amazing, the music was a mixture of R&amp;B (!!)/pop/old school, and they were playing the \"Golden Girls\" on the projector facing a brick wall. This is definitely a locals' spot; most folks looked like regulars or neighborhood residents. There was a mix in terms of age range... some were in their early 20s, some in their mid-40s. There are three doubles in the back near the bar - the tables have foldable cushiony chairs (hard to explain... you'll have to see it for yourself). There are long communal tables that seat plenty of folks. The night we went in, there was a semi-private birthday party happening so it was extra boisterous... May I remind you this was like... a Tuesday.   I'd definitely return. Some places make a great first impression, and The Social Study did just that.",

They have my favorite wine, Sexual Chocolate, by the glass, and really good food. My friend and I split the cheese plate, the salad and the veggie sandwich. All were excellent and moderately priced. This is a great place to just catch up with a friend in a classy and fun environment - I will definitely be back again and again.",

While I'm bummed they don't have a full bar, they do get remarkably creative with what they have: beyond the beer and wine lists, they offer beertails, winetails, and \"karatetails\" (soju mixed drinks). I tried the Yellow Diamond (lillet blanc, prosecco, and mandarin peel) which was refreshing without being overly sweet. A little pricey at $9, considering it isn't as strong as either a glass of wine or a regular cocktail, but fine for a one-time try.  I also wish the kitchen stayed open even an hour later. I stopped by after a Kabuki movie where I'd skipped dinner, and missed the kitchen closing at 9:30. Some of the menu items didn't even need any preparing, so even if they had a reduced late-night menu that'd be a great next step.",

When we were having trouble locating it, one of the girls totally asked a stranger, who ended up walking us the rest of the short distance there.

It was the perfect end to a perfect day. Our walk back to Hotel Kabuki after the bar was short and pleasant.  The following morning, a couple of girls walked back over here for juice and said it was just as nice and tranquil in the morning as it had been the night before.

We did have a bartender come around and get us a refill, but that was a nice to have and I don't think the usual.

They have a pretty nice list of wines by the glass and they also do wine cocktails. That's what I went for and I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered a Nojito which was white wine, soda, lime and mint. So basically a mojito but with wine instead of rum. It was really delicious! For the second round I got a Agavarita which was like a mango margarita but with agave wine instead of tequila. Again, really good. My friend had a few glasses of red and enjoyed them. They also have a beer list but we didn't get to that.  The space itself is cute. They have some nice longer tables so you can fit a group of 4 or even 5.

However, like a lot of new coffee bars, the place is trying \u00a0to be condiment hip. \u00a0Stevia is NOT a good sugar substitute - not sweet and leaves a metallic aftertaste. \u00a0Why not blue or pink packets? \u00a0Where is whole milk, or even 1/2 &amp; 1/2? \u00a0Soy milk and lo-fat milk only. \u00a0Let me decide for myself what I like in my coffee. And the coffee is expensive: \u00a0$2.50 for a small. \u00a0It is not THAT good. \u00a0The entire package for a coffee drinker is not appealing. \u00a0 The atmosphere/environment is nice. \u00a0Especially if one is not drinking coffee \u00a0ha ha. \u00a0Better for the wine/beer crowd later. Windows were dirty (noticeable since the entire front is window - which is nice) and many cob webs above. \u00a0 I'll go back one more time in a few weeks. \u00a0I think this place might make it with the wine/beer. \u00a0But it is not a coffee destination, and to attract morning coffee drinkers, it needs to be a destination since it is out of the way. I hope they make it.",

My only gripe is that their kitchen doesn't open until 4pm, so if you're having a long work day your only food options are pastries and baked goodies.

It looks like a study of a rich person's home. Lol. On Saturday night, there was a DJ playing some good 90's jams. The FEELS!

Keeps the place NOT RATCHET. Kinda nice actually.  Came in around 9 and most of the big tables were taken.. I could see this place getting crowded later on in the night but overall I think it's a nice spot to kick it. Only gripe is that there's only 1 unisex bathroom for the place!

The staff is efficient yet courteous. A great spot if you are in the neighborhood.",

    "review_text": "I hate to give a new establishment a so-so review, but my first visit to the Social Study was a bit less than stellar.   A girl friend and I came in at around 8:45pm on a Saturday night. We were the only two patrons in the establishment as we came in just as a couple others were leaving. No one greeted us, so we decided to seat ourselves. A quick look around and we saw some wall-seats (two-tops with small tables jutting out of the right-hand wall; seats without backs), and some bigger tables for groups on the left side of the room. Since no one else was there we opted to sit at a bigger table. We sat for a few minutes but no one came around despite seeing the bartender at the bar, so we grabbed some menus from another table. After perusing the menu and making our choices over the next several minutes and still nobody came around, I got up and placed our orders at the bar. Strange that despite being the only two in the whole place, and especially for a new establishment, the bartender and other staff made no effort to greet us or offer us any tips/pointers about the menu.  We each had a glass of SANFRANGRIA ($7) and we shared the BRANCH &amp; BOARD CHEESE PLATE ($9). The sangria was solid - I liked that they included fruit in our glasses and that the apples and pears were not so wine-soaked that they were inedible. It was nice to munch on a few cubes of fruit along with our cheese plate.  The cheese plate was fine - it included a blue cheese w/ honey, a gruyere, and a cheddar, with a small cluster of grapes and a couple of small slices of bread. The blue cheese paired very well with the honey. Unfortunately, the bread was fairly stale, and there were not nearly enough slices of bread for the amount of cheese on the plate - there were only 6 pieces of 1.5\" rounds of bread. Eventually I was smearing blue cheese onto the slices of gruyere and cheddar as we ran out of bread. The cheese plate would be much improved if they included either more bread, or opted to offer some crackers instead.   Note about the ambience: The room was quaintly decorated and was sufficiently dim for a low-key feel. The music could use some help - it was way too loud and I couldn't discern any theme to their mix. At one point they were playing oldies, which then turned into pop and even some EDM. Hmm...  Over the course of the hour and a half we spent there, the bartender only came by to bring us our sangria and cheese but she never came by again to ask how we were doing. A man, who appeared perhaps to be the owner, came by once to ask us how we were enjoying our drinks and cheese. At one point, a large group of people came in and congregated near the bar area. They appeared to be the bartender's/owner's friends, and the staff dedicated all their attention to this group of people while ignoring the two of us. Eventually when we wanted to pay and leave, we took out our cash and had it laying on the table for quite some time. Clearly no one was paying attention to us, so I got up and handed cash to the bartender, who took the money without asking if we wanted any change. We had included enough in the amount of cash to account for tip, but it was a bit rude of her to not even look at the amount and ask if we needed change.   Overall, the prices were fair and the ambience was fine save for the music being too loud. They've got a great concept going on and a solid menu and drink list as far as I can tell. If The Social Study could fix the bread-to-cheese ratio and seriously improve their customer service, I could see myself coming back.",

Entering in, the place was somewhat busy (roughly about 15 people) but a good quiet crowd, we walked up to the bar.   At the bar..  Waiting... Waiting... Waiting... \u00a0(5 Minutes Later) Looking around for a menu, I asked the bartender, the same chick again from my previous experience months prior (see previous entry) puts a finger in the air to say I'll be right with you in a minute.  (Um, ok, did she really just raise her finger to say one minute.) So once again, I looked around to see if I can grab a menu, then I asked her, \"may I get a menu,\" to no avail she ignored me and went on catering to the people around me.  I don't know what this chick's problem is.  Observing her work as we WAITED to place our order for drinks, I can see that she's the only one working, well missy, it's time to hire someone else to help you.  What makes you think you can do it all?  15 minutes later, still waiting for a menu, I've decided to just go with whatever they had that was a house white wine. I politlely said, can I get a glass of..  IMMEDIATELY SHE CUTS ME OFF AND SAYS.. One more minute, then she goes to open up a bottle of wine. After that she hands over the Ipad to the other patrons, sitting next to me, looks at me then focuses on another person who walks by and TOOK the order of wine for their table.  WHAT THE F*CK!  At this moment, I'm like hold up, this B!TCH sure didn't give me the time of day and she's going to order from him?   This place has so much potential! I know she's the owner and all but damn, you are a F*cking Rude C-yoU-Next-Tuesday.  RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE  DEFINITELY will never go back.

    "review_text": "In my more youthful days this place might have had a lot more appeal to me as a place to hang out with friends, enjoy a few drinks and catch up in loud conversation, but some of us change as we grow older and this place was simply a convenient place for our group to step into and unwind for a bit.  My friends and I had just completed a long volunteer shift doing kitchen prep work then serving as waitstaff for a fundraiser benefiting the nearby Creative Arts Charter School. \u00a0There were just a handful of us so we ended up working our collective butts off first preparing and assembling appetizer and dessert plates then walking around the venue serving dozens upon dozens of rounds of appetizers to paying guests. \u00a0The event staff kept us well hydrated, and the awesome chefs from Charles Phan's Slanted Door kept us well fed and even packed up some huge plates of leftover delicacies for all of us to take home.  All that work left us drained though and we really needed a place to just sit down, chill and reboot for the evening. \u00a0Social Study was just around the corner. \u00a0We looked inside and saw there was an empty communal table that could fit all of us so we decided to give them some business for the night.  The place is darkly lit mostly from dim overhead lighting very high above on their acoustically enhanced ceiling and by bowls of flickering candlelight on the table tops. \u00a0The Social Study theme is well represented with books (many were law reference books of the kind that nobody actually reads) stacked and lined across one wall atop comfortable looking individual booths.  Their menu is quite varied featuring small bites, many wines, draft and bottled beers and hot coffee drinks served in round bowl-like mugs. \u00a0You order at the bar, get your drinks and return to your table. \u00a0The bar staff was working in slow motion though and as more people walked in the line just grew longer and longer. \u00a0I guess having a varied drink menu doesn't always work in their favor. \u00a0We heard one of the ladies behind the bar apologize a few times for the long wait. \u00a0It all worked out and we all got our drinks eventually.  The tall wooden chairs weren't super comfortable but it was a seat and all of us really just wanted to sit down. \u00a0We toasted the night knowing that all of us worked really well together and we had just rocked a successful fundraiser for an awesome school. \u00a0My bottled beer was ice cold, and we were getting the rest we wanted so badly.  As the place became more crowded we found ourselves having to speak louder and louder just to hear each other. \u00a0They had loud hip-hop (Jay-Z, Beastie Boys, etc...) music blaring in the front of the house and they were projecting the movie \"Sin City\" high above the brick wall. \u00a0I enjoyed the random scenes of ultra violence on the big screen, but the combination of loud music, loud conversation and other people crowded behind our chairs grew tiring very quickly. \u00a0We finished our drinks and collectively agreed to get out of there.  For just a moment this was a great place to chill. \u00a0Thanks Social Study for presenting to us that moment!",

On nights the DJ isn't spinning from the balcony above, 90s Hip-Hop is played in the background along with movies from that era.   Social Study is perfect for a chill happy hour, pre/post dinner drinks, and/or post-movie drinks because it's just one block away from Sundance Kubuki. Is it a good place to study at? Ummm, after several glasses of wine, the only thing you'll be \"studying\" is the cutie you're eye-goggling from across the room.

We couldn't get any ramen and what better way to drown our sorrows than with some beer, wine, and soju cocktails?   I got THE CRANE and thought it was super refreshing, especially after fighting my way through hordes of people in the Peace Plaza. I couldn't taste the soju but definitely felt it soon (although that might be due to lack of eating -- curse you long lines at Ramen Festival!). I loved the light citrusy taste paired with the subtle heat of the ginger syrup. My friends enjoyed the sangria and hard apple cider. For a quick bite, I recommend the POTATO BRUSCHETTA -- the potato paste and spicy tomatoes over toasted bread was delicious.   Upon walking through the door of The Social Study I immediately fell in love with the decor. Books lined the shelves along the wall and multiple board games were sitting in shelves around the room. I can definitely see how they incorporated the \"study lounge\" feel into this bar.  Unfortunately the place was a bit more cozy than I expected and my party of 8 had a hard time squeezing in. I think coming back with a group of 6 people or less would be ideal. We managed to snag a table to hang out for an hour or so before our dinner reservations later.   I would definitely come here again for a nice hangout spot in Japantown. Hopefully we can play some games next time.",

The Starbucks on Fillmore just hasn't been cutting it recently. Loud, closes early, and awfully exposed to outside distractions. Walk a little bit south on FIllmore though and take a left at Geary, and you're in a completely different world!   First off, I'm a huge fan of dim-lights when I do work and when I do drank. And sometimes even when I do eats. So I knew when I set foot in The Social Study that I would enjoy my time there. The very very first thing I noted beyond the dim lighting was the general atmosphere about the place. Macbooks scattered about with their lights glowing bright in the low light, coffee cups and wine glasses at everybody's side, and the occasional group of friends/couples engaged in conversation. There was a DJ booth one floor above, although it was empty when I was there (9 pm on a Sunday night) and a movie being projected onto a wall with hip hop playing in the background. FANTASTIC. I don't fancy myself a hipster, but I do enjoy it when a cafe gives off a hipster vibe and this place fit the bill. Even had a book shelf with books on the side.   I'm not a huge coffee drinker (especially at 9 pm) and it was a bit late for grub so I just ordered up myself some tea and got to work by joining the ranks of customers with their Macbooks out. Got some productive work done and left after last call. I'm definitely coming back here for my studying/productive needs, and most likely coming here for my eating and drinking needs too.",

Could it have a few more outlets, sure. But I just bring a splitter and extension cord and I'm fine. It's a very unique place and definitely worth at least checking out the next time you're in the Fillmore.",

Trim excess head-fat/douchebaggery due to Cellar and the Marina wannabes from next door to Sugar Cafe.  - Add one tbsp of Bourbon and Branch. The drinks at Sugar Cafe are not interesting nor have they changed in years. Social Study has a much more unique drink menu - lots of chocolate based ones, which as the rare straight male chocoholic is appreciated.  - When marinating, move away rest of Fillmore which is turning into a baby Marina. I think teacup Chihuahuas outnumber people at this point.  - Serve hot. They don't have air conditioning, and just my luck I came here the hottest Saturday in the last decade.",

Plus, the owner has come up with fancy wine and beer-tails that are refreshing and unique! Oh, and there are great nibbles and snacks available, like their new charcuterie sandwich with fatted calf salami!!! AMAZE-balls!   While the food and drinks are great, the ambiance is the best feature. The 90's R&amp;B and old school jazz music set the mood (live dj friday and saturday nights!), and a cool, exposed brick wall anchors the atmosphere as professional and hip all at the same time.   Lastly, the owner and staff are amazingly nice, helpful, fast, and fun to talk to. They know their regulars and take care of them. I cannot be more happy with this place. A true neighborhood gem that fits in to (and dare I say, defines) Fillmore street's evolving character.",

I felt like I should whisper cuz someone might be studying for a final or something.   \u00a0 \u00a0Besides that and the fact that the are too dim to read the menu, this place gets my stamp of approval. Out of the dozens of bars I've been to in the city, this is probably the best place to take a load off and relax with a nice brew or glass of wine after a long day at work or school. I'll definitely be coming back.   Oh and the bartender is super attentive and easy going, I think his name is Roger or something. I know it starts with an R...I think.

It had a hipster vibe to it, yet they were playing old school R&amp;B and The Big Lebowski was being projected on one of their concrete walls. Interesting mix, but I was digging it.   They offer a large selection of wines and wine cocktails, as well as a small menu (imagine cheese and charcuterie plates). I do wish they offered liquor, but without a license, they make up for it with the rest of their drink menu.   Note - not too big of a place...so you might have an issue with a large group, unless you're willing to just stand around. But if you can snag a table or bar stool...you'll stay all night.

The Social Study is right up my alley -- they carry a wide array of different wines from all over the globe, feature piquant small bites like artisan cheese and charcuterie boards, and the space has a hip, minimalist vibe that'll make you feel right at home the moment you boot, scoot, and boogie through their front doors along Geary. It's still in its infancy being open only a handful of days at this stage in the game, but as they find their sea legs and carve a niche into a part of town lacking similar haunts, I can see this being the type of place I dip into before any show at the Fillmore or an evening romp at the Kabuki.

The DJ was mixing up all kinds of nostalgic beats - 90's hip hop, 80's mash, he was definitely serving up a hot plate of the meow mix special.   The snacks were delicious - we ordered the Board Meating with two kinds of salamis, prosciutto, crackers, sour dough sliced rolls with some chili dipping sauce; The Marinated Olives - were solid and a generous serving; The Cheese Plate with an array of complimentary cheeses that paired nicely with the wines.   The Sangria is on point. I was dangerously downing these tasty beverages and nibbling on the pieces of fresh fruit... yes I said FRESH. My gf got the Nojito - an exotic approach to a classic drink. My other friends ordered sangria's, Malbec's, and of course we had our beer drinkers.   Service was friendly and prompt considering how packed the place was and how large our group was (15 heads)   If you dig the Lounge vibe then you will love the Social Study.",

Its almost scary to write a review about it because it feels like such an unknown secret but really people should know about this place cause they deserve all the business.   Located just a couple blocks from the shopping and restaurants of upper Fillmore and far enough from the sketchy parts of the Fillmore its is the perfect location for grabbing drinks on a date or after work. There are never a ton of people here which is really great. If don't want it to feel like work to go to a bar then this is your place. It is a very small location with minimal seating at the bar or otherwise. You are welcome to stand make your own seating. There are games as well for those wanting some board game action. There are also books everywhere. I forget the story but they are incredibly random and fun to thumb through. There is an attic above the bar area where a DJ plays tunes on random nights and during the weekend.   Sometimes there are random movies and old tv shows being displayed on the wall. I never know what its going to be so I can't tell you what to expect. I saw scooby doo once but then I love lucy another time so yea who knows.  The music deserves its own five stars. Whether its a dj or a set playlist in the background you will hear some of your favorite 90's R&amp;b or even classic blues and soul like Otis Redding or Sam Cooke. The best playlist in the city hands down.   Its very dark in the place which adds to its chill vibe plus wifi makes it a great place to get work done or drink with someone special. The bartenders are excellent and their drink menu is incredibly fun. There are mixed drinks that are very rare and exclusive to the social study. You owe it to yourself to try them.   Its usually really quiet and intimate here which makes it perfect for meeting people or dates. Candles flickering dark atmosphere and being surrounded by couples feels good.   Whether you are looking to kill sometime before heading into Fat Angel or seeing a band at the Fillmore this place is the best reason to come into this area. Fillmore has always been a favorite place of mine and the social study defines what makes going out in San Francisco special. Will forever be a loyal customer to this establishment.",

The vibe to the place was really nice, yet busy. I loved the d\u00e9cor, very hipster. The place is a wine and beer place only, which I happened to really like. I ordered a delicious Amber Ale for only $5, which is a great price for a drink in SF. Tables are difficult to snag, you have to be pretty lucky. I am also glad there was a restroom here, which is located in the back. I would definitely come back to this place!",

The Social Study is a small place with beautiful exposed brick, great school/study decor, excellent R&amp;B Jams circa 90's and early 2000's, sweet bartender and great wine. I would definitely go back again for more great ambiance and chilling.  Only bad thing is even w/the WIFI, our phones did not work so well on Shazam (we were trying to tag all the old school jams). Even w/1 phone ATT &amp; the other Verizon w/4G, didn't matter. Oh well, that just told us, \"Get off your phone and ENJOY!\"  Please stop by if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed. :)",

The Social Study reminds you of all the great little spaces in the East Village that make downtown Manhattan so unique. Whether you are going to catch up with a friend, meeting for a first date or just looking to get out on your own- The Social Study caters to anyone looking for a relaxed and enjoyable afternoon or evening. Fabulous service, delicious food, good live music and there's always a classic movie playing on the brick wall.

It was captivating: bricks lining one wall, books lining the other; a cool menu that included slightly overpriced ginger ale; old-school rap and Michael Jackson mixed with jazz; really cool semi-young people hanging out and tapping away on their laptops.  It really is an experience that is not to be missed. Try it once and see for yourself.",

Low key, inviting and genuine are words that come to mind. If you're looking for a pretentious place this ain't it. It's physically perched a little past the corner of Geary and Fillmore. This places it on the \"other side of Fillmore\" and reminds me of H St and the early days of the U St corridor back in Washington DC. But hey, the less DBs and carbon copy clones around the better. There are plenty of neighborhoods where they already frequent. I had a cappuccino the day I was there. It was well executed. The coffee had a kick but not the dreaded over-roasted/some would say burned aftertaste. There are also \u00a0small plates for you to play around with if you are so inclined and your stomach just won't stop gurgling.  Great addition to the neighborhood.

Random books all over the walls (though, I guess I wouldn't have those med and bio books in my home), rap/hip-hop/R&amp;B with more of the 90's bent, coffee, liquor, and a projector playing Finding Nemo. On repeat. Pretty damn awesome already.  Staff here were friendly, but don't come out to the tables to get your order. So...order at the bar. And if you're feeling like a lot of liquor or coffee, sit at the bar.   There's just a few things that make it less of a 5 for me. The ceiling foam that looks like it's going to fall on my head at any time...is a bit scary. And the lack of waiter service. I guess its not too bad to walk up to the bar, but the bar also isn't set up for walk-ups...so I have to lean over people to get an order.",
