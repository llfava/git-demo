This one is just for the ladies. A man walks into a brain store to buy a brain. There are two brains in jars on the shelf. The brain on the left is half the price of the brain on the right. The man asks why. The store clerk replies \"Because its been used.\" Ba-bum-ching!  &amp;  2) A Jazz/Blues band at night with an Australian student, a French teacher from France and a ridiculous aspiring political consultant from Arizona.   All pours were *generous* pours, maybe not the delicate kind of mixology you would get in NY but Sweet \u00a0Jesus was there vodka in there.   This bar will always hold a special place in my heart. I searched for 'dive bar' on yelp and the best kind of 'dive bar' Yelp and San Francisco did provide. Your beer options will be limited. PBR will be the only thing on tap and cash only.

Take her across the street to Firenze by Night (where he is conveniently friends with the owners) for dinner, and then take her to The Saloon for some blues music, where he can show off his fabulous dancing skills. Hey, I can't knock his method. It worked on me!  Anyway, I love The Saloon for numerous reasons. The bartenders are totally crabby, but once you're in, you're in. They bring in the most awesome blues bands, and everybody, I mean EVERYBODY, will want to get down and boogie.   Whenever I feel like dancing the blues away, literally, I'll come to The Saloon.

Her friend plays the bass in this band and they were performing because of the Blue Bear event. Of course I yelped the Saloon before heading out and read the reviews of it being the oldest bar and smelling like a urinal, but we forged ahead in support of the Newts.   All I can say is that the decor is very interesting. The woodwork was clearly from a bygone era. The bar mantle was dark, appearing smoke stained. Then you notice the faux Christmas tree changing colors from blue to red to pink. And then you see it...a little statue of Amida Buddha above the stage.   There and then you know you're in another world. You're not in San Francisco 2007. You're not even in San Francisco 1950. You're just in another world.   The staff appeared to be rejects from a biker gang complete with long hair, long ZZ-Top beards of grey, and an intoxicated swagger. Johnny Nitro from the Blue Bear School of Music also fit right in.   There was an eclectic mix of patrons that ensured you were either in another world or on acid. There were young hotties hipsters that looked barely old enough to drink. There was a late 20's preppy crowd. There was the hippie looking guy with lace up moccasin boots that didn't match the rest of his apparel. There was a gaggle of older gentlemen who appeared to be there by themselves in their late 40's. And then there were the 70+ crowd that could only have been from the neighborhood. There was a lady who pushed her way past the crowd with her 4'-0\" structure but built like a sherman tank. (Literally) She looked old enough to have opened the bar. And lastly there was the guy in his 50's who stumble out of a cab, mug still full of beer, who could barely talk much less stumble in to the bar. I later saw him hitting on two of the vocalist from the Eye Of Newt. He took the rejection well.   The shots that we got were disappointing. Watching the bartender mix them, he looked like he was still tweaking. He told the drunken one that our friend, \"has great bar tits\" (whatever that means.) Yeah whatever dude. tittays or no tittays, It still took you 10 minutes to get our THREE beers. She might have shown them to you had you got our beers right away.   I know it is supposed to be a dive-bar but it's more like a sunk-durring-the-spanish-inquisition-by-a-cannon-\u00adball-and-featured-in-the-pirates-of-the-caribbean bar.  If nothing else I can say I drank once at the oldest bar in SF. If that's not enough I can say I drank in the oldest bar in SF and there were Christmas lights, a faux Christmas tree, and a buddha.   4 stars for being smart enough to have Blue Bear and the Eye of Newt perform.",

A bunch of locals, music lovers, and dive bar aficionados are the primary clientele here (although our hero hears this bar makes it into some travel guides to attract brave tourists too). \u00a0There's definitely a very aged and classic feel to this place and the bar has probably been stained with more alcohol over the past 150+ years than our hero has had in his lifetime. \u00a0The locals will pipe in with some stories as well if you ask them.  Even our hero's straight laced friend who'd never been to a dive bar before loved the bar. \u00a0Finding broken glass lying around the place on a Sunday morning from what must have been a wild Saturday night beforehand only added to the divey charm of this fine establishment.

I've only been here once to judge but it only had one bartender. Plus, there is a designated area to order your drink. Oh, and you can only pay in cash. No music this day I was here, either.   The bathrooms are ancient and confusing. Kinda threw me off.   I just don't want to go to a bar with so many rules to follow. I'm trying to have a good time and not have to worry. Too many other cool places in North Beach to spend too much time here. It's conveniently located on a corner near Columbus but just keep it moving, trust me!",

What I think is really great about the place is that it's an honest to goodness bar that has live music nightly and does not pretend to be anything but a simple bar with good, live music.

I didn't get eaten by wolves, or take a bite of that delicious red apple. i made it as far up to the bar and that's when i saw my sister holding up a scarf to her face. yep she was gagging and so was the girl who came in after us. now me, i was taking it in like most do dive bars, but the sister and friend wanted out. pronto. and out we went.   dark bar. yes. cheap drinks. i'm sure. good music? i imagine so. but man, this place smells like straight up funk. piss, sweat, tears and blood collected throughout the years. my sister and friend will never come back here. as for me, maybe. i think after a certain amount of time you kinda get used to the smell. i wouldn't dare use the restroom though. maybe i'll come back when i am pretty drunk already and the smell doesn't bother me a whole lot. \u00a0it is a neat looking bar. i just wish it didn't smell THIS bad.",

I figured I'd make this my last stop on my bar crawl but the experience was too bad I needed to get that awful taste out of my mouth. (That awful taste was a warm Budweiser)   I got here at 1 o'clock, band was playing, good number of people and seemed like a good vibe.   I approached the bar to order drinks. The lady behind the bar wasn't the kindest of people. I ordered some beers and she informed me they didn't have anymore of what I wanted. I then asked what they did have. She gives me this death look and then makes a gesture that I should look around. Seeing how I did that and that the tap I wanted was kicked, I wanted to know what else I had before I asked again. After discussing it with my friend, I ordered some Stellas. She then informed me that had no more Stella. Typical. Then I asked again, what they did have? She tried mumbling something. I told her to just let me get some Budweisers. She poured our drinks and made some comment that I should smile more. I smile, plenty lady.  Right after getting our drinks the band wraps up. That's cool. Then the lights come on. That's fine. It's still 1:20. Then this guy comes. The old guy who is cleaning up the bar is just harassing people. And what may not have been but felt like it, especially me. Listen dude, it's 1:20. If I want, I can guzzle four beers in forty minutes. Don't rush me for my one beer. It's still early. This guy was relentless. Trying to talk to my friends was impossible, with how often he would come over. It wasn't even 1:30 and this dude is up our behinds.   In the end, we finished our beers in no time and left. Hope harassing us to make sure you left maybe 5 minutes earlier was worth losing business.   Never come here.",

The Saloon is a staple in SF, the oldest bar around, and worth going just for its history, but its more than that. They also legitimately host some of the best live Blues music you'll find in the Bay. And its all free.  Yeah, you're not gonna be treated like you're a unique and valued customer. And no, you're not gonna love going to the bathroom. But you know what you're signing up for. And thats a no-nonsense, authentic fun time at a kickin bar thats about havin a good time and couldn't care less about what you think of it.",

It's not uncommon to see people there dressed to the nines, shaking and shimmying alongside strippers on their off time, and leather dressed bikers all squeezed in tight together in front of the postage stamp sized bandstand. The place offers some amazing musical talent for a nominal door charge. On any weekend night you can see Barry \"The Fish Melton, Nick Gravenites, Ron Hacker, Tony Perez, and Tommy Castro playing this hallowed blues joint. The place reeks of old school San Francisco and the fantastic musicians who used to play at The Saloon regularly. such as the late John Cipollina from Quicksilver Messenger Service and Johnny Nitro who passed away recently in his apt just above the joint. Nitro was a fixture there every weekend for over 20 years. Say what you want about the place but it's REAL. and it just doesn't get any better on a weekend night in North Beach.",

There is not a big beer selection, I think Bud Light is on tap and then you can get Heineken in bottles and about six other beers in bottles.

Paint is peeling off the walls and the pastoral paintings are so blackened by smoke (when you used to be able to smoke in bars) that you wouldn't even know they were there unless pointed out to you by the bartender, who somehow looks 40 and 90 at the same time. \u00a0That being said, it hosts great blues acts and there is never a cover. \u00a0I would give it five stars because it's everything a dive bar is supposed to be; however, as I was sitting at the bar talking to a friend about how great the place was, a cockroach scurried across the bar in front of me, onto my bar napkin, tried to climb up my beer bottle, got bored, and then visited my friend's beer. \u00a0This was right after I ate some salami offered to me by the bartender.

This place is one of the most real, classic, and groovy \"character\" spots in the city. \u00a0It is simply this: \u00a0a blues bar. \u00a0The guy playing was just incredible, the place was smelly, the bathroom was TRIPPY and awkward for such a tall gent as me, and you can't even get to it with a dancefloor of tired, lost drunken tourists, marina boys far from home, an errant hipster or goth waiting to meet a friend, and then a whole mess of grizzled pirates that look like a cross between leather and a horse, and that is both men and women. \u00a0The barker himself with his derby, cigar, and vaudevillian charm was enough to coax me in.  The barkeep that serviced us is why this place gets five stars. \u00a0This Iggy Pop look alike was grinding out his ass on the line, vacuous to guest requests just listening to the blues and R&amp;B echoing from the hollow body Gibson. \u00a0His robotic, autopilot arms seemed to be fierce and fragile trembling twigs that were in a frenzy to keep pace with his body that was detached from his meager, kind yet distant smile. \u00a0  So I order a jack and coke with a beer. \u00a0Beer check. \u00a0Not paying attention to what he is doing.. check.  Then, the most amazing thing happens. \u00a0He is watching the band, while reaching behind him for the jack. \u00a0He is bobbing along in another world as he grabs the Cuervo. \u00a0Anyone who has worked a bar know that a bottle of Jack and a bottle of Cuervo don't look the same, but for all intensive purposes they are similar. \u00a0Not like Galliano and Jaeger sitting next to one another.  Whatever the case, without skipping a 1/4 second beat, his rote, automatist hand expresses the realization that he is into the wrong bottle, switches without a pause, flips it lazily, calmly, and without any Cocktail shenanigan flourish... pours my beverage.  This all happened in less than a second. \u00a0But a seasoned barkeep can make a mistake... but to make it, realize it, and solve it in less than a second WITHOUT PAYING EVEN A MODICUM OF ATTENTION....  ...that barkeep is your friend. \u00a0  Incredible place, some of the best blues I have ever heard, let alone in this city. \u00a0  Yay!",

Now dont get me wrong, it smells like the oldest bar in SF; but the drinks were stiff and cheap, the bartender was a friggen joy, and the band was GREAT! If you're not from around here and visiting this lovely city, do yourself a favor and swing by The Saloon...It wont be anywhere near the most posh, trendy, or expensive place you'll spend your time at while youre here...but it'll make sure you leave your heart in San Francisco.",

The only reason they're earning two stars is that you can enjoy some pretty decent live music and I'm all for supporting a local place that gives musicians a place to thrive.  Cash only. One drink minimum PER person. As soon as we walked into this bar, my friends and I received attitude from the female bartender. Why not card everyone in our party instead of singling out certain people? Every drink I asked for they didn't have and then she responded with, \"Can't you see we don't carry that in our bar?\" \u00a0Um, it's your job to know what you put in the drinks not mine last time I checked. Lose the attitude, lady because you'll end up losing customers and possibly your job. It's not like I asked for anything that they don't carry at most bars.  She took awhile to take my friend's drink orders too. I get that you're busy and you're the only one working at the bar but the attitude won't earn you a good tip. They only were getting beers which apparently were posted on a sign because when they asked what was on tap she just pointed to the sign hanging pretty high up on the wall BEHIND the bar. That's a great place to put it considering we were facing the bar in the opposite direction. Thanks for being SO helpful. (I'm being sarcastic can't you tell?)  Since I obviously couldn't sit there without ordering a drink (I actually read the signs unlike some people). I walked out of the bar annoyed by the 'tude. You're not getting my hard earned money with an attitude like that.  I know why you enforce the one drink rule because you don't want people going and loitering in the bar to hear live music and this is the \"dive bar\" mentality at some places but in order to earn respect you have to give it and I didn't get any from the staff at this bar. I like most dive bars and I don't mind a little dirt and some character but this was by far one of the worst experiences I've had at a bar in SF.  It's too bad because this bar, unlike a lot of bars in the city seemed to attract a much more diverse crowd than other bars in SF and the prices seemed reasonable.  I'd only go back to listen to music and if they actually stocked something I could drink. Sorry, if my tolerance to alcohol doesn't live up to your standards but in order to survive, you're going to have to adapt to your customers' needs until then I won't be patronizing this bar or telling my friends to go here either.

My friend's and I were wondering around this area looking for a good place to drink, and there it was. I immediately recognized the bass lines to Albert King's Born Under A Bad Sign, and I knew it was the right place.  The rest is history. Eugene Higgins and his band were playing there, and MAN they rocked!!  This blues bar ain't pretty looking, but it sure gives a nice saloonish environment that I sure dig. The music is awesome, and the crowd was really cool too.  The only issue I had was that they didn't have beer on tap... I had a couple of bottle beers, but once they have tap, it's an easy 5 star from me!!",

It was great and their set ranged covers of Elvis' \"Little Sister\" to \"Miserlou\" to The Ramones \"I Wanna Be Sedated\", rockabillified.  Also, I got to watch the bouncers toss some asshole who was harassing the bartender out on the street. (I had to call the cops for the guy's own protection because he wouldn't go away and I was afraid they'd beat him senseless). I don' t know about you, but for me this constitutes a fun night. An aside--not be a \"hater,\" but I'm kind of not into the current rockabilly fad: These guys transcend all that BS with full-out, authentic dive bar rockin'",

My first reaction was that she was an employee and there was no photography allowed so she was regulated. I was pulling out my wallet to donate to the band which never happened because of this incident. Retrospectively though, I think she was just really drunk and because I wasn't doing white-girl dancing, she didn't want me to be in front. Too bad--the band would've came up a few dollars. Sadly, this represents my experience of The Saloon, one of the oldest bars in SF. Because of this terrible person, I had a bad time here. I still got a couple good photos of this awesome band.

But it metamorphosed into the \"Swig Lounge...\"   The term \"old school,\" really does apply in the case of The Saloon. This is reportedly the oldest bar in town. Those drunks of years past had to be careful walking out of the place in the post Civil War years, to avoid being shanghaied on some random ocean voyage.   The bar sits on Grant near Columbus. When you walk inside you'll see why it is still simply called, \"The Saloon..\" \u00a0The place has remained the same for years, with a long bar, old wooden planks for a floor, and the same bearded door man..  The Saloon's building somehow survived the 1906 earthquake, and has held onto it's authenticity despite the ever changing landscape surrounding it. I can think of no better place in San Francisco to enjoy a stiff drink while listening to live blues.  Tommy Castro used to play here along with some others. \u00a0Johnny Nitro jammed here on Friday and Sunday nights. The man was a local legend on guitar. Somehow when I am drinking a jack and coke here, I feel no guilt, no pain, only good spirits of past and present. \u00a0  Sadly I just heard some tragic news regarding my favorite resident bluesman at the Saloon....

We had a party of 12-15 so it was a bit difficult to get everyone into a bar/club that wasn't going to charge us $15-20 per person to get in. Definitely not a typical bar I would go to. But, did I sure have a blast.   I go up to the bar &amp; order a VO &amp; 7 and a Vodka soda. The bartender told me the total which was $7.50. I asked him again...yup $7.50!! I couldn't believe it. I told all of our friends and we all decided to stay there &amp; drink up! The drinks were unbelievably strong....just how I like it!   I had to only give 4 stars because it was very hot in the bar and there were some sweaty elderly people. But for cheap drinks, free cover, and a live band I couldn't really complain. Ended up having a great night!",

Case in point; The Saloon. \u00a0If you have never been here and saw my 5 stars you would wonder what the hell was I smokin/drinkin. \u00a0Well that is none of your business!  I have a history of loving dive bars, just all the character/characters of most of them, and like The Saloon, many have oodles of historical significance. \u00a0The legend states that this bar survived the fires caused \u00a0by the 1906 earthquake because there was a brothel upstairs and the firefighters didn't want to lose such an important, ahem, business. \u00a0It is also the longest continuously running bar in the city. \u00a0See its a historical landmark, how much more credibility does one need?  Ok, and now on to my last visit on Sunday 11/15/09, arriving around 6:00 for some live blues. \u00a0Again, love dive bars but on this occasion I have the lady friend in tow. \u00a0I did give her a little bit of a heads up on what to expect as she is a polite, sophisticated lady in her 50's, but didn't want to scare her off either. \u00a0I remember playing up the historical thang to peak her interest.  This particular visit did not get off to a great start. \u00a0Frikken Hells Angels milling about outside the door. \u00a0LF tugged on my jacket...\"are you sure about this\"? \u00a0Oh yeah, they are a friendly bunch, cmon!  Place was packed but we found 2 empty stools near the door. \u00a01 stool spot had a pack of smokes and a beer bottle on the bar. \u00a0LF sat and the occupier of said stool came up behind me and grabbed his smokes and bottle, \"sit brother sit\"! \u00a0Turned around to give thanks and it was one of the Angels! \u00a0See honey, what'd I tell ya. \u00a0About peed my pants, don't tell her that though.  Well, the band was great, the crowd drunkin and friendly, met an interesting bloke from New Castle UK that was traveling the world, and the drinks were cheap. \u00a0Service great as well, plus it was the btenders bday and cake was passed around to all.  Oh yes, the bathrooms. Phew! \u00a0Sitting near the door was a good thing. \u00a0The men's room appeared to have been recently cleaned but 100+ years of missed targets cant be washed away. \u00a0   Great time again at The Saloon. \u00a0Hopefully this doesn't start the LF on the road to ruin......",

I knew they had live music and was not sure what to expect when I walked in. The first thing that got my attention was how smelly this place was! Then I noticed it also seemed very old and even a little decadent. Well, it is over 150 years old, after all. You are probably wondering why this is a 4 star review...  Ok, so as soon as I sat down at the bar and started paying attention to the music (really great blues on the Sunday night I was here), I just got it. This place is SO unique and SO San Francisco! Young, old, weird and classy, everyone got together to dig the music and show some moves on the dance floor. In a way I felt like I was in a movie with all of these extremely peculiar characters surrounding me: the red haired lady shaking her ass like a mad woman; the sweet bartender with his long white locks and very slim figure; the barely naked lady dancing as if there was no tomorrow... Everybody was having the time of their lives and it felt pretty magical to watch!  When the band had a break I left to have a cigarette and ran into some people on the little alley outside. Soon enough this guy who I had just seen dancing inside asks for my name, grabs a guitar and starts playing me a song, rhymes and all. I smiled, danced and kept thinking to myself \"this place is the real deal!\". If you are not into all of the very particular things I described above, maybe this is not the best bar for you. But I just loved it and will totally come back next time I am in town!",

The place smells like urine. When I asked the doorman why the place smells like urine, he told me it is because people urinate on the street and public pavement within yards of the entrance door. When I walk through the front door the overpowering stench of urine hits me. It's like a wall of urine smells. After standing inside the place for a few minutes, the nose becomes acclimated to the smell. It would be great if the owner/management would clean up the place so that customers weren't hit in the face with the overpowering smell of a public latrine when they walked through the front door. Other patrons have told me they have the same experience each time they enter The Saloon - the overpowering smell of urine.  One of the bartenders is a real asshole - rude, combative, and surly. This guy should go away from The Saloon. Management should get rid of him. One time I went there to have a drink, listen to music, dance, and meet people. He was working that night. I decided to leave as soon as I saw that he was working the bar that night. I went somewhere else to have a drink, listen to music, dance, and meet people.",

Having arrived before the \"cover period\" we assumed the cover charge should not and would not apply to the patrons who had been paying for weak drinks with poor service for several hours. The proprietors of the bar proceeded to shut music off at 930 and demand a cover charge from all current residents of the bar. I happened to be using the facilites during this shakedown and missed the collection jar. After buying a very weak drink from the bar upon my return from the little boys room, the bouncer jumped in my face demanding $5 and cursing at my party for not already giving the cover. He proceeded to recruit the bartender out from behind the bar to inform us they would no longer be serving us watered down adult beverages until we paid the cover. My first interaction with these people involved yelling and cursing despite my obvious intention to give them many of my hard earned dollars for crappy drinks and crappy service. We left without paying the cover charge based upon principal and extremely poor customer service. I am all for supporting local musicians, however the approach the proprietors of this establishment depend on are extremely crass and unnecessary.

In any event, I paid the $10 cover and went in with low expectations as can be expected of a bar called The Saloon off an alley from Little Italy.   I was pleasantly surprised, as can be expected of a bar called The Saloon off an alley from Little Italy that's jam packed with a diverse and friendly crowd, and echoing with searing blues licks of a kick ass house band. \u00a0I've heard a lot of house blues bands in my 26 years, and this was one of the best. I was so into the music that I forgot the name, but I think it was Danny Castro and the (somethings)? I could just be making that up.  The downsides to this juke joint are that the bar is cash only and has a limited selection of brews, and the space is pretty tight if there's a good crowd. Still, I was so down with the music and already buzzed from earlier in the night that I didn't care.   Seriously, the music was tight, and it was really great to see people of all ages and backgrounds getting down. It reminded me of the guitar duel scene from the Crossroads. Good movie, go rent it.   Back to The Saloon - I had a great time. I was loving the floor, I think I danced with a 70 something year old woman and a Tibetan midget. It was a great night.  Overall, if you're looking for a spot to let loose and dance to rockin' blues or bluesin' rock with a packed house, this may be your place.",

I live for institutions like this where that skanky bar smell that still has nicotine in the fine print.   The last time I remember actually sitting here, it was daytime, early afternoon, there was the sweetest skeksis bartender lady, I got the impression she was used to tending bar with her smokes but California had legislated that option away from her, she poured like they used to, like it was law, like an equalizer. After a few hours of sitting at her bar, quietly consuming Wild Turkey, I took in all that was around me. There are the clinical, the young, the old, the ones she wakes up, sets up and shoos out all sitting in consensus paying their courtesy at the bar. You might people who seem as if not everything is right when you look in their eyes. They might think the same about you. The insane might be you or they might be seated around you, dancing next to you or smiling to someone not even there. I love this place  This crowd has brothers and sisters drinking on 6th street and dancing in the doorways at 7 am in the 90's. You can find the ghosts of their cousins on Turk St on the corner of Taylor. All those places are falling away as the bureaucracy comes by like the revenue man with a clipboard, a minor and an old square chicken hawk. I'm glad this place has more stones than the ABC with a foundation since the Emancipation Proclamation and straight through Prohibition and the Twenty-first Amendment, punk rock, disco and crack.  I am going to go back, pay homage and promote sustainability so that The Saloon will be here when I'm gone. I won't get a last ovation but The Saloon will be a part of me as I passes into the urinal. They must have a bathroom but I can't remember if I used it in an official sense.  Like a reviewer posted earlier: dress for drinking. If you don't want a dive bar that your great-great-grand-daddy got shanghaied from that still has his dent in the door, from his head as he was thrown through, don't come by.",

But then he asked to see my ID and I realized he was the doorman.   So I go in there with my friend, a blonde from the south, who I can tell is a bit reluctant. She's just started poring over the extensive wine list (the choices are \"red\" and \"white\") when this grizzled old geezer of a bartender ambles up to her and growls: \"You wanna sit on my face?\"   We found out later that \"sit on my face\" is the name of a specialty shot they were serving that night, but that's sort of beside the point. The point is that the night only got better from there. The only beer on tap was Busch, which I was unaware still existed. The clientele tended toward the old, the ugly and the alcoholic, but not exclusively so. The music was lowdown, nasty-ass blues, the wooden dance floor was cramped and grimy, there was a fake christmas tree in one corner and a prostitute in another... It was basically everything you could ask for in a bar. I've returned many times since.  Highly recommended.",

Today, it's a packed like sardines, cash-only, hole-in-the-wall jazz and blues club. I happened in on the same night as the SantaCon so the place was surreally packed with people in Santa outfits in various states of inebriation. It just added to the anything goes, low key ambiance of the patrons and bar tenders in this dive bar. My vodka sodas were served in small glasses- maybe 6oz in size. These are the kind that I remember from my few visits to a VA Hall with my grandpa. It was probably for the best that they were small in size because they were big in alcohol.  Despite that cool history and fun vibe- I'm not going to lie- this place smells.
