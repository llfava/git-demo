    "review_text": "Brunch here was just okay. Presentation was super basic. Had a butterfly egg benedict and angus steak and eggs. The coffee was quite average and the orange juice tasted like a decent quality supermarket product. Very much felt like we could have cooked this at home in 10 minutes except it wouldn't have cost us $50. The waitress was exceedingly sweet but they were out of several things and she had to come back and apologize for that a couple of times. We ordered 3 times as a result. Ambiance was interesting, very old-timey San Francisco with an emphasis on \"old,\" as in gilt mirrors, quilted seats, pastel colors, heavy moldings. There were a few elderly hotel guests eating there and a large multigenerational Indian family and ethnic us, who seemed the most out of place. It was super quiet in the large dining room, almost hushed, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable, actually. I really wanted to like this place and felt kind of sad about the empty room and extremely boring, overpriced food. Maybe dinnertime is better? I hope so. Afterwards we went to Japantown and bought snacks to fill up. I hope this review doesn't sink this place, because I love San Francisco historical stuff like this, but they need to do something if they want their cafe to be a real destination. Make it more fun please and not so solemn! How about some music? Contemporary cuisine? Or go super kitsch/over the top? Something. Ahhhhhh!",

    "review_text": "Sorry, I wanted to like this place. Nice remodel of the dinning room. We were the only party in the dinning room one night.  Service was slow. The waitress was not well trained. We brought a bottle of wine to dinner and she was embarrassed to tell us about corkage.  She opened and started poring for all guest.  Food was marginal. No taste.  Had to ask a few times for check.  With proper training and a little flair, this could be great.",

It's small but cozy and drinks are reasonably priced. But beyond the drinks, the service is impecable. Mike, the bartender, is truly passionate about the drinks and he makes them with love. It's is fitting for this old establishment to have such a great, knowledgeable bartender, who truly cater to ones needs and likes.  We've gone three times now, and sure will be back for more drinks in this faboules, throw back place. Cheers!",

    "review_text": "This restaurant is now the Majestic Cafe, located in the quaint Majestic Hotel. My dinner here was one of the most uncomfortable dining experiences I've ever had -- though this wasn't the fault of the management, and the food actually was quite good, if overpriced.  We arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night to an empty dining room. Totally empty. It is a beautiful and ornate space, but with all the mirrors I don't think any patrons could have been hiding from us. It's hard enough to settle in to a nearly empty restaurant, but this was ridiculous. When we left, only two other parties had come in to eat.  To add to the discomfort, our waiter was on his first day serving his first table. A more experienced server coached him through the specials and desserts and watched his performance. Awkward!  I thought my caesar salad was excellent, and a linguine dish was not half bad. But it's hard to enjoy a night out when your restaurant of choice is so clearly off track.  I know I caught Majestic Cafe/Uptown Joe's on a down night, so a 3rd star would not have been out of the question. If you go, you may have a better time. But go soon... or you will miss your chance.",

We made reservation for Sat. 01/28/12, dinner on open table, no one was at the restaurant but us. Still a beautiful dinning room but the food sucks, it's not an American, not an Italian, not an Indian didn't know what kind food they try to serve and service by manager/waiter/buss boy was bad, we had better at danny's. Also, they canceled my reservation with open table, hello, we were the only people made a reservation and had a dinner. It's very sad that whoever took over the hotel and restaurant don't know what they have and can have. Don't waste your time or money in this place.",

    "review_text": "I really wanted to like the food. But I didn't and I got SO sick after eating dinner there. It was over priced and mediocre at best. I was staying in the hotel and within 3 hours of eating dinner there I was hugging my toilet. I was puking then had mudbutt all night! The following morning I spoke with the restaurant manager and the host guy that was standing there. I told them about getting sick (honestly it could've only been my dinner causing it). And they wouldn't believe me. I was told I couldn't get sick from their food because they only use fresh ingredients....just because its fresh doesn't mean you can't get sick from it! It's all in how the food is handled. The mgr also told me food poisoning doesn't set in for about 2 days after you eat. BS!! I've worked in the food industry and have my restaurant mgr level ServSafe certification. I know for a fact you can get sick from food within 30 minutes of eating. I'm very irritated at the fact y'all wouldn't believe someone can get sick from your food. It happens! You don't have to argue about it! A simple apology would've sufficed but the fact you kept telling me I was wrong &amp; that I couldn't get sick from there is just preposterous. I will NEVER come back. I haven't been sick like this in years.",

Alas, this was a great neighborhood spot I'll no longer be visiting.  And if the manger is reading this, PLEASE return my phone calls!",

    "review_text": "Comfort food, nothing special and city prices. Good bar and decent cocktails. Service comical! Imagine a waiter who has not only never waited tables before, but who has never been to a restaurant and seen anyone else serve. Only one other table occupied, yet our waiter could not keep the orders straight between the two tables. Drinks sat at the bar getting warm, eventually I went and grabbed my own, prompting the bartender to come out and serve other guests their drinks. Waiter eventually asked if we were ready to order, we looked down to remind ourselves of what we had picked, by the time we looked up, he was gone again! At least 15 minutes went by before he returned. A good 20 minutes elapsed between first course and main course. Food seemed to have been sitting ready in the kitchen for ages - it certainly wasn't hot. Three of our party were served, the fourth had to wait some more because our waiter decided to start serving another table. It was a display of charming incompetence worthy of Chaplin. An interesting way to spend 2.5 hours, but I won't be coming back.",
