Right away we all remarked on how beautiful the interior was. The dim calm lighting brought out the orange wall color with such class and comfort it was hard not to notice. \u00a0There was casual seating by the window for a small group (8 or so people) to relax and kick back with cold beer or even an appetizer or meal if they wanted to, there was seating at the bar, as well as tables along the wall and down through the center of the bar/restaurant. There were also two decent sized flat screen TV's playing two different football games (nothing irritates me more than a bar with 2 TV's not even 15 feet from each other with the same game on during football season). There was a friendly staff and a friendly atmosphere of patrons enjoying the rainy evening. We felt comfortable and cozy right away. The noise level was also just right. Not too loud, not too quiet. My friends and I could catch up without overhearing all the chatter around us or feeling like we were screaming at one another. To start, we had beer. Ice cold, delicious. Nothing better than COLD beer. Then, bring on the soul food!!  Let me start by saying that anyone with the audacity to complain about $7 soul food tapas doesn't really know what good food is, or what is put into it. Yes, I would complain if it was $7 and sucked, but the tapas were all DELICIOUS! Crispy Fried Pickles, AMAZING Grit Cakes with a mustard sauce, AMAZING Collared greens with Pork belly, AMAZING We even reached out for the $10 tapa menu for the fried green tomatoes, and the roasted garlic brie mac &amp; cheese both, \u00a0TO DIE FOR! Because we had stuffed ourselves on such delicious starters, we ordered only two entree's and decided to split them between our table of three.  We got a soul food supper plate with the Veggie and rice stuffed pepper as our main entree with the supper plate, and then we got the Grits and Creole Shrimp as our second entree. \u00a0 Let's just say, one member of our table, who will remain un-nammed, basically licked the bottom of both plates just to try to savor every last bit of flavor. That's how good it was.  In the end, the bill was reasonable split between all 3 of us, and we decided right then and there, we'll be back. Highly recommended to anyone who's looking for a delicious soul filled plate of soul food. My only suggestion, try to walk out, not roll out. You're almost guaranteed to over-eat in a place this good.. ENJOY!",

I've never had the full blackened catfish plate, but the catfish po'boys are great. I get them every time. 3 - They've got a few TVs, including a projector, so the game is probably on, and if not, they'll likely put it on. 4 - Tasty beer selection, even though it's not very big. Mostly tilted in the lighter direction, which is good when you're all hot &amp; sweaty from dancing. 5 - WAY cleaner bathrooms than Grant &amp; Green. Such a plus. Seriously.",

We picked our own table, and the staff would come check on us every ten minutes or so to make sure we were doing okay. We got the shrimp po-boy and fried chicken with mac and cheese (which they gave us two pieces of fried chicken for since they knew we were sharing!!). Shrimp po-boy was good, and the fried chicken was interesting with its lime flavor. I wasn't too into the mac and cheese - it had the seashell shaped pasta pieces and was also kind of lime flavored.

My friend and I were talking for a while and then it dawned on us that the food was taking a really long time. Before we even cared to get mad about it, our server came over and said, \"hey, your food seems to be taking a little long, the next round of drinks are on us.\" We thought that was awesome, and then our food came out 2 minutes later.   Before we ordered, we saw an amazing plate of fried chicken and mac n' cheese, so we had to get it. Our plate came out and had the sorriest piece of chicken on the plate. Luckily we were sharing a couple of items so it didn't bother us too much. A guy then comes out from the kitchen and says that he knows our piece is small and is making another piece for us. By time we ate all the food, we took the extra piece of chicken home.   Come for the laid back atmosphere, the great service and you HAVE to try the shrimp po'boy - so fresh and delicious.

Located in North Beach, Tupelo is spacious, clean, plenty of seating and great for happy hour. \u00a0The bartenders and staff are extremely friendly and attentive. \u00a0They have a cute lounge area with coffee tables and chairs as well as eating tables big enough to sit about 6. \u00a0Noise level is great for casual conversations.  The menu is a collection of robust Southern comfort dishes with a slight twist. \u00a0The chef really took these basic Southern dishes to a whole new level without losing any of it's integrity. \u00a0  Things that we've tried on the menu:  Burger w/ Tupelo Fries  - The burger was cooked medium rare.  - 1/2 a lbs  - Wide variety of toppings to choose from.  *Each time we've come here, we ordered the burger. \u00a0The first time was with Avocado and bacon. The second time was with blue cheese and candied bacon. The burgers were HUGE and tasted just as we thought it would. \u00a0Absolutely amazing. \u00a0The meat was cooked as we wanted, medium rare and the bacon was thick and crispy. \u00a0It's crazy messy and absolutely enourmous, but so worth it! \u00a0There are only a few places that I would ever get a burger, now Tupelo's is one of 4.  Pork Belly PoBoy  * You better be ready for this one. \u00a0It's a great combination of ingredients and it's melt in your mouth good. \u00a0SO worth every calorie. \u00a0  Grits with sauteed mushrooms  * Creamy deliciousness. They have a variety of different \"Grits and ...\" combinations. \u00a0I wish they had a sampler option, because it's hard to choose, they all sound delicious.  Other things we've tried and each in it's own way was unique and tasty:  Grit Cakes Spicy chicken wings Mac n Cheese with Garlic and brie Regular Mac n Cheese Fried Green Tomato's Boiled peanuts  This place definitely takes your standard night out for dinner \u00a0and drinks up a few levels to pure gluttony. \u00a0I love it!",

From the tapas section of the menu (available at all meals): * Crispy pickles with spicy aioli - $7. Five pickle spears deep fried in a thick layer of dough. Eating these was messy. Not a fan of how the dough kept separating from the pickles. * Roasted garlic + brie mac + cheese - $10. Small portion. Garlicky and good.  From the dinner menu: * Build your own grits - $7, with mushrooms +$4 and asparagus +$5. I was expecting more for the price, but the grits were really tasty. They were neither too greasy nor too bland, which I often find to be the case with grits. * Soul food supper plate (combo of one entree + one side) with fried chicken thighs and baked mac + cheese with cheddar + pepper jack - $15.

I stopped in San Francisco for a few days and heard about Tupelo and that if you don't like grits, then you have to try Tupelos. I haven't had a lot of experience with Southern Cuisine so I decided to expand my pallet. I ordered the Blackened Catfish, grits, fried pickles, and ham-hock croquettes. I had arrived on a Wednesday and the place was filling up fast because it was Trivia night. The ham-hock appetizer was a good way to start the meal. I enjoyed my dinner, and for the first time I liked grits! They had a more butter &amp; creamy taste that was far superior to creme of wheat tasting grits I had experienced earlier in Vegas. Catfish where I come from is not an item I would normally order. It's not a fish we respect much in Washington. Salmon is. I liked the Catfish, it was light and tasted good. The fried pickles was my favorite. A nice light salty flavor and not scalding to the bite like they've been at other places I've tried them. I ended up staying for Trivia night and looked at what the other patrons were ordering and everything looked delicious! I started to wonder about the other items on the menu. The hamburgers &amp; waffle fries were popular, and the special was the Fried Chicken supper, but I wanted to be more adventurous. I ended up having so much fun meeting cool people that I stayed till the late night menu, and tried the Pulled-Pork Sliders which complimented my draught beer perfectly. I had so much fun that next time I'm in San Francisco, I am coming back to try those hamburgers.",

On a subsequent visit, ordered two items \u00a0-- Mac n' Cheese and Collard Greens. The Mac was the most dry, flavorless, bland I have literally ever had. Pushed it away after three bites. Collard greens were a soup of water, oil and salt -- inedible. I never send things back or complain, but did mention to bartender as she cleared and clearly noticed that all was uneaten. She just kinda nodded and said, \"I know\". No attempt to fix, etc. $20 for inedible food and not even an apology. At minimum, I wish she had told me I was ordering bad items.

Mostly blues/rock on the weekends, with an assortment of other classic bar activities (karaoke, trivia, Sunday bingo, etc) all happening too.  You're not going to find craft cocktails with shaken egg whites here (head over to 15 Romolo if that's your thing), but they have a great selection of beers on tap and the attentive bartenders make stiff cocktails. It's a huge space, too, so generally you're not having to fight your way through a crowd on your way to the bar like every single bar on Polk St.  Tupelo's food is often overlooked in a neighborhood with so many restaurants, but is a really great \u00a0lunch/dinner option: the fried okra, burger, po boys, and even the Caesar/blackened chicken salad are all great.  Lastly, my friends and I have had a variety of private events here, ranging from entire buyouts for New Year's to simple birthdays. Teague and the staff have been incredible to work with every time and gone above and beyond to make the events great.",

Lots of popped collars and caps twisted to the side. Server was really nice. I'm a big fan of the music they were playing, but couldn't find similar stuf on the jukebox. Would have expected more blues.  Onto the food: I know Chef Mark Danziger now specializes in southern food, but it's pretty obvious he doesn't really get it. The food was pretty good, but it fell short in quite a few places. We had: Chicken Wings: I didn't have any, but my fellow diners loved them Cornbread with honey butter: awesome and definitely traditional Grits: the grits themselves tasted good but were more runny than I've ever had them in the south, I had them with pork belly and brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were amazing and very traditional: almost overcooked but done just to the point that they don't get the sulphur taste. The pork belly was good, but tasted pretty bland next to the brussel sprouts.  Fried Okra: They were super bland, and the sauce they served them with was really strange. I LOVE okra southern style, so this was really disappointing.  Overall, it wasn't the comfort food I was looking for. If I'm going to indulge in the unhealthy stuff, I'd rather go somewhere where the taste is worth it.",

Spending $50 between the two of us plus a drink was great.  Took a while to have our order taken. Food arrived quickly afterwards. Server couldn't have been nicer. You could tell he was trying.

Pork belly was delicious, good flavor. Overall I enjoyed my dish. Price was appropriate.   I'm not dying to come back just for the food, but it was pretty good.

THE BRUNCH MENU has 5 items (only)  1) Breakfast cornmeal- seared shrimp, scallions, poached egg: $12 2) Pulled Pork Sandwich - slow braised pork, house slaw, french fries: $8 3) French Toast - Thick cut brioche, bacon, syrup: $11 4) Tupelo Hot wings - spicy wet wings, steak cut french fries: $9 5) American Breakfast- two eggs sunny side up, sausage, toast: $7  You seat yourself, Since we quickly realized we were gonna be hard-pressed to spend the $30 on food, we ordered a bloody mary for Norman ($8, and way too horse-radishy).  The waitress told us the only two things the kitchen could make right now (since it was prepping) was the wings or the American breakfast. \u00a0We decided to order the wings, and wait the 20 minutes until we could order something besides the American breakfast - AND to see how hungry we would be after the wings. \u00a0(Though knowing what was to transpire, I wish I had just sold the Groupon to another neighboring table and left)  Anyway - the table next to us orders and get their drinks. \u00a0we wait for the bloody, then finally have to remind our waitress about the cocktail, she takes a while to get it and comes back and says the kitchen won't be ready for ANOTHER 35 minutes. \u00a0   We get the wings - the fries are under-done, and they were okay wings, nothing spectacular. But after we eat them we realize we are done with this place, that it might be another hour (or whoever knows how long until the kitchen is running, and if the wings were any indication of quality, why bother?)  We spied a couple of old acquaintances at the bar who were drinking and watching football, and we asked our waitress to just credit the $15 we didn't spend on our Groupon and have it applied against their tab. (She said she would), the waitress was in a tough spot , she said it was her first day -and really most of the problems were coming from the kitchen. \u00a0Now we will never know if the $15 credit got to our friends... but you win some, you lose some.  To add complete insult to injury I went to the ladies room before I left and they have those HUGE TP rolls inside the plastic, and once one roll ends you slide the bottom to get to the other roll. \u00a0Both rolls were full, but the only roll exposed was all wet, so impossible to get any quantity of paper off it other than in 1\" wet scraps.   All the other reviews about brunch are right. Sadly the dinner reviews looks good, but avoid at all costs for brunch!  I would have been MUCH happier with a couple slices of Golden boy pizza!",

Came on a Thursday night with some friends for dinner and drinks. \u00a0There was lots of open space as there were not too many tables...some improvements could be made on their furniture floor plan. \u00a0Our waitress was funny and peppy but not in an annoying way at all. \u00a0The food was reasonably priced, but the drinks took up a hefty chunk of the bill ($8 glasses of wine and I think $10-12 cocktails). \u00a0But now onto the goods:  Specialty \u00a0Cocktails : the \"Steve McQueen\" - super sweet, as it was a sweet tea vodka drink the \"Ray Charles\" - whiskey and bitters. mmm  Apps: Fried Pickles - I mean, how can you go wrong Brussel sprouts and bacon - gotta get your veggies somehow right? i'm sure if \u00a0my mother had cooked brussel sprouts like this when I was a kid I would have been so much more excited to eat them Roasted Garlic and Brie Mac and Cheese - if there is one thing you should get here, it is this. It is heavenly. It is glorious. I wish I could eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \u00a0  Dinner: Candied bacon burger with pepper jack - It is everything you dreamt of and more. Candied bacon is the new black. Just do it.  Dessert: Apple crisp a la mode - I don't really like fruit-based desserts (I'm a chocoholic and damn proud of it) but oh. my. god. The four of us dove into this at lightning speed. It was gone before you could blink.   Overall this is a great new spot - a perfect place to start your night, especially in the heart of North Beach with so many other bars around to venture to after the meal. \u00a0I think they still have some things to work out \u00a0since they are so new so I can't give them a 5 yet.",

But when I saw a cheeseburger with candied bacon and blue cheese which really caught my attention. \u00a0It sounds so terrible, yet I know it's addictive and intensely tasty if I give it a chance. \u00a0I tend to be against too much messing around with burgers, but all the versions here at Tupelo are intriguing and sound well conceived. \u00a0Fried pickles, Pork broth boiled peanuts (an acquired taste I imagine), Pork Belly Po Boy, roasted garlic and brie Mac 'n cheese, grits served in many ways inventive and ordinary, \u00a0salads and small plates that spark the imagination and are all pretty damned good. \u00a0But I'm your burger guru, and the burgers here at Tupelo are really top notch in ingredients, preparation, presentation and delivery, and I love their waffle fries too. \u00a0I have to add that the staff here are winners, charming, fun and committed to making everyone's Tupelo experience one they will remember and want to return for more, and more. \u00a0A great place that also has a great bar and bartenders.",

It was cooked right, so you can tell the kitchen knew what they were doing.   BUT HOLD ON! The pork belly was cold in the center. My boyfriend spit it out immediately and instead dug into the fried okra and mac and cheese (which were both good). My theory is that since the place was really slow the entree was cooked a day or two before and then reheated. The dish was still actually really flavorful and good, but it was really strange that it was cold in the center.... fully cooked.... it wasn't underdone at all....  My catfish was the same. It came out warm with a lukewarm center.... a blackened catfish....   You might think that maybe they left it out for a while. But that couldn't be true because it came out oddly quick..... like in ten minutes after we ordered. Also, if it was left out, then the center would be hot and the outside would be cold. \u00a0But both dishes were cold on the inside.   Bleh.",

We had parking so we decided to roam the neighborhood for a different place. North Beach was packed with tourists and so were he the restaurants. We walked by Tupelos and saw an open table so we went in. They have a full bar and sports on, so that was a big plus. We started with some apps, the chicken wings, fried pickles, ham hock croquettes and pulled pork sliders. All the apps were good but the sliders were my favorite. We enjoyed our mains, the pork belly po' boy was good but more tomatoes than pork belly. One friend got a green salad and the greens tasted smoky, which we all thought was a bit strange. The place got a bit busy and our waiter Darren was working alone, bartender, busser and waiter all in one. He handled it in stride and was very nice. I'll go back, though I don't go down to North Beach that often.",

San Francisco doesn't have enough places that serve soul food/Southern cuisine, so I was beyond excited when this place opened up in our new neighborhood a couple of weeks ago.   Tonight, Mr. Brooklyn and I dug into the following: baked mac 'n' cheese, mascarpone grits, shrimp po' boy, fried green tomatoes, and pecan pie for dessert. Truthfully, although the tomatoes were pretty good, the breading was a tad bit heavy for my taste; a lighter coating would have really allowed the tomato flavor to shine through. I washed my meal down with a cosmo, which fortunately featured a generous pour of vodka (shhh, don't tell anyone, I'm trying to look cool over here and avoid the perception that I'm some sort of Sex-and-the-City throwback from 1999). We emerged from Tupelo 500 pounds heavier and extremely satisfied with the meal, the standouts being the po' boy, the grits, and the over-the-top-amazing pie.   Other bonuses: friendly service, plenty of space in which to enjoy our meal (not too crowded yet!), and a fabulous jukebox that allowed me to savor my grits to the strains of The Jam, The Clash, and The Smiths. Looking forward to going back and enjoying the collard greens, cornbread, and Brussels sprouts next time around.",

Had I not eaten all day and had we not just walked up a huge hill, (and I was tired!) I would have gone somewhere else.  The inside is... well, I guess there's just no other way to put it... seedy. We came here for food and it's more of a bar...and not even a nice one. It's not a gastropub by any means of the imagination...and I really don't understand Southern soul food coming from a grungy bar. I guess I should have realized this.  On their website, they mention something about a southern fried chicken dinner special on Wednesday. This sounded good. When we got there and saw the menu, it's non-existent. We asked our waitress who didn't seem to really know what that was. Okay...  The bar seating - uncomfortable. We then moved down to a couple tables in the front and ate there. Not to mention that the seats were really dirty. Yuck. If these are dirty, I can only imagine what the kitchen must look like.  The food was horrible.  I had the chicken dinner (since they \"didn't have the chicken and waffles yet\") and I was so disappointed. The fried chicken was burnt. The breading didn't have a terrible taste but it was overwhelmed with a burnt taste. I will admit that the inside of the chicken was moist but as I said, the burnt breading overwhelmed the dish. I didn't like it.   The southern slaw that it came with was off. It was sour and peppery? and just didn't taste right to me. I only had a few bites and that was it. Ick.  It also came with a rosemary herb biscuit which was atrocious. It tasted like a salt brick and was dry as a bone. Definitely either old or wasn't baked properly. For a second, I thought I was back as a prisoner in Alcatraz (since we had just come from there) since where else would I be able to get a salt biscuit like that?!   The mashed potatoes were the only saving grace. They were okay. Could have easily been from a box but at least they were edible.  My boyfriend had the ribs which I tasted the mirapoix which was on the ribs. They definitely did not reduce the red wine out of that sauce. Yuck! I'm not sure how he ate it.   Lastly, the restaurant is not sealed properly. The smell of people smoking outside wafts through all the cracks in the windows. Yuck.  Terrible food. Lousy atmosphere. I will never go back.",

We ordered the wings and as soon as you take a bite, heaven in your mouth. they were amazing and are probably one of my favorite wings.  I could have made my dinner off them wings!",

Both times been here were on a weeknight; a Yelper brought us here after a YEE so I brought other yelpers again. Half full on weeknights is a good thing if you don't want crowds. However, it was still pretty popping fun! And, the wait for drinks or to get your karaoke song in is pretty quick. I can imagine this place being packed on the weekend considering its location.  Inside the place looks like a larger and brighter dive bar except with a stage for singing and a live karaoke DJ. The DJ sings along if needed, and even plays a music instrument if it is in the song! How fun is that?!  There are a bunch of song folders but the list is not extensive - nor overwhelming - with popular songs and somewhat up to date. There is a large projection screen and \u00a0TVs all around to help you with the words. You choose a song, write it down and deposit into a small bin container by the DJ set. Then, you wait until the DJ announces it's your turn to sing. There is no payment required but donations are accepted.  Note I've noticed a higher number of rap and hip-hop songs performed here but the singers are definitely not urban (have you ever seen a middle-aged/retiree rapping before?) which makes it fun for everybody.",

Patriots football at a southern inspired bar is weird to me. \u00a0Particularly when you refuse to show games for teams that are actually from the south.  Also, they have drastically cut down their brunch menu. \u00a0They now have a 5 item menu, and only 2 of the items were actually available today... The only reason they get 2 stars is that the \"American breakfast\" was decent.

Dinner - Now dinner was a MUCH tastier experience for us (or maybe it was just the foods we chose). We had the Tupelo burger (delicious but greasy), Garlic Mac&amp;Chz (overpriced for the size but good flavor), &amp; the Mixed Green Salad (really tasty &amp; smoky). \u00a0As other reviewers mention, the burger IS really tasty, but my date and I both thought it was fairly greasy, and our stomachs definitely agreed. \u00a0  Overall the dinner was a pleasant surprise for a bar, and so unique to San Francisco.

    "review_text": "Alas, the Niners may have lost the Super Bowl this year, but Tupelo won as a nice, mellow bar with just enough hipster flair to make me feel cool, but not too much to make me feel really self conscious about liking pop music. I was expecting complete craziness for the game, but the bartenders performed admirably and with a smile on their faces :)  Yummy chicken wings, delicious Big Daddy IPA on tap and nice people. Thanks for a good time Tupelo.",
