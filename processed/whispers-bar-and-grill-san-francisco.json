I wasn't sure whether its 2 or 3 stars.. its sunday night in soma, and the only benefit of this place is that its open.",

My totally amazing co-worker who is not on Yelp agrees. The food is typical pub fare, but coming here is like being in your own living room, so comfortable and friendly. \u00a0A great place to watch the game, enjoy a brew, and meet new friends. \u00a0The only negative thing I have to say is don't order the salmon.",

    "review_text": "I wandered downstairs for a drink around 9:30 PM. I was extremely disappointed that there were only two other people at the bar (both were having beers), but the bartender was extremely friendly. I knew exactly what I wanted- the San Francisco Iced Tea for $12 (I had been staring at the specialty cocktail menu upstairs in my room all afternoon, and couldn't wait to try it!). The drink was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! The bartender was surprised at how quickly I drank the cocktail... various bartenders have marveled at how quickly I'm able to inhale the first couple of drinks and remain sitting upright in my seat (maybe it's a sign that I should slow down). I asked him for a suggestion (I don't like anything too sweet), and he made me an appletini. Also very tasty! After a couple of drinks though, I had to head out for the night because there wasn't much activity going on.  I will definitely come back to this bar the next time I'm in SF!",

    "review_text": "I came here for a drink after work due to a recommendation from a friend and am quite pleased with what I found; a secret bar that is perfect for the after work drink / happy hour. \u00a0Recently remodeled and located in the Courtyard Marriott on 2nd street, Whispers is never too crowded and has a great vibe. \u00a0It's a great place to hang out after work, watch some sports, and have a beer or five. \u00a0I love it when I walk in and Laurie, Anton and the rest of the staff will run from behind the bar, hug me and parade me around the hotel lobby like Eli Manning after the Super Bowl until I beg to be let down 1 hour later. \u00a0I think they think I'm Jet Li, but I never disagree with them because they make great drinks and maybe I shouldn't have told them that my name was Jet Li. \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0   Anyway, I digress. \u00a0It's weird to think that a Courtyard Marriott has a cool spot but this place is full of out of towners getting ready to paint the town red, stewardesses (for you guys out there) and really friendly staff. \u00a0There is a smoking patio and convenient bathroom access, which is a must when you are watching a shoot out between the 49ers and Cardinals. \u00a0I mean, you wouldn't want to miss a fumble or 5. \u00a0I will occassionally bring my laptop and work on the free wireless while sipping on a glass of wine trying to bring the silicon valley vibe to the north bay. \u00a0  Apparently, a lot of sports stars hang out here too due to the proximity to the SBC ball park. \u00a0I came here during the Giants Alumni weekend for a drink and dinner and saw Kirk Rueter, Mark Gardner, and Rob Nenn hanging out. \u00a0It was cool to see those guys there but I couldn't tell if they were hanging with really unattractive groupies or their wives. \u00a0Anyway, the atmosphere here is quite chill. \u00a0Perfect for a group of 4 or more for happy hours. \u00a0The food is actually pretty good.   We will stop by occasionally to grab a drink before we go out sometime. \u00a0Only con, last call is at 11:45 p.m.",

I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was delicious! \u00a0The chicken was oh so tender AND it came with yummy guacamole and pico de gallo. \u00a0I would definitely order this again. \u00a0The quesadilla was something like $11. \u00a0I was super naughty tonight because I ordered the sea salt fries appetizer on top of this (the quesadilla is also on the appetizer menu). \u00a0The special dipping sauce that came with the fries really made this appetizer divine. \u00a0The sauce was made of horseradish, aioli, and probably some other ingredients. \u00a0It went very well with the fries.  To counter all this grease that I ordered, I scooped some lettuce pieces from Cam S.'s chicken caesar salad, as well as some green beans from my kid sister. \u00a0The green beans were unique; each bean was cut in half and very flavorful. \u00a0The salad was good with delicious, freshly grated parmesan. \u00a0It probably could've done without half the amount of dressing. \u00a0Those poor lettuce pieces were drowning in salad dressing.  In sum, the food is tasty, but somewhat on the pricey side for what it is. \u00a0The service is so great and so speedy. I'm a fan!",

    "review_text": "Business here is much like a whisper. It never seems to be busy, but that just means faster service for me! I'll come to the Courtyard Marriott to get work done sometimes, and the staff has a lot of ground to cover in terms of customers. They constantly patrol the actual bar area, the lounging area with tables next to the patio area, and then the patio area itself. They're all super sweet, and I've never had a problem with the service here.  As for the food, I love their sea salt fries with onion dip ($6). There is a reasonable amount of fries for that price, and their onion dip is pretty good. Interesting... but good. I have also had their caesar salad with chicken. The chicken does not taste very fresh, but the rest of it does! And they had a generous amount of dressing, which I appreciate. Overall good prices for hotel bar food, so it's totally getting some while you're here.",

Wouldn't recommend expecting to eat here. Lots of people moving around, so not easy to flag down someone to order food from.  Drinks were okay. Can get pretty loud after work-hours as people from the surrounding area and within the hotel come down for a drink.  There's a nice courtyard to chill at outside if you're not feeling the inside.",
