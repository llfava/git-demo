Note to self: don't come here after 8pm with a big group of alcoholics. Maybe it won't be a problem if they accidentally push someone over and pretend they weren't sitting there.

Let's judge the place for what it has control over:  1.) Drinks - great menu and love the fresh squeezed citrus and various herbs/veggies on hand. 2.) Price - it's San Francisco and it's Pacific Heights. \u00a0If you're looking for a place to get wasted and stretch your last $10, try the Hotel Utah Saloon off 4th in SoMa. 3.) Service - bartenders tend bar. \u00a0Ours made the drinks as ordered. \u00a0Not over the top personality and not a bump on a log. \u00a0Good for business. 4.)

Every night (because we were 21 &amp; went out every night), we'd go to Lion Pub &amp; order a drink &amp; then eat \"dinner\" at the cheese spread before hitting the town. Now I'm not sure if they still have that fantastic spread -- probably because 21 year old degenerates like myself would wolf down plate after plate over their gourmet cheeses &amp; smoked salmon -- but man, the drinks here are to die for. Any drink that has fresh fruit, they squeeze it per order. The HH are strong &amp; the Greyhounds are something else (though I'd pony up &amp; get something other than the well vodka) -- though a note of warning: if it's a Friday or Saturday night, I'd stick to something that's easy to pour or pop because it can get very crowded &amp; backed up. In fact, I wouldn't go if it was a Friday or Saturday night (remember, 21 degenerates like it here...)  But all said &amp; done, while I'm very far from 21, Lion Pub remains one of my favorite places to pull up a stool, throw my arm around my honey, nurse a cocktail or nine &amp; reminisce about all those wonderful memories -- at least those that I can remember ;)",

I think fresh-squeezed juices in cocktails might become a thing if it catches on. In about the next 30 minutes, people just started flowing in and the place got packed by 11pm. Half the place had tables and chairs for groups of people, with a nice fireplace there, and the other half was mostly the bar area where people do the whole stand and look cool thing. The tables were taken by 10:30pm and so we were stuck standing in no-man's land by the corner of the bar. If you want a table you should go early. Overall, it was a decent vibe. It was pretty mellow with a zest of maturity tossed in too. I'm 23, so the crowd felt a little bit older to me. I'd say late 20's to early 30's, single professional types.

Turns out they have great drinks (a bit pricy but you get what you pay for). \u00a0I hear the mojitos are awesome, though I really enjoyed my Screwhound (vodka with fresh pressed orange and grapefruit juices). \u00a0My date had a chocolate raspberry martini which she loved, and a blackberry lemon drop which, while tasty, left her wishing she had repeated her first order. \u00a0The free cheese and crackers are perfect for taking the edge off, and the dark, fireplace lounge make the place extra inviting. \u00a0Was there on a Thursday night and enjoyed the crowd until 11, when it became a tad douche-y; that was our cue to leave.  Minus a star for being cash only. \u00a0I will be back before 7pm to check out the happy hour.",

The drinks are kinda expensive, 8-9 dollars for the fruity mojitos and stuff, but for the more frugal drinker they also have Greyhounds (vodka + grapefruit juice=YUM) for a measly 5 bucks. \u00a0  I recommend getting a really fruity drink (i.e. Strawberry Mango Mojito, Blueberry Pineapple Mojito, or \u00a0Strawberry Lemon Drop) and then switching it up to greyhounds the rest of the night, saves some money and gets you more alcohol.  They also have food here, and not your typical bar food, but damn good food...Cheeses, crackers, smoked salmon, guacamole, chips, etc...   Don't forget your cash though, credit cards are not accepted.",

There are only 3-4 bartenders at one time and considering how crowded this pub can get, they do a fantastic job at getting drinks for everyone in a timely manner. This place is definitely a unique find because they have these old school iron casted juicers that they use to squeeze fresh lime/orange/grapefruit/lemon into your drink which makes everything taste exponentially better.  My favorite drink of the night was a strawberry mojito - probably the best mojito I've ever had solely because the strawberries and lime were super fresh - definitely hides how strong the drink actually is. I loved it when I found strawberry chunks at the bottom of the glass - a little bite of fruit is always a good thing.  Another great drink was the watermelon vodka. In each drink is a handful of fresh watermelon crushed into the glass and topped off with a probably not so healthy helping of vodka. Can't say that I liked the grapefruit vodka only because I don't like grapefruit - it's too sour.  Anyway, LOVE the old school juicers, love the environment and I LOVE the fact that I'll definitely be back!",

The not so good part includes having no food on the menu, the bitchy bartender, and being way too dark inside. \u00a0I came around dinner time hoping for food to munch on only to find out they don't serve any and they don't do \"free cheese and crackers\" anymore. Next, the bartender accidentally sprayed water in my face and didn't have the decency to say anything. He looked pretty angry all night too. Lastly, I really don't like how dark it is in there. It makes me uncomfortable to be unable to see where I'm going or who I'm talking to.   I'll come back, but only because they use real fruits in their drinks and the place is close to work.

There are many, many people on Yelp who have discounted some of my favorite bars based on the low comfort level they've felt being surrounded by hipsters and indie rockers with tight t-shirts and peacock hairdos.  I've always thought that this was a bit of a cop-out. Why can't you just be comfortable wherever you go? Why alienate yourself based on these superficial ingroup classifications?  I now understand. While I neither look like an extra from a Cure video or a roadie for Creedance Clearwater Revival circa 1968 (these being the two main motifs for hipster/indie fashion), I CERTAINLY feel like less of an ass in that crowd than I do in the J. Crewed, manicured world of the Lion's Den.   While I was by no means paralyzed by this social atmosphere, I certainly wasn't going to embark on a mission to make new friends or find a nice girl. My friends and I stuck to our table.  So why did we stick around? The drinks, of course. Any bar equipped with three grapefruit presses to make fresh greyhounds is okay in my book- and if that place has a spread of free food for you to nibble on, even better. The tabouleh was pretty darn good, I must say. There's also a watermelon/vodka cocktail that is fantastic- much more appropriate for a hot and humid summer day back east than the cool breeze and fog found in San Francisco in August.  Three stars for now. I'll give it another shot. Maybe a weekday Happy Hour or something.",

They also provide free food to nosh on which I think is really nice of them. \u00a0By the time of the evening when we got to the free food table, it was mostly gone, but lots of cheese and bread and crackers, fruits, and chips and dips. \u00a0Not bad. \u00a0  So it was pretty packed, but it wasn't obscene. \u00a0I could still move around and not spill anyone's drink. \u00a0They apparently are known for their super sweet yummy drinks which I didn't get to try, but I will do next time. \u00a0Service was slow but that is to be expected with the huge crowd here. \u00a0  The crowd in here was good looking, nice and fun. \u00a0It kinda reminded me of SoCal but without the fakeness. \u00a0  If I lived nearby I could see myself coming here all the time. \u00a0But since I don't I may not be back soon, but if I do come back I can almost guarantee myself a fun time here.",

However, It's more a neighborhood joint, and sometimes i feel like it's kind of clicky, because lots of people seem to hang out in groups, talking to each other. So, it's probably a good place to meet a group of friends, but if you're single and mingling, this may not be the spot for you.  It's cool because it's out of the way, not where you might expect. This is very charming until it's 2AM and time to leave, and you have to really be pushy to compete for the few taxis out that way (Uber is good in this situation). Also, bartenders are extremely good at making drinks, and they are super friendly in a very loud and crowded joint.  Mixed fancy drinks are expensive, but they are delicious! Try their mojitos, they are amazing and will get you drunk quick. They do not take credit cards, so make sure to stop at the ATM and pull out a fair amount of cash, as it will disappear quickly.  Show up here late and a little wasted, and you will have better luck meeting people, or, kick off the night here with a LARGE group of friends. You won't be disappointed.",

I loved the dim atmosphere, and all the lion decorations everywhere. It wasn't like anywhere I had ever been, and I like that about this place.  They played awesome music (a little loud at times which didn't bother me so much), and plenty of seating that night. I ordered a greyhound for myself, and a mojito for my friend. Every cocktail is fresh squeezed right in front of you. This makes a HUGE difference in the taste of the drink. I can confidently say this was the BEST cocktail I've had in my life.  There's really absolutely nothing I can complain about this place. I will have to go back on a busy day to see how that is. I'd like to go back to see the place packed on a weekend , as I'm sure the vibe is a little different then. I'm looking forward to more amazing cocktails and memories at Lion Pub.",

Dark mystic interior, warm gas lit fireplace, spacious seating, mix of old and new, kitschy and trendy, white lion marble statues and buddah in the corner (?), neon lights and ethnic printed hides hanging on the walls, bathroom with a separate toilet and an open sink.  Bar tender was friendly, mixed up some fresh fruit drinks- bloodhound (twist on my fav greyhounds with blood orange instead of grapefruit; still tangy but I'd recommend an upgrade from the well vodka).  Place gave a cool, laid-back vibe, but it was blasting party music a little too loud for the early evening crowd. I could imagine it gets pretty wild later in the night. I saver the earlier scene, and could do without the music. Can't say much for the demographics- looks like it might drawn in some of the Marina crowd.",

    "review_text": "There are three distinct types of reviews that I see for this place. The first is the 5 star, written by the yelper I have never seen in my life or, if I have, clearly did not connect with in any way, shape or form. Then there is the 1 star review that uses the words \"douchebag\" and \"striped shirt\" at least a half a dozen times. The rest are reviews that teeter on the edge of using these words but instead the words \"free snack food\" creep in, thus raising the rating.   Lets think for a minute about the friends we have. We all probably have at least one of the following; The friend that is super cool until they drink too much (you know who you are). The friend who would live and die for you but has a high level of drama, which you have to comfort them through in exchange for said loyalty. How about the friend who you met when they were on a healthy, healing dose of meds but has since switched brands making them bat shit crazy, but still remain your friend because they are a good person and you are convinced they will switch back to brand A even if it does make hair grow in strange places on their body.  This bar is just like one of those \"friends\" and on the weekends it is in a cycle that makes you want a little, no, a LOT of distance. Come the early part of the week it is having an upswing and is not just tolerable but a damn joy to be around.   After all, this bar has good drinks with fresh fruit, good music, a super cool relaxing interior with plants, a fireplace, plenty of seating, and they have funny animal statues which are just plain cool in a tacky way. Oh and lets not forget that free food mentioned prior which, unlike the \"douchebag\" clientele, who apparently do not eat, I am not too proud to dig into.   So, 5 stars on a quiet night, and 1 star on a weekend. But, really, didn't I just describe three quarters of the bars in San Francisco?   So, to that effect, I give this bar 3 stars and a warning to stay away from it when it is drunk, stressed out or not on its meds ie. DO NOT COME HERE ON THE WEEKEND!!!",

Now I live in Oakland and work in SF. \u00a0The alleged Lion Pub has graced many a conversation as that awesome bar with free snacks and the place where they pour vodka in a glass, place it under a juice press and squeeze half a grapefruit in it to make a greyhound. \u00a0  I spoke so euphorically of the Lion Pub that folks began to doubt its existence. \u00a0Some started calling it my \"Shangri-La\" bar that only seemed that good cause it was a long time ago and I was probably way too wasted. \u00a0So naturally, a re-visit was in order.

However I think that speaks more to the abundance of great neighborhood bars here in SF and not so much to the Lion Pub itself. It's perfectly acceptable, especially as a spot to grab a night cap on the way home... the drinks are decent, the crowds don't typically get too overwhelming, and they've often had out a table of snacks set up during the few times I've dropped in. Enjoyable cocktails + a place to sit + cheese platter = just fine by me.",

And pretty good ones, even if they are a little stale by the time I get there. There's usually a cheese plate, sushi, a little bit of fruit, and usually some kind of bread and dip.   The mojitos are to die for with yummy fresh squeezed juice and menus that are consistently rotated with what's in season. Because they squeeze the juice when you order, \u00a0be prepared for a long wait to order your drink when it's crowded, but it's well worth it. Also bring plenty of cash, because the drinks are pricey and they don't take cards. You're more than welcome to use their ATM for a surcharge though.  Downside is that it can get very crowded. This might be changing, because l came by about a month ago, and had to wait outside in a line. I'd never had to do this before, so I thought that the bar was going to be worse than I'd ever seen it. Imagine my surprise when I got in to find about 1/2 the crowd I'm used to. I don't know if they got busted by the fire marshall or what, but I like it!  The decor is like a swanky jungle - but beware, as I've learned, sitting on the lion is frowned upon!",

It makes for great people watching, and if you get a Marina guy on a good night (meaning he isn't trying to get into the pants of a blonde Marina girl) they can actually be funny to talk to.  I HIGHLY recommend their mojitos, and their greyhounds are fabulous. Hands down the BEST mojitos I have had in the city so far.  PLUS they have food. OMG. This basically gives me free license to drink myself silly because I have food at my disposal, and lovely cheese.   The decor is fun and different, and the bartenders are pretty mellow too.  Do note that they only take cash, so be prepared with some $20s or suck up and use the ATM.   Also, I recommend weeknights as to truly enjoy the bar and ambiance.

Now, a lousy 2 stars describes my experience last Friday night. Here's how it went down...I walked the 5 blocks it takes me to get to the bar from my house and pull out my I.D for the door man. Right then a young man opens the door and says \"dude, douche bags!\". The door man explains to me that it was that bartender and I joke that he should be more picky when letting people in.  Right when I walk inside I realized this is a completely different experience I had ever had at this bar. First and foremost I would like to reference the Music. This place used to have a great sound track, but Friday night....techno and club beats! what? at the lion pub?  The place was packed, the lighting was dark (which is pretty normal for the pub) and i couldn't even hear myself talk over the blasting music. I left right after i finished my drink.... A word for the bartender who is complaining to the doorman about the crowd he's letting in...change the playlist on you ipod and maybe you wont attract so many douchebags!   How I will miss the greyhounds with fresh squeezed grape fruit juice!   ps. what happened to Doug? .",

    "review_text": "The Lion Pub is famous for a few things...  1) All their drinks feature freshly squeezed juice (they have an old school juicer at the bar). 2) They offer complimentary crackers and cheese late in to the night. And if you've been drinking for a while, this can save you from a nasty hangover the next morning. 3) They have a cozy fireplace (perfect for a first date). 4) It used to be a gay bar back in the day. Now it mostly appeals to Pac Heights heteros and metrosexuals. 5) No one seems to get the name right of this place. I've heard people refer to it as the Lion's Bar, the Lion's Den, etc. Folks - it's called the Lion Pub (plain and simple).  Personally, I prefer coming here Sunday - Wednesday when it's less crowded. It's a nice, intimate spot for a tasty cocktail and good conversation. But come Thursday - Saturday, this place turns in to a raucous frat party. Don't get me wrong, this is probably a fun scene if you're in your early 20s. But I'm in my late 30s, so I'm less inclined to hang out in a loud bar and wait 20 minutes for a drink (Boy, do I sound old or what?!!).  In any case, if you're looking for a cool bar that caters to in-the-know locals, Lion Bar will serve you well.   ** FYI, this is a cash-only bar (no credit cards). They do have an in-house ATM near the bathroom, but the service charge is pretty steep. Please plan accordingly.",

Honestly, this place is at it's best right when it opens at 5pm on the weekends or on any weeknight. It has a very 70s cave-man/log cabin kind of vibe with the exposed stone walls and fireplace. They're always playing the best random mix of 90's, grunge, punk, classic rock, electro, and generally awesome hits from the past 10 years. Their fresh fruit cocktails can't be matched, especially their strawberry mojito, and one of their margaritas definitely left me feeling quite saucy. Bonus points for the free cheese and cracker spread. They also have some pretty amazing names for their shots, like the Chuck Norris and Kurt Cobain for example.

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I tried their Chimney Top; I like lemon drops and I like scotch, so I figured, why not? Well now I know why not: because it's disgusting!  I like the decor, it's a really nice setting. The music was ok, the usual House thing. \u00a0The bartender was not really friendly with us; but he was super cool with the group of 3 girls next to us.  I really like their free cheese and crackers; that's a nice touch.  But the best thing about this is that it gave me an idea: I am going to make a Yelp list of mojitos in San Francisco, starting with this place. Every mojito I try now will be rated as follows:  - Taste: 2 stars. Tasted like a mojito, but no fruit flavor. - Appearance: 1 star. Awful muddling, no effort on presentation. - Price: 3 stars. 9 bucks, fair. - Bartender's name: didn't get it, but no biggie since there is nothing memorable about him, or his mojitos. - Overall: 1 star and a half mojito.",

Five years ago I used to stay on Divisidero and out of nowhere I've found myself back in places I haven't seen in years. Last night was one of those times.   I meandered in here with a few of my newer friends and was lured in by the promise of alcohol and cheese. Cheese? I thought. Well lo and behold, a few seconds after walking in, a huge basket full of crackers and four huge chunks of cheese sat before us. After taking in the cheese I observed my surroundings and realized that I had been there before but couldn't really remember a damn thing about the experience.  Damn shame to because this bar has this decor that could totally serve as the backdrop of a Tarentinoesque film. Reddish lighting, mirrors, funky seating and large lions posted about give it an interesting look. But of course, half of an experience is the company your with. I wound with some people I know from Polk. I realized we're like little gremlins. You know how there are a bunch of rules for gremlins like you can't get them wet or feed them after midnight? Yeah we need a set of rules. We're a bunch of little hooligans and descended upon the snacks. We had three hairdressers (read: creative types) and they turned a healthy portion of the shnacky offerings into pretty appetizers. It's what they do. The bartender on duty was nice enough to our gaggle of heathens even after one member whined about the lack of ranch dressing for the (free) carrot sticks. I really dug my lemon drop, too. The process to make each shot was time consuming and I later noticed other yummy looking drinks being sent out.  Hmm.....I foresee an update on this one later...",

Third was for the fruit drinks...OK, the fruit drinks are awesome as they're FRESH squeezed. Reminding me of the East Side Company Bar in New York (but about 2x its size) with its bartenders acting more like bar experts. Raspberry mojito was delish as well as my new favorite drink The Greyhound.   Friendly crowd of the mid-late twenties flock to this bar. Come in at 9 and the place is empty. Wait 45 minutes and you won't be able to move. Grab a table if you can and if you wait around long enough, someone will jump on the life size lion statue for photos :)",

I tip well, I'm friendly, I know what I want to order, and I order easy drinks... So there's no reason to be a dick to me.

But the gods of the first date smiled upon us, and as I parted the red sea of people, a small table for two appeared and we quickly claimed it - fortune favors the bold (or, in this case, the man with a few two many daquiri's in his system).  We shared a few drinks over thoughtful conversation, despite the boisterous ensemble of young people clamoring for attention all around us. And after a time, we left, and stepped into the quiet night to wait for an Uber. Hakuna Matata",

We met up with a group of college friends on a Friday night around 10:30 and were able to find seats right away. We did ask the staff to turn the fireplace off...probably great in winter but it was a really warm night.  As for drinks, I went with a $5.50 screwdriver because I need the rest of my ten dollar bill for the taxi home....too bad I couldn't get a mojito. Anyway, it was ok...for sure used cheap vodka (I didn't see the bottle but I know it was less than Smirnoff quality) but for $5.50 it was fine.",

There is a fire place and SO MUCH seating. \u00a0So it's great for groups for any sort of celebration. The bartenders are really friendly and make great drinks. \u00a0They have fresh fruit to squeeze and infuse and meddle into the best things you've ever tasted. \u00a0Drinks are about $8-$10 but the Quality makes them WORTH IT. \u00a0My favorites are the Lemon Drop Martinis with various fresh fruits and sugar on the rim (i like sweet) but they also make fantastic Mojitos (omg cucumber and/or basil?!) and Gimlets. \u00a0Drink names are fun and silly and once again, the bartenders love to describe them to you. Sometimes there is free cheese and crackers. It can get crowded Thursday-Saturday. Big Perk? They have a tiny TV but earned my heart for always playing the Giants games.",

Oh right, I'm in Pac Heights! :) Hhahaa...nonetheless, scores extra points on my Yummerz scale for that one!  Bartenders are cute..and more importantly friendly and can make some DRINKS! I dunno about the crowd, but I'm not there for them.   Did I mention that they've got an awesomely cozy fireplace? It's way dope!

Anyway, I don't really get it. \u00a0The place is set up with a a bunch of smaller tables to sit at, dim lighting for relaxing and having a good time with close friends. \u00a0I don't really see it as a kind of place where you go meet people... more of a place where you go and catch up with an old friend... which is what I was doing.  But for some reason, some guys still think it's okay to grind up behind me when I'm hugging my friend after not seeing her for a long time.  And then later when I'm VERY CLEARLY having a serious / private conversation with her, some other guys think it's okay to join in on our conversation that was, again, very clearly a private conversation.  Maybe I'm being a little tough because I was sober, but come on. \u00a0If I wanted to be hit on, I would've probably worn something more revealing and smiled more. \u00a0And probably go to a trashier place.  In light of all this, I really liked the staff and the bouncer. \u00a0They were all really sweet, and got my one drink pretty fast. \u00a0I ordered the Moscow Mule, which I thought was overpriced for the size and taste of it (a bit too sweet for me), but I would have liked to try some other drinks.  This place reminds me of a trashier version of Starlite in San Diego. \u00a0  I think this place would be great on a less busier night when people aren't so trashed or trashy. \u00a0The drinks / ambiance / set up here just don't really match with some of the crowd. \u00a0If you're going to get trashed, why are you getting trashed off of nice drinks? \u00a0Go take shots at a dive bar.",

It doesn't look like any of the girls who patronize the place actually eat anyway, so I guess they're in the clear. Anyway, if you can't afford to turn on your heat you could always go here; there are so many people packed into such a tight space you're sure to be warm.",

The Strawberry Mojito at this joint is made with fresh EVERYTHING, and you can taste just how awesome it is... They also make a mean-ass Greyhound, with freshly squeezed Grapefruit Juice--prices are a little high on the specialty drinks though.  I've heard stories about this place and the overwhelming amount of weekend douchebaggary, which leads me to believe if you want a decent time at this spot you should simply visit them during the week.

On this big mirror behind the bartenders juicing and muddling fresh herbs and fruit, they've written their own little drink menu in dry erase (I assume) markers. They have all their different mojitos and a list of shots and drop shots that YOU MUST TRY.   If I remember correctly, the Chuck Norris is the grossest one of all: a shot of bourbon dropped into a half pint of Bud Light. IS THIS LEGAL?   I did one once, but only after the bartender assured me that 2x in the past, patrons have tried to drink it and vomited back into the glass. But hey, I'm a risk taker like that.",

The drink was a tad bit too tart and I couldn't really taste the canteloupe.   Last but not least, let me talk about the bathroom...let's just say I felt like a lion in a cave! It was soooo dark and no light switch. It was a little akward and there were no toilet seat covers so of course i had to do the squat and in dark!!..so not cool.   All in all, I would go back someday to try the rest of their fresh fruit drinks. \u00a0= )",

First of all, it inhabits the ground floor of what appears to be an average Pac Hts. Victorian. It's on Divis, sure, but it's a couple blocks removed from the bustle of the Fishbowl, Tortilla Hts. and Solstice. So you wouldn't expect to find it here. Next, there's practically no signage. And finally, the windows are concealed by towering fronds and other mutant houseplants, so there's scant evidence that anyone even lives here, let alone operates a bar here.   The Lion is the perfect weeknight bar. It fills up, but it feels kind of underground having a drink there for some reason. The place is dark and wooden, with mirrored walls and dependable bartenders. It's one of those quintessentially local bars that don't make you feel like you're there just to say you're there or want you to feel like you're part of the \"in\" crowd. Such trivialities have no place at the Lion Pub. Just good drinks, good friends and an easy drunken stumble back to your bed after close.",

She was convinced we were going to barge in to someone's living room. Lion Pub has a tropical meets disco meets cozy feel to it. Weird description, I know, but this place rocks my socks.  Crowd seems to be rather eclectic- but certainly gets douchier as the weekend-night progresses. Bar tenders are friendly dudes who seem to really enjoy their jobs. (Except the one that has anger management issues- I'm not really sure what the exchange was between him and a customer, but it was not friendly.)  Drinks are reasonably priced ($6.50 for a Greyhound- and these are amazing here), $10 for a Raspberry Mojito. Love that everything is fresh squeezed!

So what I was told coming here was that this place has hand operate juice pumps and will extract a number of fresh fruits juices into our cocktails. \u00a0Now I did see that they had a number of beers on tap and a few other more traditional shots on the wall that you could order, but because it is something that they are known for I couldn't pass it up. \u00a0I was able to proudly order some of my fruit infused drinks from the bar with no weird looks and come back to table and enjoy them with no harassing comments from my friends. \u00a0  Grey hound - Started out with this one, vodka went down smooth with the fresh grapefruit. Screw hound - Similar to a greyhound, but in addition to the grapefruit they crush it a orange too... \u00a0Pretty tasty. Mojito - Fresh mint muddled and lime made for a good drink, could have used a little more lime... \u00a0 Pineapple blue berry mojito - This one was a little weird, I like blueberries and pineapples, just not together. Strawberry mango mojito - This one tasted like a meal, it was thick. \u00a0Very sweet. \u00a0But the mint worked well with it.  I am aware that these are fruity drinks, but I noticed if you have enough of it, you can still get pretty sloshed if you have enough of it. \u00a0Notice as time went on, I started fairly conservative and as night the wore on I progressed to sampling some of the other dirnks...  Only a few things of note that I didn't quite care for.  - Cash only and the ATM in the back charges you 2.25 to use it. \u00a0 - Getting orders at the bar is like the people on the floor trading stocks with the market crashing. \u00a0Pure chaos. - The staff that walk around can be dicks and take your drinks away before you've finished them. \u00a0Twice I was sitting there telling him I'm not finished and while hes looking at me he is stacking it in another cup. \u00a0Damn it man is there a shortage of cups?  Still despite these few hiccups, I love how there is no dress code, no cover and no lines, especially if you come early.  So next time you have that urge to have some fruity drinks, no need to make them secretly behind the doors of your home away from prying eyes and make you way to the Pacific Heights and give this bar a try. \u00a0Oh and btw, resist the temptation to straddle the Lion in the bar, they frown on that there...",

Met with the ladies and got a table next to some classic looking Pac Heights types (popped collars, sweater over the collared shirt, sideways Von Dutch hats, etc.). \u00a0We exchanged pleasantries when we first sat down and they kept it going (maybe b/c we were actually with women...who knows?), long story short one of these guys makes some unwanted sexual advances involving his balls and my friend's mouth. \u00a0This guy explained that it would be fun to take a picture and kept telling my friend to \"open his mouth\". \u00a0  Friend: \"Get back and get bent.\" Sideways Von Dutch hat looked sad and hurt by the remark.

Here's the kicker, here's why I'm never setting foot in this wretched establishment EVER again. \u00a0My friends and I tried to squash this problem many times, but sideways Von Dutch hat wouldn't drop it...eventually a bar back came by and was clearing our table, we asked him if he could say a few words to the bouncer b/c the gentleman behind us would not shut it. \u00a0He told us we were \"babies\" and needed to \"take it outside\". \u00a0  For a trendy, douche-infested bar in Pacific Heights, I was pretty shocked that this bartender wasn't THRILLED with us for alerting him of a potential violent scene erupting in his bar.  Instead, the bouncer comes over, and explains to US that we needed to \"stop talking shit\" and that he didn't have \"time to fucking babysit \" us.  So much for the good times we had with him on the way in.  We were getting ready to leave, when I saw the bouncer go over to sideways Von Dutch hat and give him some fist pound action...these guys were FRIENDS.  Just a terrible bar, with terrible food (even if it is free) full of terrible idiots (like sideways Von Dutch) who have connections with the staff that allow them to get away with acting like belligerent assholes.",

The mojitos and margaritas are where it's at if you head to Lion Pub. I suggest the pomegranate margarita, a bit stronger than the mojitos and in a cuter glass.   This place gets jam-packed and it can be difficult to grab a table. Keep your eye out for the tables by the ATM in the back (they are not bad). The bartenders are nice here and will do pretty much any drink no matter how ridic you try to make it. Shooters are fun too. Ladies always get served first!   SPECIAL NOTE: one of the bartenders charged my friend for an extra Magners accidentally and 20mins later when he realized it, he walked over to our table and handed my friend the cash that was wrongly charged. Honesty is always appreciated and what a great surprise to our night. What else to do but celebrate with another round of drinks!   Be prepared: CASH ONLY, but there is an ATM in the back.",

I love the strawberry mango mojito and all of the drinks with fresh fruit in them! A greyhound with fresh grapefruit juice? Wow! The cocktails are a little pricier than some other bars but you definitely get what you pay for here! You can always opt for a cheaper bottled beer if you need too also...  I love the jungle-like decor and the big table near the fireplace. I also enjoy the spread of (slightly stale) foods. It's probably pretty sketchy to eat spinach dip at a bar with tons of strangers, but that never seems to stop me... there is also often cheese and crackers, veggies, etc.   Lion Den is definitely gold: delicious cocktails, free food, fun crowd, and great decor!",

Those who are put off by the 20something Pac Hts crowd, as have been repeatedly discussed in other reviews, can find respite closer to the gas-lit fireplace. The table seating near there makes for better mood lighting and conversation, away from the din of the people getting soused at the bar. Better yet, come before 9 or 10pm, when they start filing in. But that also seems to be when the staff puts out the platters.  When the bar does get crowded, however, you will be pressed to get at those free platters.",

Most of the people I see in this place are too wasted to taste any difference there might be between a bottled mixer and fresh fruit. Still, as far as gimmicks go it's a good one...until you see the drink prices.   This place caters to the Marina/Pac Heights crowd. Get used to seeing both men and women wearing \"The Uniform\". Everyone looks the same, everyone talks the same, everyone acts the same. Be prepared for the \"whoooo!\" mating call of the drunk ex-fratboy in J-Crew every 20 minutes or so. Be prepared for the incessant click of the lip-smacking ex-sorority girl as well. It really is fascinating to see the mating calls of these two creatures in their native environment. I guess this place reminds me of a frat party for people who aren't in college anymore.   Drinks are on the pricey side and I was unimpressed with the ones I had. They have a snack spread that I wouldn't touch. Let me get this straight? I'm supposed to eat the smoked salmon that has been sitting on that table being picked over since 8pm? That's classy.   Everyone I know calls the place Lion's Den, but it doesn't really matter. You should not be drinking there. Many better places to drink exist in SF.   Go there instead.",

Never had a sign other than the stained glass lion. The crowd was always very well dressed and thoughtful of the neighbors. Someone once told me that the \"scene\" was older/younger but I never could tell for sure. It has been interesting to watch it transition to the place it is now. Still a nice crowd, just straight. The place is still beautifully kept.",

However, let me clear the air before you go off and say \"wait a second, why didn't he give it 5* if it's awesome?\" The only reason this place doesn't get 5 is because it's cash only -- and in my world, that's a major buzzkill.   I LOVE that I live within a 90 second walk of this place because it's a great default go-to with some friends if there's not much else going on.  My reasons for loving this place:  - The bouncers are friendly - The drinks are cheap yet strong -- $6 for the greyhound; $3 upsell to Grey Goose if that's how you roll - The bartenders aren't assholes and are very quick at noticing who needs to order - The free cheese and crackers are always fresh and tasty - Never had trouble with finding a place to sit - And finally, the douche-level of the patrons is just right. It's not quite Marina status, but definitely enough for me to feel right at home.",

The two best things about this place: 1) Cheese and crackers - and it's not just cheap cheese and crackers - it's a good variety of both that will keep you coming back for more 2) \u00a0A lion statue right when you walk in. \u00a0If you can get a picture on it without getting caught by the bar staff, then you're golden. \u00a0But be careful, they will definitely kick you out if they see you (yes, it's happened before!)  *TIPS -cash only!! \u00a0There's an ATM inside but bring cash ahead of time so you don't get charged the $3 service fee from the ATM and whatever your bank charges you for not using their ATMS -HAPPY HOUR is 4:30-7pm EVERYDAY! \u00a0We got there right at 7pm and missed happy hour prices. \u00a0Boo! \u00a0But now, I know!",

The owner (as I was told) had a nice spread of cheese, crackers, etc. on a large table so you could grab a drink and a little something to snack on as well. SUCH a nice touch! And as a few others have mentioned they make a delicious Greyhound!!! But any drink with fruit is awesome since they are all fresh squeezed...again a very nice touch.

The place is somewhat hidden. I didn't even know that it was a bar as you pass it. A friend said to meet there and i was like....i'm here, but i don't see it. Just listen for the music and wait til you see crowds outside on a friday or saturday night.   There is an unusual mix of fixtures on the inside though. Mostly bar furniture but there is an animal statue (....a bear? i can't remember). Looks like they found it somewhere and was like hey, that'd be perfect for the bar......really? i've yet to see anyone sit on it but I think it's random!  anyway, look for the chick waitress that gets hit on by a lot of drunk guys. tip her well and she'll reward you with FANTASTIC drinks. If you are looking for the frutiy girly drinks, she's your bartender.   If you are looking for those boring manly drinks she can do those too. If you order a jack &amp; coke or something similar, she gets a good mix and isn't heavy handed like some bars i've been to.   Nothing is worse than ordering a _____ (insert choice of alcohol) and _____ (insert juice/soda/energy drink, etc.) and getting 99% alcohol and a drop of juice. like i said, be sure to tip well and she'll treat you good.  don't be mean to the guy bartenders either, they aren't shy to hop the counter to box with asshole customers or break up a bar fight.",

After a few minutes my friend and I scored a couple of seats at the bar, where we ordered two more greyhounds from a different bartender, who was NOT as nice as the first one. He deliberately ignored my friend when she was trying to get his attention (Mind you, she is a very pretty and nice lady) And then finally, very impatiently took our order and my friend handed him $20. Our drinks (which were not as good as the first ones) finally arrived and after a moment we realized that we had not gotten our change back. My friend had to struggle to get his attention again and told him that he still owed us $5. Instead of trying to help us, he simply said, \"I didn't make your drinks,\" turned away and continued to ignore us until we finished our drinks and left. It was very rude and it really pissed me off because we hadn't done anything to deserve such treatment. All in all though, I'd like to visit this place again someday when it's not so busy, and try some of their other delightful sounding cocktails. Hopefully on a calmer night their drinks (and bartenders) are much better!",

I like that it doesn't really look like much from the outside. \u00a0Just an ivy covered front, no sign or anything. \u00a0It's kind of a weird set up - the bar feels really loooooong and narrow. \u00a0And it gets crowded. \u00a0Good luck finding a seat on a Friday or Saturday. \u00a0I can't say much about the crowd - I've never experienced any ridiculously douchey people while I was there - in general I feel that most San Franciscans act pretty douchey, but that may be a bit harsh.  I live in Las Vegas, where we can get free or extremely cheap drinks 24 hours a day. \u00a0And I didn't even blink an eye when I saw the prices at Lion Pub. \u00a0$10 is not crazy, folks. \u00a0They have an interesting selection of drinks that are made with super fresh ingredients. \u00a0In my opinion, they are well worth the cost. \u00a0The 1st time I was here, my friend Heather ordered a cantaloupe margarita that she literally could not finish because it was too strong. \u00a0I love the mojitos and the different concoctions they come up with - and I am usually strictly a beer girl. \u00a0The first time I was brought here, it was because I was told that they have the best greyhound in the city and that I absolutely must try it. \u00a0It didn't disappoint!  Parking is tough - but where in San Francisco isn't it? \u00a0Take a cab and quit your bitchin!  The fireplace is amazing. \u00a0And the music has also always been on point. \u00a0Also - I have been here past \"last call\" quite a few times. I've even arrived to the bar and been served a drink at almost 1:30am. That is unheard of for California! \u00a0This is a place that I always make sure I stop at when I am in town",

I like this place and I'll be back. \u00a0It's just a weird atmosphere. \u00a0Check it out though!",

It somehow manages to pull off being both an upscale and comfortable neighborhood bar, like where interior decorators might meet their business owner friends after a long day to kick up their well-heeled heels and have a stiff drink. \u00a0My kind of place!\n  The fruit mojitos are delicious and divine. \u00a0And I am not usually one to support a drink that deviates too much from the original - but these are not to be missed. \u00a0 The fresh fruit is muddled in the glass along with the mint, so the flavor is distributed throughout. \u00a0 We knocked back 3 different varieties: \u00a0Strawberry Mango, Blueberry Pineapple, and Cantaloupe Pomegranate. \u00a0YUM. \u00a0They go down easy, and they're only $8.00, so pace yourself.\n  The bartender was very nice and accommodated my request to play a certain Tosca track that I love and they had on their rotation. \u00a0It's not even my neighborhood and I felt like I was being treated like a regular. \u00a0Nice.\n  My review is only based on one visit, on a Friday evening, so I cannot comment on the crowds or different experiences on different days/nights. \u00a0But how about I go back an few times and check it out, just for the sake of accuracy and consistency. \u00a0It's no problem, really.

Yeah, it's yummy, pulpy goodness, but with this little breathing room it's difficult to fully appreciate it.

You've gotta try it. The other fruity drinks ordered were very good as well, fresh.  Worst thing: Crowded with people, couldn't get in the door at first because of people standing and smoking literally right in front of the door, couldn't get to the bar, couldn't find a place to stand (forget about sit).. which was awkward. The music was kinda fun but not good enough to dance to.  I got the distinct impression that everyone there was either still in college or trying to act like they were. A bit of a strange experience.  So, go, but only for drinks. Then spend your night somewhere else.",

My friends took me here the night of my 21st birthday and I was officially introduced to the best mojitos ever and a cute little bar.  While Lions Pub is a little out of the way for me, I will definitely go there if I want a freshly made mojito. The bartenders really take their time making them and only use fresh ingredients. The regular mojito and strawberry mojito are amazing. YUM. They also have a table set up by the bar with different kinds of cheese and crackers. Double YUM.  They also play some pretty good music and I love the decor - its fun to watch people sit and take pictures with the lions, heh.   It does get crowded so get here a little early to get a table.",

Wait, I can't tell if the flowers smell, because I'm overwhelmed by the aroma of mint, staple of that mojito drink all the cool kids reportedly partake of. Mint smells fresh, so once I settled in, I felt as clean and crisp as freshly ground spices despite the fact that I had been drinking since the middle of the afternoon and had just come off of Muni. Hester's blueberry and pineapple concoction definitely had a whiff of the healthy, so I stuck to my boyfriend, Jack Daniels. Unfortunately, my man cost me a disproportionate amount to the volume of him in my glass. But I guess that's what happens when your boyfriends come in bottles.",

I had seen fellow 'Friscan friends order a drink referred to as a Greyhound (grapefruit juice + vodka) and thought it was a little odd...until I was given one here. The grapefruit juice is perfectly sweet/tart and fresh - a drink I adored here but would never order at home again in Melbourne. Which for me was kind of perfect for my trip here. I do love to adopt local culture in cities I visit and step outside my home life.   My friends and I sat at the bar and were able to hear each other audibly, having a good time and enjoying nice drinks. The service was a tad lax at times, but overall we had a really great time and were far from disappointed with our drink orders.  I'd come back again, 100%.

All our drinks were about $9 each, which was a score considering how yummy they were. I also spotted a li hing margarita on the menu, which I'm totally intrigued by. I love li hing dried mango, but not sure about a li hing cocktail. Someone please tell me if this is a green light!  In terms of personas, there seems to be a high number of man-packs that frequent this bar. As in, lots of dudes. I read in another review that these are \"OC rejects\" but in my eyes, I would say typical San Franciscans. A colorful mix of normal, bad, and just plain weird outfits on a wide range of body types.

Ok this syllogism was not funny, unlike some of the ones yelpers came up with. \u00a0But I think you get my main point. \u00a0Go on a weeknight, or earlier on the weekend. \u00a0Get a drink made with fresh squeezed juice and chill by the fire.",

To me, this place walks the line almost perfectly. Its non-descript exterior and its low lights and jungle type foliage inside combine with numerous nooks and corners that not only allow semi-privacy but possible eating of their free hor de'vors without catching an elbow from a passing patron.  The drinks are tasty too--they use fresh juices when they can, squeezing them in front of you when you order, which makes their greyhounds worth twice what they charge (I remember them being rather reasonably priced). I must had consumed 6 my last visit and it was the drink to have of the lot. Service is friendly and prompt without being overbearing and impatient.   Overall a great experience and well recommended. \u00a0I have been a number of times, going back because of how much I enjoy it. The non-perfect score is for the bathrooms, which can be a disaster. I am not one to complain, typically, but they are out-dated and overused. This was likely due to a rather large Friday crowd, when they come.",

So yes when it's busy, expect that it will take your poor bartender a bit longer to make your drink. I mean, you will see him mash an orange or even some raspberries or something! But remember, it's for your benefit. \u00a0It's nectar from the Gods.  The prices are on point. It gets super crowded after 8 or so on weekends. The kind of crowded where the guy at the door can't even open it without hitting someone standing just inside. And yes, you will get the DBag Marina dudes with button downs of course. But who cares. Ignore them and deal with it. It's not as bad as say, Balboa Cafe.  Stop by. Sooooooo worth it. Bring an out of towner and you will inevitably hear....\"GOD, I LOVE San Francisco!

The rest, nominally male, can reasonably be expected to exhibit at least one of the following traits:  A) skilled mixologist  B) charismatic raconteur C) so good-looking and magnetic I turn on a heel (saying \"eep\") and leave as I know I will be invisible to all potential lady loves within his immediate hot zone D) better looking than meself at the barest minimum  Let's see, our fella yesterday was a remedial mixologist (mojito, check! he makes with it tonic water...huh!?!), a mid-level grump, had reverse magnetism and the grown-out remains of a prison haircut. All kitted out in laundry day togs. That said, his immediate replacement was a looker AND a skilled bartendress. Two in my group each picked a bartender with the lovely night shift braumaiden mixing Yelper X a fine, friendly drink as Yelper Y waited with her teeth in her mouth for guytender to notice her that she might order a Manhattan that he could put ginger ale in. And Yelper Y was a cute chick fer fooks seck! \u00a0  And know ye this, if I can't be plied with honeyed words, inexpensive drinks or red lipstick on a near-sighted girl who snorts a little when she laughs, laying out a platter of various cheeses is the easiest way to get me to shill for you. Lion Pub did this. About a yard and a half of cheeses. Yet still I whinge about their inequities.  As Agent J's Law Of Saloon Douchery begins to takes effect (wherein, if you're not starting to fall in love with a bar during a Friday happy hour, by 9:30 you'll want the joint to have a single, collective hinder with your funky feet kicking it like Bob Fosse) I try to step outside for a breather. Packed ass to nuts, I can barely squeeze my way to the door. One gigantic douche ignores my \"excuse me\" AND my \"beg pardon\", both uttered with the civility of Bugs Bunny at the cinema. So I pass him, without a body check, but one needed to pass and he clearly wasn't The Quality. He turns and gives me that incredulous look that greazy haired yuppie fleas like him always do when ired. The one that says, \"Brah, WTF?\" and has all the legitimacy of OJ pretending the gloves are tight. To his wordless protest I said \"I excused myself and begged your pardon. Dude.\" Somehow this rattled the ox and he stepped aside.   I won't be back soon, as it was not my kind of joint at all. Subjectively, I freely admit. Bog-Standard drinks, rather pricey. The nail-bound ladies. The above ox and his brethren, in no short supply. Whitey. But that was some mighty fine cheese.",

G Bar has cheese as well, but really gross, hard squares that I'll only touch if my liquid dinner needs supplementing to prevent me from falling on my face. And Sugar Lounge has free warm food, but it's all pretty gelatinous. Lion Pub acts like they're throwing a nice cocktail party for friends every night! \n  I had my 30th birthday party here and it was perfect. They let my DJ friends spin until the cops made us take it down a notch. The only thing keeping my review from 5 stars is that the neighbors really keep the place in check, noise-wise. I'm sure listening to music and conversations of smokers outside isn't fun, but it does make you feel like a high school kid at a busted party every time the cops show up. \n  I've been back recently just for happy hour and finally tried their greyhound with fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and letmetellyou it is a downright refreshing way to start the weekend.",

It's a nice enough bar, they have Stella on tap and the fruit mojitos are good. \u00a0 I get nervous eating the snacks that have been out all night with people touching every piece so I usually don't partake in that activity. \u00a0I normally enjoy the fire place, but with a bazillion people in there you really don't need the additional heat.

Each side of decoration is unique, they might not blend well, but then you don't circle around as you drink.  and of course... the cheese and crackers... always helps my drinks.

Some could be misbehaving, but there are always those people once in a while. But nevertheless, your eyes will be pleased more often than not.   But, music could be hard to hear, and often not so impressive.

It's a great place to bring a decent group of people for an after-work drink, as I recently did. Would it be a place that I return to often? Probably not, and that's based on the crowd that it attracts (being closed to Pac Heights, and all.) \u00a0I was surprised at the music being played (assumed it was a bartender's iPod) as it definitely had a gay twist on it.

They had shots for $7 that were basically a full shot of alcohol plus about two-thirds of a beer that you drop the shot into and chug the whole thing. \u00a0So you're pretty much chugging a beer and a shot at once. \u00a0Oh yeah, that sounds totally responsible to me. \u00a0give the designated driver two!   Anyway, I was in my own crowd there so I can't speak for the attractiveness of the other attendees. \u00a0passing glances were that they were acceptable without being knock over gorgeous people. \u00a0Seemed pretty lily white which is rare in the non-marina bars that I've been to. \u00a0So if you're into the young and caucasion and you're anxious to get with the wasted crowd then head over. \u00a0I will give it high marks for the d\u00e9cor and overall execution of what they are trying to do. \u00a0The location must be hard to attract people to but they've done a good job of creating an environment that brings in the young and lovelies.",

My big grievance is the bartenders. \u00a0What a bunch of putzes. \u00a0These guys ignore everybody they aren't hoping to sleep with, have minimal bartending skills, and are just generally slower than shit. \u00a0I lucked out on the second round and was able to order immediately, but twice it took almost ten minutes when they weren't busy and there were four or five guys working behind the bar. \u00a0At one point, a couple went to the bar to grab drinks and were gone so long that we thought they left.  Apparently, this place used to be a popular gay bar, still reflected in the mixed drink specials, but the straights overwhelmed the place and it seems to be a pretty heterogeneously hetero place. \u00a0I saw a mid-thirties male couple go inside and cruise back out within 25 seconds. \u00a0I'm guessing they hadn't been there in a while and it wasn't at all what they remembered.  So yeah, it's a nice spot to go with a group and the drinks are reasonable, but order in bulk because it will take you a while to get another round.",

Music selection spinning through the airways was that of Top 40 and 80's-90's tunes you'd hear at a friend, of a friend's wedding. Downright just bad. This also seems to be the place if you're looking for that special someone for a brief relationship that only lasts until the next morning.

Most recently you introduced me to another friend, Burt Reynolds, which I cannot stop ordering to make sure everyone I know tries it!  Don't like the crowds?

I felt like I was in the Haunted House at Disneyland but not in a magical way and not in a creepy way... just a sort of cheesy way. I'm sure the scene varies but I think it was high school night when I went. I did get a free beer with my shot of tequila and they had my favorite... tequila, that is. I get free beer where I work so there's no real need to ever go back to Lion. Been there, done that. But don't let my review sway you. You might like this place.",

The place is shaped like a fairly thin but long rectangle. The actual bar takes up about half the space and the other half is filled with tables. Last night (Saturday) was my first time there and honestly, I was impressed with the female talent - some really good looking girls. They have some neon lights and awkward lighting but the crowd is pretty cool. Make sure to snag up a table if you see one. It's way better to be sitting!   Drinks:  Your standard bar. The one drink I had was fairly strong which I like. I appreciate a bartender with a heavy hand - more bang for your bucks. They were decently priced too. I bought me and my buddies the first round of drinks, total of 5 cocktails - it came out to be $32.   Music:  Top 40s. Pop, hip hop. Nothing special even though I oddly did feel like dancing at this place.   Clientele:   Younger, mid 20s to early 30s. Cute girls with style. Guys are the same you see anywhere else in the city.   Not my favorite place but go check it out. It's not bad at all especially if you're kicking it with your friends.",

Nice touch! Good selection of beers and cool ambiance. Also the place was buzzing with quite a few people.  Now why only 3 stars, well on a Friday night at 7:30pm, there were a lot of people there and only one bartender and not even a barback. The dude was slammed and working his ass off. However, it took a long time to get drinks and the seating area and bar were littered with glasses.  At 9pm two more people came in to help but I felt bad for the guy for that 1.5 hours that I was there.  I'll be back when I'm in the neighborhood because it's as good as it gets on Divisadero.",

That said, it's a great bar. \u00a0The space is cozy and I love that the cocktails are all made with fresh juice, not to mention the snack display. \u00a0For anyone who knows me, free cheese is a surefire way to make me swoon. \u00a0Make sure you're there early when it's fresh, since I know I don't have to explain the state of various cheeses, dips and salmon after several hours of being picked over in a hot and crowded bar. \u00a0Squick. Service can be a bit spotty --- I was in with a gentleman caller one evening and we were the only ones in there aside from the bartender's group of friends. \u00a0We didn't get much service outta him even though we sat AT the bar, which is a shame since if you have ever had the pulpified watermelon and vodka? \u00a0Jeebus they go down quickly. \u00a0He could've made twice the money off of us if he was just a tad more aware that we were actually still there.

What? Yeah, I have no clue.  I like this place but the one thing I don't like is the fact that it's CASH ONLY.
