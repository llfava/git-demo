We both got the Louie salad with lettuce, avacado, egg, shrimp and crab on top. \u00a0Dressing on the side was more of a thousand island. \u00a0The salad was very good.

But I like this place because out of the hundreds and hundreds of clubs, bars and lounges in San Francisco, Pier 23 is one of only a few that feature live reggae music all night. There's no place quite like it, I mean really, what other club, bar or lounge can you go to in San Francisco and see people passin' the dutchie to the left hand side? Yes, people were smokin' fatties like it was legal. Good thing there is an outdoor area in the back or else we all would have suffered from secondhand smoke and came out high as a kite!   May I give you a few suggestions before coming to Pier 23? You might want to get your drinks in beforehand because the bar inside is always packed and it tends to get very hot in there, which makes waiting in line for a drink like one hot, smelly day in hell. There is a diner across the street (Fog City Diner) that has a full bar where its easy to grab a few seats, have some drinks and go.   For shows, there is usually a $10 cover at the door (can increase to $15 after 11pm), but whenever there is a special performance, don't even try to get in the long line outside. Tickets are sold in advance either at Pier 23 or on the website. There is no dress code which is great. One drawback is that there are no ins &amp; outs.   So other than the fact that it gets crowded and hot, and beside the fact that people smoke weed inside (which can be a good or bad thing for some of you people), Pier 23 is a cool spot to hang out and listen to some good live reggae music.",

I thought that at a venue as busy as this it was gone for sure. Finally I decided to call there to see if by chance it was there. I spoke with the owner Flicka McGurrin who had informed me that she did find a phone, but drilled me to be sure it was mine. Which was just great to know she really wanted to make sure it got back to the proper owner. Well Flicka, yes it did and i want to Thank you!",

We had a reservation so I thankfully sat out back at a nice big table for five. Drinks were ordered..... They were great. \u00a0Love their bloodies. \u00a0 But the bread didn't come. \u00a0We asked three people...it came AFTER the appetizers. \u00a0We ordered appetizers....shrimp cocktail and oysters. \u00a0These were not brought to the table for at least 2o...25 minutes. Two cold items should not take this long. \u00a0Not only that but, the shrimp turned out to be bay shrimp ....not the nice prawns I have been served in the past......HUGE disappointment. Another big bummer......NO whole crab. \u00a0She even told us ....'oh it's not crab season yet....' \u00a0I said ....'yes it is..... It's a week old!' \u00a0 She then back peddled and said that this is what they say......and really they just ran out on Friday. \u00a0 They offered Alaskan king crab legs baked?.! \u00a0NoT!!!! Our food was good. \u00a0The fish was tiny for fish n chips though. \u00a0I have also ordered the crab/shrimp Sammy in the past.....it was grilled.....but, not today, \u00a0they don't do this any more. \u00a0The bread is yummy though so it was good too. \u00a0 We were really sad about the crab.....but we were hungry so, we stayed. \u00a0But I still want crab darn it! \u00a0My friend and my dad both had clapping.......it's red sauce now! \u00a0Good to see that:)",

    "review_text": "A great outdoor location to enjoy the bay view (as in the water, not that hood no one wants to go to and surely wouldn't be eating al fresco if ventured). \u00a0Large beer, wine and cocktail selection to make the scenery even more enjoyable. \u00a0The food seemed uneven despite the promise of a new chef that overhauled the menu. \u00a0Probably won't get anything as good here as at Pier 5, Pier 3, Pier 1.5 or the Ferry Building. \u00a0Might be some gems hidden in the menu, but I wasn't lucky enough to discover them.  Clam Chowder: Creamy, thick and huge chunks of clams. \u00a0Not terribly complex, but definitely comforting. \u00a0I really enjoyed the oversized crostini smeared with minced garlic as an alternative to overdone oyster crackers or saltines.  Crab &amp; Shrimp Louie: I was excited about this dish because it's an old school San Francisco original and this joint looked pretty old school. \u00a0Sadly, only the crab and the dressing seemed to fit the traditional Crab Louie profile. \u00a0They used peasant quality iceberg lettuce instead of romaine. \u00a0 No asparagus, tomatoes or cucumbers. \u00a0The shrimp actually detracted from the dish since they were the micro, limp cheap bay shrimp variety as opposed to something nice and hearty.   Mac, Bac &amp; Cheese: I need to spread some mac hateration here. \u00a0No redeeming qualities. \u00a0The elbows were overcooked and soggy. \u00a0The cheese was bland and in short supply. \u00a0There were no bits of crusty/crumbly topping. \u00a0The bacon was in small bits, barely declaring a presence.  Linguine with Crab Sauce: This is the dish that saved this joint from dropping one star lower. \u00a0I was worried about the term \"crab sauce\", but was pleasantly surprised by nice large pieces of crab instead of those crab flecks some places like to try and pass off. \u00a0Hearty linguine with a complex tomato, tarragon and cream sauce. \u00a0Proves that placing large fresh crab chunks in any entr\u00e9e can real improve it.",

Pier 23 is right on the water with a great view of the bridge, the bay, and Coit Tower. It's also a great location for taking a walk down the embarcadero after a delicious meal!   This place is just the right amount of funky and divey. It's authentic and refreshing and you won't find anything else like it!

You may pass it by everyday not giving it a second thought. I thought the same thing until I stepped inside out of the cold into the warm, small bar area.   The bar is nice and inviting with quaint theming. They had a Blues/Jazz trio playing that night and they were great! I play in couple bands myself and I really enjoyed the groove these guys had going.  We made our way past the bar to a small outside patio that is enclosed and shielded from the elements with see through plastic tarp. A bit odd at first, but once we were seated it was easy to get used to. They had heaters blazing so it wasn't long before I took my coat off and was nice and cozy. The patio offers some nice views of the Bay and on a hot summer night I imagine they dial back the enclosures.  For drinks I ordered the spice island mojito which was flavorful and tart. For food I ordered the crab &amp; shrimp sandwich. My brothers both ordered the whole Dungeness crab and my mom ordered the crab &amp; Shrimp as well.  The food came fast, our server was quick and attentive. My sandwich was fantastic! It also came with seasoned fries that amazing. I helped my brothers finish their crab which came cooked and cleaned with a nice broth in the empty shell for dipping. The crab was amazing, just perfectly seasoned and sweet. The broth was great as well.  This is not the cheapest place in town but great seafood comes at a price these days.

I don't know WHAT we were thinking... but on the show the food looked so good! \u00a0(We are locals - not tourists- so we really have no excuse here...)   We ordered fried calamari (average), fish tacos (meh, nothing special), and the crab shrimp sandwich. It was gross and a complete waste of my $17.50. It looked like some sort of a salad, with shredded 'crab' and tiny shrimp. It was drowning in mayo and the sandwich tasted like lemon. Only lemon. I couldn't take more than two bites -- it was that bad. The beer was good - but it is hard to mess up blue moon in a bottle.  This would be a great place to go for beers / happy hour. The location is right on the San Francisco Bay and the restaurant has a nice outdoor area. The view is perfect. Just skip it for dinner. Prices are high for what is essentially not very good bar food.",

    "review_text": "I created my Yelp account because of this place.  I've gone to Pier 23 Cafe twice now, and I will not go back again.   Trip 1: The first time was after a Giants game, around sunset. The place was quite crowded, and I had to act like a vulture and try to track down chairs to take away from tables as people would get up. For the first half of the meal some of us had stools from other tables that were too high for our table. The service was nothing special or bad - just what you would hope for. The food was OK at best on this trip, but I didn't order anything too complicated (fish &amp; chips and clam chowder). The food was overpriced though. Our group sat outside and an obviously drunk guy two tables away, over the course of about 10 minutes, chucked his empty glasses of beer, plates, utensils, etc into the Bay from his seat - and he wasn't exactly sitting near the water. Somehow, the people working there either missed this or just didn't care.   Trip 2: A buddy of mine and I went there to grab a late afternoon bite to eat. The place was not busy at all and we were seated in about 5 minutes in the smallest table in the place. The table could barely fit one meal and a drink on it if we tried. A bigger table, happened to open up next to us after a couple got up to leave, and I asked the waitress if we could move tables. She said no problem and sat us at a table made for 4. After waiting about 10 minutes the waitress finally came back and took our drink orders. Before the drinks were brought to us, the hostess comes up to us and makes us move tables because we are a group of 2 sitting at a 4 person table. I thought it was ironic since two people were just sitting there before us, but we went along with it.   Without going into too much boring detail, the server was as slow as you can be and was quite inattentive (never asked how we were doing, water glasses were not filled unless asked, etc.). For the meal we got nachos and clam chowder for appetizers and chicken breast sandwich and fries for the entree. The nachos were AWFUL and overpriced. The nachos at any ballpark taste better, and I'm pretty sure they use the same liquid cheese. How can you not use real cheese on restaurant nachos? The clam chowder was good, but nothing special. The chicken breast sandwich and fries were not bad, but it too was overpriced. While serving the entree, the bus boy dropped a plate and some sauces on my buddy. It turned out to be less of a mess only because we both caught some of the flying debris in midair. I made the joke to my buddy, well we have everything we need - no way this get worse. A minute later, the person at the table next to us starts to smoke. The staff there did nothing about it, and let her smoke.   Once our meal from hell was over, we just wanted to leave. We had been done with our meal for a good 20 minutes before we ever saw our server, and had to flag her down to get the check. I got the check, and guess what, apparently soda refills aren't free.   Oh, and by the way, parking is a hassle. Mark this place down as not a place to visit.",

Presentation was great, service very good.  Today, not the same experience. \u00a0After a long day of sitting through lectures at the dental convention, I was craving nothing but Pier 23. Greeter wasn't the friendliest, but \"Eh\", whatever. When I was ready to order, I told the server what I wanted (their version of a Reuben, the Corned Beef on Sourdough). I was going to ask about also getting a few oysters on the half shell, but she darted off before I had a chance, right after I finished saying the sandwich I wanted! So much for add-on sales, to add to her tip also!  After having been blown away by last visit, I was disappointed in this one. The presentation was boring... the sandwich on a wood plank with a pickle on the side. No greens, no fries. The flavor was good, but the corned beef a fattier than I'd have liked. I had to pick a lot of it off. I was still wanting to get the oysters, and had decided I'd like to add a beer also, but since my server NEVER ONCE came to check on me while I was eating, that never happened. I had ordered iced tea. No checking to see if I needed another. No refills to my water glass. I felt completely &amp; totally ignored.   Another solo female diner to my left seemed to also be less attended to than, say, the male solo diners that were seated to my right. They were all asked if they wanted more beers, checked on, an offer to put the bib on the diner who'd ordered roasted crab. I left a 22% tip because that's just who I am, but hated to leave anything, given the utter neglect I was shown. Just think... if the server had done her job, I'd have probably ordered at least another $15 in food/drink, and probably another $5 in her pocket. Given my observations, however, only her male customers ordering crab and Oysters Rockefeller, as well as beers from the get-go were worthy of her attention.   If you don't care for seafood, and love corned beef, get the \"Reuben\". It was good, their house-made sauerkraut less tangy than the purchased versions usually used. If you're on the fence, go with the seafood. I should have. At least then I would have been happier with my food as I was being ignored &amp; treated as if my $ wasn't as good as my male counterparts'. Ladies, if dining solo, I wish for you to be treated as if your hard-earned money was as good as your male co-diners.",

I explained that I was from out-of-town and she invited me to send them the bill.   After returning home, I had the suit dry cleaned. I emailed an image of the card and receipt to the restaurant, fully expecting them to ignore the entire matter. Instead, I received a check in the mail less than a week later with a note of apology.   To me, any restaurant who owns their mistakes and follows through with integrity is worth my recommendation.

    "review_text": "Another Triple D spot that Guy was able to convince me to try. I came to Pier 23 with my friend for lunch on one of the most beautiful days in San Francisco since I've been here. Pier 23 is right on the water, but unlike most places in that area, gives a bit of more of a locals feel, though I'm sure a lot of tourists check it out too.   It was a Friday afternoon and it was pretty busy, but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. We grabbed seats at the bar to have a drink while we waited and the bartender immediately greeted us with high fives (lol). I unfortunately cannot remember his name but he was awesome. I ordered a pino grigio, which came in a water glass...odd but I didn't really mind.   We then were seated at a table directly on the water with a gorgeous view of the bay. Our server greeted us promptly and was also really awesome (can't remember her name either, dammit). We ordered the cheese plate to start, which came with grilled garlic cloves, almonds, and honey. It was a good app - but it doesn't really take much effort or culinary expertise to make a cheese plate. I was between the seafood louie or the fish tacos, so our server helped me decide by recommending the tacos, which I discovered were snapper. They were really just eh. Having lived in Florida for 5 years, I have had some really amazing fish tacos, but these just didn't compare. The sauce they came with definitely added great flavor though and they were not horrible by any means. My friend had the clam chowder and a caesar salad and seemed happy with them.  If I was basing my review on food alone, Pier 23 Cafe would probably get 2.5-3 stars. However the view, ambience, and service boosted me to 4 stars. Well, let's say 3.8.",

After putting our names down for a 45 minute wait, no big deal, we went and sat outside in the sun with a couple of beers. This was the best part of our time there.   An hour and a half later we had not heard from the front so I went back inside and they had forgotten to call. After many apologies we were seated only to then be told that there was no crab, the one thing that we had come for.   The 5 flavor chip dip was very good but not what we were hoping for. Also the staff was very slow and seemingly uninterested. Overall just not a great vibe about the place.   Might try it again someday but I wouldn't come back for the food.

I tried the Sangre Peligroso, which came with Peligroso Silver Tequila, solerno blood orange liqueur, lime, and a chile salt rim. This was a strong drink, but it was tasty. The chile rim gave the drink an extra kick.   After one or two of the Sangre Peligroso, I decided to switch over to the Sally Rand. Served with Ketel One Vodka, pear liqueur, ginger, and fresh lemon.

And just as expected, the P23 Benedict was amazing!!! \u00a0All, if not most, Eggs Benedicts that I've had look really delicious and this one was no exception (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ONVp7PwdRb8BKQE5OTqPSA&amp;userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026</a>). \u00a0Made up of Crab &amp; Shrimp cakes, Poached Eggs, covered with Roasted Poblano Hollandaise. \u00a0Nothing but the good stuff! \u00a0It also came with mixed greens and fried potatoes which had a nice spicy kick to them.  I would say that Pier 23 is a little down the middle when comes to Tourist Attraction and Local Joint since it's like a small diner on The Embarcadero where you'll find a diverse combination of locals and tourists. \u00a0It's not something that first comes to mind when you mention San Francisco, but they did get a lot of exposure with their Food Network spot. \u00a0Great food and great atmosphere (especially if you can land a table on their back patio). \u00a0I would definitely come back here again in the future.",

    "review_text": "Pier 23 is a bar and restaurant located along the San Francisco Embarcadero. It's a welcome oasis between the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf - each 1 mile away. The location is excellent. In the Bar and front seating area you can watch the parade of people go by on the Embarcadero. The back seating area is large and has great view of the water. There is even a side beer garden area that's also a smoking section.  After that, this place moves to a mediocre rating. There is jazz music on various nights. The place is small and they use incredibly large speakers, which make talking impossible. Which would be okay if there was another activity like dancing, but no.  The food is okay. Some dishes are good, others are not. Nothing is steller. The burger and seafood sandwich are good. The steak sandwich varies from tender to tough. The clam chowder is thin and not very tasty. The oysters are okay - a good deal when on happy hour. I live 3 blocks away and have been to this place many times trying to make it my local. I never see the same bartender twice. They give adequate service - not chatty or engaging, but okay. Final word = This is a great place for tourist. If you know someone who works there, they are clearly allowed to spend time with you over their other customers. For locals, there are plenty of other places in SF I would rather be at. Once I move out of the neighborhood, I will not return.",

After 15 minutes a girl named Kara came outside and told us to leave because they were too busy. We were really insulted! For a business on the water and on the busiest road in San Francisco, they should be prepared for busy days. They even explained that they were busy because of football season, even more of a reason to be over staffed, than under staffed. For a restaurant that has been featured on the Food Network I would expect a lot more.  Horrible experience and would not recommend this place!

The resto is a no-frills, clean, casual spot to grab grub. The view from the patio overlooking the water isn't too shabby, either.  Being that Pier 23 is located in SF, along the Embarcadero, it's usually pretty chilly. The eats we ordered were pretty comforting.  -Clam chowder bowl ($4). This was the perfect choice as a starter. Not only was it warm and delicious, but the toasted sourdough bread on top added the perfect touch.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3f3mowACWFovTKv0YlcMgQ?select=3IbYVCiGlBBEzJze2MZGSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/3f3m\u2026</a>  -Fish and chips ($13.50). The fish was meaty and fresh. I would only expect fresh seafood from the Pier. The coleslaw w/ jalapeno dressing was delish, as well as the nicely seasoned string fries. I double dipped in the aioli sauce and then in the malt vinegar.

Having found a parking spot right on the Embarcadero across from Pier 23, I thought was a good omen. My first clue that this may not be the case, was when the parking meter (now needing to be fed on Sunday) charged $2.50 per hour. Nonetheless, since it was such a nice afternoon, my girlfriend and I decided to pay tribute to the meter and cross the street to Pier 23.  We walked in and found two seats at the bar (which was not crowded at the time). Although there were two bartenders, service was a bit slow. Finally getting one bartender's attention we ordered a Virgin Mary and a Diet Coke. We then asked for a menu and my girlfriend asked for a glass of water. Bartender 1 delivered the menu and the glass of water along with a comment, \" You sure ask for a lot.\" I took the offhanded remark as simply a poor attempt at sarcastic humor.  After perusing the menu, we decided to order. Keeping in mind that the bar is not crowded, that there were two bartenders and that there is less than three feet between me and the bartenders, this should have been a simple task. Not so.  I attempted to get Bartender 1 who served us to take our food order. I said \"Excuse me!\" not once but three or four times --- nothing. I waved and pointed to the menu, indicating that we were ready to order ---- nothing. I stood higher up on the bar stool to gain attention --- Bartender2 saw me and indicated he'd be right over, but as soon as I sat back down he went to the opposite side of the bar. Bartender 1 although there, was mute and kept his back to me.   Finally, I said to my girlfriend that I didn't enjoy having to beg for service so we decided to leave. I then asked for the check saying, \"I'd like to settle up.\" NOTHING. So I said it again. Bartender 1 still with his back to me remained mute. Bartender 2 saw me and said, \" I don't know what you had.\" Why he didn't bother to ask Bartender 1 who was less than two feet from him I don't know. I said, \" A Virgin Mary and a Diet Coke.\" Bartender 2 said, \" Oh, twenty bucks!\" Incredulously I replied, \"What? Are you kidding?\" At this point I was angry and I showed it. Bartender 2 then said, \"Ok. Forget it. It's on the house.\"  We then walked out, NEVER TO RETURN!!!",

When it's warm out, the patio and beer garden are great spots... but it can be really cold when the weather gets San Francisco-y. \u00a0Also, watch out for dive bombing pidgeons. No joke, at least 2 knocked me in the head and a few went after the food on my surrounding diners' tables. The service was slow and didn't go above and beyond taking my order and bringing me my food. Never came to check on us. Since I learned that wait staff in SF makes SF minimum wage ($10) because CA doesn't have a tip credit plus their tips, I have gotten very critical about the service I receive there. No more automatic 15% and 20-25% for good service, 20% will be reserved for great service. The clam chowder was okay but the piece of toasted sourdough they gave me was very thin and the soup was cold. The bacon wrapped oysters were fried (didn't say they were fried on the menu) but we're pretty good. They came with a yummy apple and watercress salad. Skip the field greens salad with champagne vinaigrette. For $7 it was way too small and lacking dressing. The mussels/ clams were extremely good and came with 4 pieces of sourdough as well as one that was already in the broth. It was a huge serving (as it should be for $17) and really great.",

When I was a young pup working for slave wages as a media planner in a nearby ad agency, me and the rest of the demotivated concubines used to come here after work for pitchers and burgers. In the intervening years, I would come back for the occasional get-together usually for reunions of some sort. But I don't think I had been back for the last decade until Jamie W. and I decided to drop by with the return of Sunday Streets on the Embarcadero.  The sun came out for us, but it was still a bit nippy. Consequently, we were seated in the patio area under a plastic tent with see-through vinyl windows in order to savor the bay views. As we watched the tankers crawl by in the distance, we both recognized the menu looked well-geared toward the ignorant tourist trade, especially among the ones who were challenged by the concept of foreign currency exchange since the prices were on the furrowed brow side.  We were both drawn to the $6 Bac, Mac &amp; Cheese side dish and decided to share one order (see photo). Both of us liked the mac part, and the gooey cheese was certainly not a source of complaint. But the bacon bits were charred beyond being edible and severely compromised a promising serving of comfort food. Jamie had better luck with the $13.50 Fish and Chips (see photo). The fish was light and the crust lightly crisp, while the accompanying tartar sauce had a nice kick of jalapeno. The cole slaw was good without being too vinegary, while the shoestring fries were plentiful and a bit spicy with paprika.  Mine was more of a tourist-targeted concoction, the $16.50 SF Crab &amp; Shrimp Sandwich, which came with the same shoestring potatoes (see photo). It was OK, although I have to admit the amount of shellfish slathered on the overwhelming slice of sourdough was on the paltry side compared, for example, to the likes of Woodhouse's Lobster Roll, an unfair comparison perhaps but inevitable in this case. The service was spotty with some customers definitely getting more attention and faster delivery of food than ours. Perhaps we weren't charismatic enough for the boisterous waitress in charge. Well, at least, we could enjoy the view.  FOOD - 3 stars...Fisherman's Wharf fare for the tourists and priced that way AMBIANCE - 4 stars...well, you have the view during sunny days and the bar for any other time SERVICE - 3 stars...spotty and preferential, neither of which were going our way on Sunday TOTAL - 3 stars...still middling after all these years",

The furniture is no frills, but it is a great spot for al fresco dining and a waterfront view. They also have a beer garden area if you are looking to relax with a beverage.   For my entree I had the fish tacos, which were great. It was an extra charge to add on avocado, which I did and I think that really upped their deliciousness. There was a great sauce served on the side with the tacos that I really enjoyed. My only pet peeve is that it didn't come with a side of any kind- you just got two tacos. One of my friends and I ended up getting a side of fries to share to make up for this loss ;).   Service was laid back, but not in a bad way.

They have this great covered patio that you could use anytime of the year.   The service was TERRIBLE! Our waitress came to take out order and then disappeared. I had to ask several other people for items and then our original waitress would bring it out. It wasn't even busy!   Long story short I accidentally left my phone there and when I called them they said they didn't have it. I turned on my 'wheres my iPhone' app and it showed it was at pier 23. I went back and they still insisted that they didn't have my phone even though you could hear it pinging. After persistence and trying to find it myself they finally gave it back to me. Shady business! I will not be returning...  ***see below for the full story***  The real kicker is I accidentally left my phone at pier 23. And I got all the way to the exploritorium before I realized it was missing. I called it 6 times and texted it. No response. My password doesn't kick in until after 4 hours. I used my friends iPhone to 'find my iPhone' and it showed it at pier 23 cafe. So I called them and they said no my phone wasn't there. We went back to the cafe and turned on the Ping sound. We went up to the bar and asked if they found a phone. They brought out a white phone from the back and a woman came out and claimed it. I asked if they had found any other phones and the bartender said no. Keep in mind this entire time you can hear my lost iPhone pinging. And I told the bartender that the pinging sound was my lost iPhone. And he was extremely resistant to help us find my phone until we started to look for the phone and started to get close to the phone and he jumped out from behind the bar and started to 'look' for it. Not until I started to look through the menus does he go 'oh let me look for it' and immediately pulls out a basket from behind the host stand and there is my phone pinging away.   I have worked in a restaurant for 9 years. And when someone leaves their phone or credit card you make a reasonable effort to find the owner. They never called any of my favorite contacts (the first one was the friend I was with that night and both my parents and my home number are on my favorites) and they never answered my many phone calls to my phone. My phone was not on silent. If someone calls a phone you found, you answer it! And if it's not the owner you ask the caller who the owner is and how to reach them!   So after all this shady business I will not be returning to pier 23 cafe. And I caution people to hold onto your valuables because these are not totally honest people!",

In the end, my daughter was still too uncomfortable under the sun so I asked to be moved inside. The server was very nice and got us new seats really quick.  FOOD: Clam Chowder (cup) - a little too salty for me, but the bread was really good when dipped in it.  SF Crab &amp; Shrimp Sandwich - came with garlic fries and salad. The best thing about this entree is the garlic fries. Really crunchy and just perfect for me. The salad wasn't that great and the sandwich is nothing special. A lot of crab and shrimp but the taste was very bland.  Hotdog + Fries (from Kid's Menu) - hotdog is like any other hotdog. The fries was good, but not as good as the garlic fries.",

    "review_text": "It's kind of like Applebee's on the Embarcadero.  After a night out at the Exploratorium, we needed some food and also wanted to be able to get a drink without having to walk to North Beach -- and there's not a lot of stuff in this area that fit the bill. So we headed to Pier 23 figuring it couldn't be that bad. When we first arrived, we saw there was a small jazz band up front and the whole front area is red-lit to give it kind of a French bistro vibe.  It was crowded, however, so we sat out back, at night, and the views were wonderful. Out back there's a covered area as well as an area heated by individual heaters so even at night in August in San Francisco it wasn't too chilly. So far so good!  They kind of ignored us for the first ten minutes we were there, but our waiter came up when I saw him realize no one had greeted us, apologized and got our orders. We did drinks, apps and main courses in one order. We also asked for bread and butter.  About 10 minutes later the drinks come out -- two Diet Cokes for the ladies, a dark and stormy for my friend and an old fashioned for me. Except my old fashioned was pink and appeared to have club soda on top; there was something bubbly, at least. I sent it back, to which our waiter responded \"what did you order again?\" and I switched to a whiskey coke, figuring that was probably easier. Spoiler alert: it was.  We also asked for bread and butter.  So we drank our drinks and hung out for a while, long enough for it to occur to us that we were getting pretty hungry and then food came out. I mean, all of the food came out. We had two apps and four main courses -- I'd ordered some fries as a side, but we didn't get those and it was probably for the best. After they dropped off all the food, we also asked for bread and butter  The firecracker taquito things looked as if they had pulled off the rotating thing at the 7-11 and tasted vaguely similar (and I actually like those as drunk food). The cream sauce on the plate congealed pretty quickly, which means we didn't finish them. The mac and cheese was fine -- overly cheesy but, hey, better than being under-cheesed.  Our main courses were perfectly fine, but not what I'd call \"good\". I had the fish tacos, which contained grilled fish (which was preferable to fried) but the tortillas were pretty stale tasting (or undercooked -- I'm kind of unclear). One of the lady's sandwiches had enough cilantro to build a forest out of it . The salmon with asparagus was ok.  After we finished half of our main course, we got the bread we had been asking for. It was basically a small loaf of white bread that had been baked, obviously, but was cold and dry when we got it. It also cost $1.50.  Overall, this appears to be the tourist place you stop at for the view and don't go to eat, so good for us to know. Just kind of found it out the hard way.",

Usually it was pretty busy and we had a couple drinks then moved on but the other night I wandered in on a weeknight with a friend and we started drinking.   They have a decent enough selection of beer that I'm not going to get stuck drinking something awful but it was lacking a real standout. We browsed the menu and my friend got some clam chowder but I wasn't craving anything they had. I think the menu is probably priced per the location versus what you actually get.   However, I had a great time just drinking and hanging out. There was a ragtime bad playing, which was kinda random, and we sat and people watched out the front windows for awhile then moved to the deck out back. It was wet out so part of the deck was covered but there are still a couple tables at the edge outside. Even in the dark the deck still has a good view of the bay. It's worth return trips just for the novelty of the location and how recognizable the place is. Even people that just vacation in SF have probably been in or at least remember seeing it.",

Umm, no way), my husband the scallop ceviche (light on the scallop, heavy on the sweetcorn, though tasty), then he tried the cheese plate (large portion of cheese, lots of garlic, weirdly, and four small crostini - would've been easy to improve this with better portions and presentation) and I had the strawberry chocolate cake cup (weird tasteless blancmange and chocolate cake - my own fault for ordering this without asking what on earth it was). The white wine my husband ordered was warm and tiny, our waters were never refilled and the service was pretty slow.

Their calamari is hit or miss, some days it is really really good and others its more on the rubbery side. The nachos are delicious though loaded with cheese.   Even on a windy day its not to bad because they have heaters on their patio. Their service has its ups and downs as well. We had Kimmy our previous visit who was probably one of the best servers I have had in the state of CA. On a sunny day it is a must. The only complaint I do have is the hostess was kind of a b*atch.

We were greeted promptly and cheerfully. There was a lovely view of the Bay. It was great to see relatives that I hadn't seen in 7 years.  Now the food.  We ordered calamari pasta carbonara, shrimp and crab sandwiches, a kid's burger, and salmon. I ordered a side-salad with my shrimp &amp; crab sandwich, to justify the additional side order of mac &amp; cheese with bacon.  Although my relatives appreciated being taken out, I was not impressed at ALL by the food. Calamari pasta carbonara looked mediocre, and the shrimp/crab sandwiches were greasy. I can't comment on the salmon or burger, as they were served pretty far down on the other side of the table. My side-salad greens looked and tasted like a soggy mass ready for the compost pile; I hoped that this was just appearance, and that I would be pleasantly surprised. I wasn't.  The mac &amp; cheese with bacon sounded VERY appetizing; the congealed mass with 2 strips of bacon carelessly thrown on top that appeared before me was not. How do you go wrong with mac &amp; cheese? And with BACON, no less?! It wasn't seasoned very well, so that you had all of the richness of the cheese, with absolutely no hint of salt. I didn't get that gooey goodness of melted cheese, or a cheesy sauce, much like the amazing mac &amp; cheese you get at the Fog City Diner...I got clumps. Tasteless clumps. Clumps with 2 strips of incinerated bacon thrown on top. Bleh.  When asked if we were interested in dessert, the reply was a quick \"No!\"  How did Guy Fieri get this place so WRONG? I'm saddened that THIS was what I brought my relatives to; I love my relatives, enjoyed their company, and wanted to share an amazing experience with them. The absence of anything good to say about this place spoke VOLUMES.  I have absolutely no desire to bring anyone else here. Unless I don't like them.",

It looks like an old shack...desolate... Once you walk in, there's not much action going on inside, but walk to the back and it's crowded! \u00a0It's first come, first serve and whatever table you find is yours. \u00a0Some people are really sneaky and will try to swoop up on a table even though you've been standing there waiting patiently for something to open up...tsk tsk!

They have good local CA beers on tap and the famous Dungeness crab on the menu. But wait... Bacon wrapped oysters? No where to be found on the menu. We promptly ask the wait staff about the missing item and their quick response was that it was taken off the menu. Why? They have new cooks since the show aired... 3 years ago! My friend still ordered the Dungeness crab and I hesitantly ordered the catch of the day which happened to be pacific perch. Moments when our food arrived we dug in. First thought... Bland. Probably the most unseasoned seafood I've ever had. Not just the perch but the Dungeness crab as well. For paying an easy Yelp $$, I would expect more. I've had better seafood in the Midwest. Clearly this place is still riding on the tails of their fame. We were better off going to Fisherman's Wharf and eating at the touristy Boudin Bakery. We would of paid less too for better food!

We ordered the fried calamari, fish tacos( Diners Drive-ins and Dives recommendation) and the crab &amp; shrimp sandwich.  We \u00a0sat outside on a windy cold day due to the lack of indoor seating they had. Sitting inside the plastic tent they had did not help much plus it had an odor maybe because of the wet plastic.  Overall, the food was okay and Service was pretty bad. It took a while for us to get noticed and served. Maybe they shouldnt have a sign that says to Seat Yourself. I would probably order the calamari again. the Fish tacos were good, but the side of beans and rice shouldnt be on the plate! the rice was dry and the beans were nothing special. The shrimp &amp; crab sandiwch was PLAIN! I wouldnt go back or recommend it.",

If you've made it that far alive, you'll be so out of it you won't notice the d-bags and their douchettes, the marina-ites, and crusty drunks. You will notice, however, slightly weak cocktails, overpriced food (who says you'll be able to eat?), and a view that that makes the whole big mess worth it.   On the other hand, if you're of the civilized persuasion (and yes, I CAN BE), this is a great place to start a Sex and The City style girls night out (Pier 23 is like the SF version of Staten Island) in order to enjoy the warm night's air, get some popped-collar to buy you a couple of those overpriced cocktails, and get your dancing queen on to live music.

My friend had the chowder ($4/cup, $7/bowl) and she very much enjoyed it. \u00a0She asked for some bread (to accompany her soup) and was surprised we were charged for an order of bread on our bill. \u00a0No big deal, but writing for review purposes here. I \"appetized\" on the Tuna Poke Tostada (3 for $11). \u00a0I think they were ~3\" rounds, a not too spicy tuna poke that appeared to spread on the tostada like a nice thick cream cheesy way, topped with a cilantro and shitake slaw that I thought had a nice flavor. \u00a0I really enjoyed the taste of the pieces of shitake mushrooms in the slaw, yumm! We shared an order of fried calamari ($11) served with both a tartar-like sauce as well as a cocktail sauce. \u00a0Slices of spicy jalapeno goodness and wonderful shavings of lime was found throughout, making a nice touch. \u00a0Unfortunately, I found the calamari to be a little dark on the fry, as well as a bit greasy. We shared the local crab and shrimp sandwich ($16.50) which also came with seasoned fries and a nice salad mix. \u00a0Boudin sourdough slices made up this sandwich and I have to say I would rather call the sandwich a \"Bay shrimp and a little bit of local dungeness crab sandwich\". \u00a0The sandwich was very good and had plenty of filling, but as mentioned, it was much more shrimp than crab. That was kind of a let down. \u00a0However, plenty of fries and I'm sad I didn't dig into the salad. \u00a0There was just too much food. Our server was very nice-top notch. \u00a0My friend was a bit indecisive throughout and we kept apologizing, and he kept checking on us all the while with a pleasant smile. \u00a0I'd go back in a heartbeat knowing how nice they were, didn't get sick, and I heard the Slow Cooked Babyback Ribs ($12) are to die for. \u00a0I can tell you they looked hella awesome, but will write a follow up if I get back to try them. Oh! Since I was driving, I didn't order an alcoholic beverage but I almost ordered a glass of their house made lemonade ($3.50). When I read \"Small Batch Root Beer\" ($4), I had to try it. \u00a0Ok, don't. \u00a0The root beer was a bottle of Henry Weinhard's. \u00a0I like Henry Weinhard's root beer, but I could buy a 6-pack at Safeway. \u00a0And if they offer that, why don't they just put that on their menu???",

My friend had the mussels and clams, which came in an amazing spiced broth. And my shrimp and crab sourdough sandwich was amazingly fresh and tasty! The bread wasn't dripping with butter, it was just lightly spread with it and soooo tasty.  The good: Very fresh and delicious seafood, as promised by Diners, Drive ins and Dives!  The bad: The 3/5 is mostly for the service. Waitors were pretty blase, and I get it because it's a \"divey\" kind of place. Also, although the food was really good, it wasn't blow my mind I'd come back here with out of towners good.  Ambiance: casual, quirky seafood cafe  Good for: a casual dinner with friends or family  What to know: The outdoor patio has a nice view of the water, but it's freezing there unless it's a rare sunny day!  Overall: Pretty good, casual seafood place- good for a beer and some seafood small plates.",

Let's start with the bad stuff. We were seated in the patio which was beautiful. We sat there for about 15 minutes before anybody came to take our drink order. I had to flag down a couple of waterboys before our server came by. She was really nice. Took our orders breezily and wandered off. Came back 20 minutes later and said (verbatim), \"ummm so I totally forgot what you ordered. Can you repeat it again?\"  I'm like wtf. Who the hell does that? And she didn't seem the least apologetic. Maybe if I wasn't so hungry, I'd be less of a raging bitch. Although at that point, I had to try my hardest to be super polite just because I didn't want my food spat on.   The food came and was total crap. My friend ordered fish and chips and I had the eggs 23. It probably wasn't THAT bad in perspective, but I was fuming from the wretched service.  Now onto the good stuff - they did keep refilling my water and coffee. And the sun was gorgeous that day, so can't complain. But I'd stay far, far away.",

(The first priority is hard to meet in SF)  With very little time to spare, Pier 23 became our answered prayer. The character of this place is undeniable: funky music, friendly service, cheeky posters and free cowboy hats. Yep, we would enjoy the last of daylight, San Francisco-style.  - To try: fried oyster sliders with fries. We missed the happy hour specials but these sufficed real nice. The thin-cut, crispy fries are dusted with cajun spicing that pairs oh so nicely with a solid beer and a fried oyster. - Sit outside with everyone else; they're friendly and will scoot to share a table with you. - I hear they have a bangin' reggae night on Saturdays - Park on Battery since the meters are free after 6!

Maikel Garcia is a truly gifted and talented sax player, along with pianist Don Alberts, drummer Art Lewis, and bassist Adam Gay. They played from around 8PM-10:30 with a set that included many of the popular jazz standards (including my favorite, Watermelon Man by Herbie Hancock), as well as a few original songs. They were professional, entertaining, energetic, and cohesive. Maikel was captivating and it was clear he knows his craft well. I love when you can feel the love that players have for their music, and how the music reverberates through your bones. I applaud their performance and look forward to seeing more of them!  The food and drinks were delicious, and both the hostess and our waitress were kind and accommodating. I highly recommend heading to Pier 23 if you are looking for some excellent live music and a good friday night!",

Unfortunately the sunny view of the bay and rockin music usually doesn't thrill the staff at Pier 23. My last visit to Pier 23 was a very sunny Friday around 6 at night. The entire staff had on black long sleeve t shirts and a look of anger I can not explain. Maybe it was the rowdy 20/30 somethings enjoying the sun? Maybe it was the Budweiser girls dressed like bad cowboys cheerleaders...idk?  Once our server acknowledged our presence we ordered a bucket of beers, which arrived shortly. We quickly killed that and it was time to order more drinks and this is when our waitress started to loose it. One of my friends ordered a margarita with salt only on half or the rim, insert crazy eyes from the waitress. No idea what the issue was with that. Next my other friend order a tequila w/ grapefruit juice, insert crazy eyes and shoulder shrug from the waitress. As the waitress made it around the table her crazy expressions got worse, to the point where one of my friends asked her if she was OK. She told us she had been working for 7 hours and was not pleased about it, we offered to buy her a drink and she just kept up with the crazy eyes.  Next came the seafood platter for 3....for 4 and boy did that suck. It was fries, 6 shrimp and a cup of calamari. Sooo Sad.

So, still had a nice view, but without as much of the wind and chill. Kudos for honoring commitments to those with reservations, and still finding a way to show that you want my business and accommodate my desire for a nice view!  The waitstaff was very nice. The drinks came out a bit slow, but the food came out quick. Had a cup of the crab bisque-good flavor, but a few small shell pieces and not much meat. The seared tuna sandwich with sriracha aioli was great! Properly cooked (which is to say not much) and the aioli was flavorful without the heat of the sriracha drowning out everything else. Lots of fresh herbs and flavor from that as well!  Glad I came!",

    "review_text": "I'd spent the day in the car driving my college roommate and her husband around SF. One of the main stops on my SF tours is always the Ferry Building, especially if it's market day on Saturday. \u00a0If you've lived in the city long enough to have been here before the '89 quake, then you remember the best-forgotten Central Freeway and its subsequent demise. The post-quake metamorphosis of the Embarcadero is, to my mind, the single-most important beautification project in the city, at least in the years I've lived here. The palm trees, the vibrant atmosphere, the updating of the Ferry Building, the Farmers' Market, AT&amp;T Park, the public art -- I love it all. Makes my spirit soar.  Which brings us to Pier 23. I was trying to think of a place that serves good food, offers a spectrum of draft beers on tap, and most importantly, has an amazing view of the bay. The fact that Pier 23 is semi-divey (in a good way) and calls to mind the kinds of places we frequented in college sealed the deal. The day was picture postcard perfect. You know the kind of day I mean -- cerulean blue skies, light balmy breeze, sunshine for days, with a delightful 78 degrees -- the kind of day where If you didn't live here already, you'd be figuring out how soon you could move here. Pier 23 was the perfect choice to enjoy all this splendor that is San Francisco.   We scored a table right on the water and watched as a cruise ship pulled into dock. Service was super-friendly and relaxed. Our meals were all delicious as well as generously portioned, and a draft beer was the perfect complement.   Yes, there are plenty of more upscale places to eat on the Embarcadero. But sometimes you just can't beat Pier 23. This was one of those days. Long live Pier 23!",

Thankfully we were treated to a great table right on the rail and had a great view of the sunset while we had drinks.  For dinner, the GF had the amazing grilled fish tacos. The fish was perfectly prepared and the corn salsa was excellent  I had the roasted whole crab special. The crab was amazing! Sweet, savory, simple and delicious.  The only complaint and hesitation from a 5star review was prices. For the type of food and preparation, the prices are a bit high. I understand that is the cost for fresh seafood, but I think prices are a notch high, but still worth it.  Pier 23 is a great place to take in the sunset and enjoy a solid meal",

I've been to a couple other places featured on the show and Guy was spot on with his review. However, the service at this place was AWFUL! We waited soooooooooo long for drinks. She messed up several orders at our table and told us that sodas did not include refills only after we'd ordered a few...shady if you ask me. To make matters worse, we'd been SOOOOOO looking forward to the duck poppers featured on the show...they said they were a special served Thursday - Sunday. Yea...they didn't serve them on the Thursday we went. Uhhh ok?   The hostess (and I think owner) was rude to a few of my friends for no good reason. I ordered the mussels and clams and a cup of clam chowder. First the waitress comes over and tells me they're out of clams...alright, no big deal mussels are my favorite! Then another 20 minutes goes by and a bus boy informs me they're out of clam chowder. My friend ordered the chicken wings as he's on a no carb diet...they're out of those. He orders a side salad instead of fries with the chicken/bacon sandwich with no bread...it comes with fries and bread, no salad. Another friend ordered the same sandwich...didn't even come with bacon on it so the waitress brought him a plate of under cooked bacon a little later.   The quality of the food was ok...my mussels were pretty good (although it didn't come with the bread it said it did on the menu). The roasted crab was pretty good but I think over priced.   Overall, I don't think we'll go back and I'm pretty disappointed with it being featured on Triple D.",

However, despite the $60 tab in addition to the first tab at the bar, the experience was priceless (I know I know, Mastercard copycat here) because I got to spend a few precious hours canoodling with my sweetie under an errant heat lamp.  The front is deceiving, because once you enter the small yet welcoming establishment, you don't realize how long it goes toward the back and opens out to a partial tent-covered deck and the open wood patio, saved by a few heat lamps.  Quaint and casual, bear in mind that you can smoke here, so every puff of wind brought along an unwelcome stink of smoke I had to duck or wave away. \u00a0Patrons here were casual and/or business crowd in suits.  The Happy Hour specials were not really that special, and the bottles of beer/pints were a little too expensive (um, hello, Frisson offers $5 happy hour specials and it's nicer inside) but I was humming along on my $6.00 Gin and Tonic. \u00a0In addition, this little lady was starving, so not only did we make quick work of the Buffalo Wings ($8-9 or so for only 10 wings, please) or the Caesar Salad (priced around $9 for a wretched bowl) and the Calamari (around $8-9, good and crunchy but a little burnt) but A L L \u00a0of this did not matter because of the company I was in.  In addition, the waitstaff including the bussers were sooooooo extremely nice and courteous, it swept away any negative ideas of the costs here.

I imagine on a warm sunny day this would be a great place to have drinks and watch boats go by. Then there is a semi-outside/inside area that is very casual and can accommodate a group if you have one. This is were we sat. Unfortunately, they do not service this area all night but you are welcome to sit here as long as you would like you just have to go to the bar and get your own drinks. The inside has seating and the bar and when we were there it was also housing a live band. Could be fun to sit in there too I suppose.   I wouldn't be apposed to going back at all.

The service is what killed this place for me. \u00a0They were so busy and totally unprepared for the nice weather - not enough servers for the outside seating area. \u00a0Also, they were so slammed that they weren't clearing tables fast enough to accommodate people lined up. \u00a0There were people in line staring at tables where people had left 5-10 mins prior. \u00a0I also watched a waitress bark at someone who walked in through the open side gate and mistakenly sit at a table. \u00a0She yelled, \"There's a line for these tables, SIR!\" \u00a0If it was me, I would have left, which is exactly what he did.  My server disappeared after she took my order. \u00a0The food runners and guys refilling my water glass were really busy and still very friendly and helpful. \u00a0However, I had to flag down a server more than 15 mins after I was done eating to bring my check and then my server dropped it off without saying anything, and acted as if I had offended her with the nerve to ask her to pay. \u00a0I mean, really? \u00a0I was warned it was a tourist trap, and for $18 for eggs &amp; a small cup of clam chowder plus crap service, I will skip it next time for somewhere better. \u00a0(Especially if \"better\" means a bagel &amp; coffee on the go.)",

I understand that you pay for the view/location when you hang out at a joint like this, but you should also have a reasonable expectation that the oysters on your *expensive* fried seafood platter won't look like something the cat vomited up. My partner cut into one as we were snacking and I almost passed out from how horrifying the thing looked.  Other than that, the portion was SMALL for a $23 plate of fried sea creatures that supposedly feeds three. Prawns were also barely edible, but the calamari was excellent. Margaritas are nice, beers are $6. Personally love sitting outside on a nice afternoon, but be warned...it smells, of course, like the bay.  Come prepared to fork over twice what you would at a decent happy hour, and leave before it gets too cold.",

This is my first time here so I wasn't sure where to go or what not, but quickly spotted the desk right in the front. Kind of hard to see people there were so many people inside, however I was patiently waiting for a worker to notice me. Saw a lady, didnt get her name...who did and she glance then walked away. She return to get something and finally say that she will be right with me. After coming back, she told me that there were seats outside, but it's very cold which I didn't mind at all so I kindly agree. What I thought was unnecessary was her tone of voice and how she told me that I cannot change my mind and move if it gets too cold. Thanks for the information, but girl, you need to be more kind. She also had me standing in the front while she went outside. Then expected me to see her from that little hall way, when she waved to come sit down. Aren't you suppose to come and walk with your guests so they know that you're ready and what not?  As far as food, the baked oysters were the best! Ordered two of that and wanted more, but stopped myself. Each contain 3 oysters for $9. I also ordered fish and chips and a crab/shrimp sandwich which I thought were just okay. Th fish and chips needs something more...kind taste plain to me while the sandwich was more on the better side. On the good not: the waiter and waitress outside were fantastic!

My ratings below are on taste ONLY, not on price/value (I'll get there in a minute!).  Garlic Prawns- (4.5) Spicy and full of garlic flavor, perfectly cooked and succulent. Crab and Shrimp Sandwich- \u00a0(3.5) Served on thick toasted &amp; buttered sourdough! Crab and (minuscule) Shrimp is mixed with plain ol' mayo, comes with lettuce and thin sliced red onion, still very under seasoned.  Fries- (4.5/5) DELICIOUS! Crispy and extremely thin shoe string Fries tossed in a garlic-parsley butter. The seasonings on the fries is not at all over powering, very light garlic taste. Fish &amp; Chips- (4) Fresh and crispy served with a Jalapeno Reuben sauce. They don't have tartar sauce available but the JR is surprisingly good. Grilled Fish Tacos- (4) Fish + Roasted Tomato Salsa = Good Pork Carnitas Slider- (2) Average. Crab Cake Slider- \u00a0(4.5) My favorite but not always on the menu = huge disappointment.  Bacon Mac &amp; Cheese- (1.5/2) Not at all impressive.  ***NOW, here is my problem.... PRICE! Garlic Prawns Appetizer are $12 for 6 average sized shrimp, breaks down to $2 a shrimp!!! Crab and Shrimp Sandwich is (1) not made with lump crab meat, (2) extremely small blah shrimp, and (3) it's just all in all EH, nothing special.... for $17! That's a joke right? Everything I've tried seems to be more expensive than it should be.***  Service is decent, food is good, prices are ridiculous, but back patio is nice and relaxing.

Oh, the excitement about going to a new place (new to us, that is). Park in the public self-park area down the way near a tiny exercise field- pseudo soccer (sorta weird but hey whatever works, right?). There were people not paying and I would advise against that, but anyway, I'm just saying.   Borrowed sombreros and umbrellas shield you from the sun's warm rays. Near the water, it's windy. Nice vibe. Lots of people. Popular place. We moved into the shade because I was wearing a long-sleeved top and it was warm in the sun. My face was glistening. Uber-tiny bathroom for customers- it should be classified as a 1/4 bathroom, seriously. Seating in front (bar) is a tight squeeze.   I ordered the fish tacos- ensenada style (roasted tomato salsa) and my husband had the fish &amp; chips- both $13.50 each. I liked that his fish was not soggy, or greasy, and was a bit crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. I liked my tacos; a bit of a fish taco enthusiast \u00a0(ok, the best ones so far, are in mexico and hawaii). I liked it but my husband was not really impressed and didn't think that it was anything special. The servers are kind of quirky but I like that relaxed vibe (attitude/personality, not in service, though). I noticed that many people ordered the Crab &amp; Shrimp Louis Salad. It's not a big place but many of the seats were occupied. If we go back (if my husband wants to give it another chance, that is), I want to try the corned beef hash &amp; fried egg on the brunch menu, as well as the strawberry shortcake (one of my favorites). Large menu- wine and beer- so many different selections. Also does platters for catering.",

The first time was OK, but it was a cold and rainy November night and the only place to sit was in the cold and damp back dining area with a faulty space-heater. However, yesterday was a beautiful and sunny November afternoon, so we decided to sit out back on the deck overlooking the bay, ordered a couple drinks and dove into the menu. We decided to get the sardines on bruschetta, and fish tacos with a side salad. Man, we could have eaten twice the amount. I say this not because the serving sizes are scant, but because they are dang good dishes! The tacos came with a roasted tomato salsa (not too spicy) and an avocado sauce. The tilapia is grilled and the corn tortillas are warm and slightly crispy. I don't remember the other ingredients, but don't worry about it...try 'em! The bruschetta came with grilled sardines (not from a can, novices:) and was topped with chopped kalamata olives, tomatoes and parsley...and I'm pretty sure there was some olive oil and/or a vinaigrette drizzled on top and served on toasted slices of sourdough.   Overall, the place is trendy and touristy, but worth checking out just for these two menu items. I've heard a lot of good things about other items too...which is enticing. They could increase their menu options, and I would love to see them incorporate sustainabiy, local raised products as well as more vegan, vegetarian items. That would push them from 4 to 5 stars in my book. \u00a0There's expensive parking next door if you're driving.",

The place itself did have a cool outdoor area and fortunately it was actually a really nice night out so that was cool.  Some other things that lowered my opinion of the place. \u00a0The sound guy there wasn't that good and the singer of the band couldn't even hear himself. \u00a0My friend and lead singer's girlfriend's purse got jacked which totally ruined her night. \u00a0I called before I left and asked where to park and they recommended the street right in front of the place. \u00a0I got there and found a spot like 50 feet away checked the signs to make sure it was legit but when I came back had a $50 parking ticket. \u00a0The mustache man failed to give me a good story while maintaining a general vibe of doucheness.",

But other than that, our waiter was nice and the food came out in a decent amount of time.   Appetizers: We had the Fried Calamari and the Bacon Fried Oysters. Both were really good especially the bacon fried oysters. Though sadly, there were only 4 small pieces for the price of about $12 which is really expensive for an appetizer for such a small amount on your plate.   Entree: My dad and I had the SF Crab and Shrimp Sandwich ($16) and the cup of Clam Chowder (~$4). My mom, brother, and sister had the Crab Cioppino ($28). And my brother's gf had the Prawn Quesadilla ($?) and the cup of Clam Chowder. My sandwich was delicious and I loved how they gave so much shrimp and crab in it. The fries I had with my plate were really good too, seasoned well, and it also came with a salad which was good as well. The chowder was alright, I've had better. I tasted some of the Cioppino and it was pretty good for having it the first time, but according to my brother it had a different taste than the other Cioppinos that he's had that were better.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal and I was really full to the point where I almost couldn't finish my sandwich but I did. The only thing I didn't like was that this place is pretty pricey for a college student like me but it's understandable since it is a seafood place.",

We mention it to the waitress, who checks on the status of this drink....and comes back to tell me that they were waiting on ingredients. \u00a0??? \u00a0Couldn't someone have told me this earlier, so I could order a different drink? \u00a0Maybe the staff don't communicate with each other about the status of different items on the menu? \u00a0I don't know, maybe something like \"We can't serve anymore mojitos until the mint arrives\" or whatever. \u00a0I tell her that's okay, I can wait. \u00a0  I continue waiting. \u00a0Finally got my drink 45 minutes after I ordered it. \u00a0Still waiting on my tiny $5 slider with mixed greens. \u00a0Other friends at my table, who ordered 30 min after me, receive their food (which they also made a mistake with). \u00a0I mention this to a server. \u00a0They apologize, and at 7:20, a FULL HOUR after I first ordered, I receive my one little slider. \u00a0It was pretty good. \u00a0The drink was pretty good too. \u00a0But a whole hour? \u00a0  Fast forward to the end, where we get the check: \u00a0nothing has been comped. \u00a0Interesting. \u00a0I work at a restaurant, and when we make a mistake, or take A FREAKING HOUR to serve someone their food (which does not happen), we apologize profusely and either bring them a complimentary dessert or comp them the item that was forgotten. \u00a0Especially when it's someone's birthday.  Maybe this place gets most of its business from one time tourists, so they don't need to make any efforts to have good customer service or make sure that people have a good experience and return in the future. \u00a0Maybe they have a restaurant policy where they don't comp things when make mistakes are made. \u00a0I understand very well that mistakes happen, but in the restaurant industry, you can't just say sorry as you're walking by and not do anything to make up for it. \u00a0 \u00a0  Whatever the reason is, that experience was enough to make me not want to go back. \u00a0There are other places in SF with a water view that have better service, are not as grungy, and have equally good or better food.",

They deserved maybe a 10% tip or less. Also, the atmosphere outside is that of a trailer trash picnic area.

After being seated it seemed like 30 minutes before anyone even came to our table. The price of the Ciopinno is not on the menu so when the waitress finally came to our table I asked her how much it was and she said $17. So I ordered the Ciopinno and I could have made it better blind folded. I got 3 muscles, 3 clams, and 3 shrimp and the crab wasn't even in the shell. The crab was nothing but mush mixed in with the sauce. My Son got the catch of the day which wasn't enough food even for a 2 yr old which was $17 not to mention the fish on the outside was hard as a rock! My sons girlfriend ordered the ribs/fries with a side of Mac n Cheese. The ribs were very fatty. The fries were good and the best thing on our entire table was the Mac n Cheese, so we all took our forks to the Mac n Cheese and Fries. Anything that was seen on Triple D wasn't even on the menu, so that was a GREAT disappointment also. To top it off when our bill came, my Cioppino was $28!!! What???? i called the waitress over and asked her, \"remember when I asked you how much the Cioppino was and you said $17???\" She said, \"oh I'm sorry maybe I misunderstood what you asked me\" Seriously??? how could you misunderstand when I was pointing right at it when I asked her and she was looking at it??? OH WELL, She still got a 20% tip. Live and learn..................",

I notice another guy seated after me eating while I was still waiting. Fair or not, that is massive pet peeve of mine. The server/bartender definitely wanted to be elsewhere and it showed.

I just had the opportunity to eat there on Sunday.  I knew about the music from Joseph, the lead guitar player from the Native Elements who play there regularly. But, I didn't know they had great food and it has a very interesting history -- a special ambiance, enriched with famous photos of one of SF's favorite strippers, Sally Rand and her \"Posse de Pussy\". \u00a0  The vibe is sexy, salty, cool, and funky, all at the same time. it's the kinda place you see a mash-up of city culture, urban couture, hippy and cool. Feel/hear it as the bassman digs a deep bottom thumpy beat and the band hits the mark changes and the vocalist is getting the call and response with the audience just right and everything keeps you, the dance-mob on the dance floor, and the staff, shakin', shiftin' and movin', nothing stands still, ever.   But I digress, there was plenty of room on the sunny deck for our whole group as we waited for our table to be prepared in \"the Annex\" for dinner. The house drinks and a long list of special libations awaits. The compact seating arrangements, made it easy to meet friendly table neighbors learning how to enjoy Tequila shots and other intake methods.  We were all enjoying the 70+ degree warmth and ambiance by the bay. Our waitperson, Tracy, was cordial, in good spirits, helpful, talented and creative. When we moved inside to our dinner seating, it gets even better. Tracy sat us at our \"Red and White gingham oil cloth covered, \"big-night\" dinner table (perfect for eight), and got us settled with wine and three orders of Sweet Potato fries to share. Timing was such that we were immediately served water, bread, salad and our crab. Our group happened have a local who knew to order our three oven roasted crabs, and all the dinner stuff while we were still basking in the patio sunshine.  It was terrific! The best oven-roasted crabs; sweet, perfectly cooked, drenched in bread-sopping garlic butter, and seasoned just right for keen and discerning palates. We paired it with a buttery Sauvignon Blanc. The fresh romaine lettuce hearts salad was satisfying. And, I topped it off with a couple of BBQ ribs. Others said they enjoyed their sliders. No room for desert.  So, when you want something special, start cracking oven-roasted crabs along the sea shore at Pier 23!",

I couldn't really tell what kind of crowd it attracts... definitely lots of visiting FiDi businessmen and tourists but didn't seem to be many locals. \u00a0  Onto the food...  We started with calamari which was average. I liked that they included jalapenos so you could make your calamari spicier if you wanted.  For my entree I had their shrimp &amp; crab louie salad. I wasn't super impressed. It was shredded iceberg lettuce with tiny shrimps and some big pieces of crab. It really needed more lemon!  What my Dad had looked the best - shrimp &amp; crab sandwich - basically my salad on a bun. It was HUGE. Plus half a plate of seasoned thick cut fries. That's what I'd order here.  Mom had a bowl of mussels and clams. I tried the white wine sauce with the complimentary bread. I've had better (like at Plouf) but she seemed to enjoy it.   The service was extremely slow. We noticed tables around us getting food before us even though they were seated after us. Don't come here if you are in a rush.",

Well, this was the second time I was here, and the first was better b/c it was happy hour during the week on a Thursday. Apparently it's a magnet for the Marina ilk and metrosexuals on the weekends. I was there on a Saturday for reggae night w/my gf and her friend and it was not the best experience at all.  I got there around 6:30 and the douchebags and their dumb bitches were just leaving, but not quick enough b/c you could still hear their empty conversations. Our server was pretty quick and attentive and made sure we were taken care of. Bartender has a light hand though b/c I had to send my screwdriver back twice! Food was regular beach style bar fare; burgers, fried this, boiled that, steamed these. Nothing on the menu really jumped out so I ended up splitting the fried seafood sampler. Shrimp were good size and decently fresh and calamari was pretty good too. What can I say, it was fried.  Then came the rest of the evening... The crowd was horrible! Stuck up snobby bitches in whack ass clothes w/their ugly feet jammed into high heeled shoes. Trying to dance like Betty Boop to reggae isn't cute, it's FUCKING LAME! Guys w/70's style haircuts, tight ass jeans and sunglasses on at night, really!? Where the fuck do these peeps come from!?  The saving grace of the evening was the company I was keeping and the band Iration playing their Jawaiian style music. I won't be back here during a nighttime event, but I may come back for happy hour.",

Pier 23 is a grungy little shack from the front, with a huge outdoor deck on the back, perfect for group happy hours that stride well into the night. There is usually a live band that kicks off every night, sometimes performing out on the deck under the fairy lights. On a beautiful night, there is nothing more chill, than to enjoy a drink on the water, watching people dance, chat and laugh away.  Be warned though, the service is pretty poor here-- so only go if you are with a bunch of friends who can distract you from your empty bottle! The food is pretty mediocre too, and I definitely wouldn't eat here again. Everything is bland and overpriced, and you can tell by the taste that the guy serving you water could possibly be the chef there as well.

The sweet potato fries weren't too soggy, the regular fries had a nice kick to them, and the steak sliders were okay. The calimari was pretty greasy, and bland.  They've got a decent selection of beer, though kinda pricey. Not really wanting to pay $3.50 for a PBR.  We were on the patio during a very windy day, and we were kept warm by their plastic canopy that zipped up. Though the amount it shook and the noise it made was scary! Don't worry, it seemed like it was pretty stable and not going to collapse.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.

I can't believe I've always walked past this place every time I've been in the bay area and never gave it a chance. But the boy and I finally decided to give it a try one Saturday afternoon because we needed to refuel. We walked in and immediately found two seats at the bar. We ordered some beers, which at $6 a pint isn't a great deal. But hey, we were thirsty. We also ordered a cup of clam chowder and the beef and cod/shrimp sliders to snack on. I wasn't too thrilled about the clam chowder as it was watery and somewhat bland. I suppose I should have waited until I got to Fisherman's Wharf. However, the sliders weren't bad at all! The meat wasn't overcooked and there was some good flavor to it. The cod/shrimp slider was especially tasty! The sliders were the perfect afternoon snack.   What really makes this place awesome though is the atmosphere. The bartenders were so nice and made conversation with the people sitting at the bar. It's also a great place to chat it up with other out-of-town folks. The boy and I had such a great time meeting random people. I've realized that I always have the most fun at the most unassuming places. Next time, I definitely won't overlook Pier 23.",

I ordered the SF crab and shrimp sandwich, which came with a side of french fries. This sandwich had a very generous portion of seafood stuff in between two slices of SF sourdough bread. \u00a0Some reviews here mention that there wasn't enough seafood and some mention there was too much (how can you EVER have too much???) but I thought it was a decent, healthy serving. \u00a0I could definitely taste the fresh seafood and was worried about it being drenched in some mayo-based dressing but it was not. \u00a0The fries were hot and crisp and well seasoned. \u00a0It was hard not to eat them all. \u00a0A very cold hard apple cider accompanied my meal.  My friend had some oysters and the tuna poke tostadas and found them to be to her satisfaction. \u00a0I noticed quite a few people ordering the tostadas, so they must be quite good. \u00a0  Overall service was okay. \u00a0As you can imagine it was very crowded out on the patio but we were served in a reasonable amount of time. \u00a0Our waiter came by a couple of times to check on us and our water glasses were refilled a few times. \u00a0  Prices are a tad high, but that's to be expected when taking into consideration the \"view\" tax.  Hats are available for anyone to use to provide some much needed shade. \u00a0Word of advice: \u00a0if you don't want to become as red as a lobster, sit in the shaded area of the patio. \u00a0It can get really hot out there! \u00a0The view from the patio is spectacular! \u00a0  At the time of my visit I would say the crowd was a good mix of locals and tourists. \u00a0The vibe is laid back and relaxed. \u00a0Everyone was there to have a good time, enjoy the view and soak in the sun. \u00a0Oh, and to eat some fresh seafood. \u00a0There is live music in the late afternoon and evenings. \u00a0Pier 23 is good for small and large groups.

When I walked in I thought they were closed, as there was no other customers in the restaurant. The server was very friendly and because there were no other customers, I got a seat right away. Even though it was a little bit chili, I decided to sit out on the deck next to the bay.   Pier 23 has a good beer selection, because I was in San Fran, I went with an Anchor Steam. They had featured the grilled fish tacos on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, so I decided to go with those.   The food came out really quick and looked amazing. The order came with three grilled fish tacos with some guacamole and salsa on the side. I decided to have one taco with guacamole, one taco with salsa, and one taco with both. All three were good, with the best being the taco with guacamole.   Friendly and quick service, great atmosphere, good beer selection, and very tasty food, give Pier 23 Cafe five stars.",

I like the fact that they try to source locally and sustainably for their seafood. The miyagi oysters on hand were medium sized. I'm not the world's biggest miyagi fan and the meats were shriveled, but it's personal preference.  I really liked the cod and shrimp slider with fries. For $5 this is a great deal and the fries were seasoned with a red dusting of pepper that was delicious.   Pier 23 Cafe is a great hidden gem if you want the waterfront view without the waterfront prices. It can get noisy in the front of the bar but make reservations for the back. The service was a bit slow after we finished, but in general the atmosphere was fun and casual.",

So we moved over to the bar and told the bartender and ordered another drink (he was very nice and friendly)... he even took care of a round of drinks for us, asked to order some food and would told they had to check with the kitchen because they close at 10pm so just said forget it ( only to discover it was 20 minutes to 10pm - guess they just didn't feel like cooking anymore)...   Oh the band playing was a joke.... it was a Reggie band... heard maybe half a song then it seemed like dead air for a long time like they had disappeared.   Oh don't ask about getting a cab, they said they could or wouldn't come there to go across the street to the diner of the corner... forget that they wont help with a cab either... suggest you add the cab company number to your cell before you go to the city or leave your hotel (or see if the hotel has arrangements with a service for guest pick ups).",

There's always a long ass line for the women's bathroom! It's a little wait to get drinks at the small bar, but it's not too bad and the bartenders are nice. The bouncers are way sweet too.

Came in with a party of 10 for lunch all co-workers, at the end of lunch rush, 1:15ish. Place is busy but not full by any means as we were a walk up group. Our waiter seems OK at first but then things go down hill.  Long story short we catch him saying under his breath (but loud enough that most of us can hear him) that he thought our table would be bigger and you can tell he must have won the game of Rock-scissor-paper with his co-worker and expected more. He forgets 1 of our parties drink order, then after 1 hr of waiting for our food we ask him to put everything in boxes as we have to leave soon.  Sounded Good on paper except for the fact that it took 20 more mins to get our food BUT we did get the 1 appetizer we ordered about 10mins before our food. Good to know that they are classy enough to give you the appetizer before your meal. \u00a0This whole time I'm watching other people that came in later then us get there food.  What was the Cheery on top for this great experience you ask?   Well I walk right across the street to where I work and wouldn't you know it my food was cold, yeah I love cold Fries and hard twice cooked bread!  Like I said drinks and happy hour are fun there but expecting anything else is like expecting for a politician to believe what he/she is saying.  Cheers, Tim",

What I think makes the difference in Calamari, which I love, is the dipping sauce they give you. the jalape\u00f1o aioli is phenomenal, we then jumped in and both had the whole Dungeness Crab. How they roast the crab and the broth they cook it is make is some of the best crab you will have.   Also if you like Crab cakes theirs won't disappoint.  Enjoy!",

I'd like to tell whoever owns this place they need to get rid of an older (perhaps the oldest) Brunette lady that works there who has the SHITTIEST ATTITUDE towards customers and employees. I SWEAR SHE WAS ON HER RAG or something. I would love to return and tell her she's a dumb bitch. If you hate your job, quit. She cuts customers at half sentence, she makes no eye contact, she is not polite, I saw her treat her employees rudely when they were trying to help her out. Besides that... my lunch experience was fine. The other employees who seem to work under the bitch were great employees. Polite, fast service, and attended to our needs. The 6 of us sure tipped our server pretty nice.  Came here with a group of friends on a Saturday early afternoon to have lunch. I kept my order simple because I had a light appetite.   HEFFER-STYLE STATUS.  CHICKEN PARMESAN SLIDER w/ FRIES ($5) - that simple! I didn't expect the slider to be that tasty or of that size. It was just right for my small figure. I wasn't that hungry but it was better then eating a boring salad. Slider was the size of my palm and a plate of shoe string fries. I love shoe string fries. They were very tasty shoe string fries.  My friends enjoyed their lunches too... some had the clam chowder, fish &amp; chips, sliders, sandwich, etc.  Will I be back? YUP.  Until the next review...",

I ordered up muscles &amp; clams followed by fish tacos. \u00a0The steamers had plenty of morsels for two and the broth was buttery, not too garlicky and had a nice spice. \u00a0Just as I finished mopping up every wonderful flavor, the fish tacos arrived. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0Mexican style big chunks of fish with string peppers, onions &amp; lettuce... just amazing flavors. \u00a0The mahi mahi had a mild spice and a caramelized flavor that put all the fish tacos I've had in Hawaii to shame! \u00a0I was expecting much less from the food but it was soooo good I had to tell you about it!

It tastes very refreshing and I could imagine eating it on a warm summer day. \u00a0 Warning: It's very large!

Tiny on the inside, but the band plays in the back so thats where you should be. 1 full bar inside, and 1/2 a bar in the back with a limited selection. be prepared to wait for drinks inside.  $10 cover and no strict dress code. Pier 23 isnt the fanciest place or the roomiest, but its cozy and a great place to chill and listen to good reggae played by a live band, NATIVE ELEMENTS!",

The menu was small and a bit expensive for the quality of the food. We did order French fries after being ask for our preference and got potatoes chips. Lol. Hmmm. They do have a good location and it always seems busy. I have to say I am not impressed more disappointed in the lack of tastefulness in the food. I will continue to explore other seafood restaurants for some quality clam chowder. How do you get clam chowder wrong in the Bay Area!? That baffles me!",

While it is set on the water, your views are locked in by two pier buildings on both sides, so the view is not quite the panoramic extravaganza. \u00a0I can see how it would be fun for brunch with a band playing and lots of cocktails though.

Our waiter seemed a bit distracted, and took a while to get our drinks, and bring us our food (and our bags to go!).  A friend of mine asked his opinion on certain dishes and even though you never like to hear staff badmouth anything from their place of work, it was refreshing \u00a0that he was so honest.  I ordered the Poke Tostadas and they were pretty delicious. They come three to a plate and I could barely finish one and a half! My friend ordered the salmon with capers, and that was pretty tasty and filling too.  The food wasn't outstanding, and I guess if you can afford the dungeoness crab (which was featured on DDD), then I guess it might be worth the hype.

Sometimes waiters/waitresses want to be \"cool\" with the guests to build a relationship and get more tips but this woman was just trying too hard to be cool and not trying at all to be a good server.   Not only did she ask like 5 times for our drink order in her 1st encounter w us (party of 2), which was 2 Bloody Maries (simple enough) but she comes back to check on us asking \"where'd these fuckers go?\", pointing at the empty chairs. It was only two of us from the get go and if we did have a bigger party I didn't appreciate that she was referring to them as \"fuckers\".   Another thing, out of nowhere she comes with a bunch of drinks. Again, its only two of us. She seemed very confused about who ordered them and at this point I was already concluding that she's drinking on the job. Oh, and she asked to take a selfie with my girlfriend and me in the middle of asking for another round of drinks, which... Yes, you guessed it, did not come, EVER!   Anyway, we ask for our check and to no surprise it was all wrong. We were being charged for 5 drinks that we did not order on top of our order. Needless to say, she did not get a tip from us.   I probably will never go to this place again. We ordered the chips and dip and fried calamari and they weren't spectacular but not terrible either. Bloody maries were also just ok.   Btw, I have the selfie of this girl and I will post it on the photos for this restaurant :D too silly.",

The tuna poke was good, but it was not worth the money and the Fish &amp; Chips which the majority of my coworkers had, appeared very greasy.

This one ranks up there with some of the best finds ever.  Sure, parking is a crap shoot. But it's the Embarcadero and that's just the way it is. Once you get inside the hostess will take you to the huge back patio you didn't think was there from the front (they have live music in the front bar area in the evenings and it's likely loud and cozy) and ask if you want to sit in the \"sun or shade\". There's a mix of tourists and locals and that's always a good sign. You sit right on the water...not a fancy view but pleasant and fun.  Fantastic bloody Mary's! Okay beer and wine selection. Home made lemonade. Fast wait service once you sit down. Nice so far.  The oysters were ok...not too small and really fresh. But for $2.50 EACH I wish I had ordered the steamed mussels and clams my sister did. They were fantastic! Probably the best of anything we all ordered that afternoon. I'm not sure what they were thinking with the odd vinegar dip for the oysters. I love vinegar and it was so not a match for the oysters...so not.  The clam chowder was plenty warm in the cool San Francisco weather. Lots of nice clams and flavor. The bowl was well worth the $7. They will charge you extra for bread but there is enough to share in the $1.50 side order.  Another highlight was the Agave Nectar Scallop Ceviche at 14.5. With grilled corn, avocado, red onion with roasted poblano mole it was a very unique and tasty ceviche. The grilled corn was a brilliant addition to the usual ceviche.  The hostess was very friendly and helped us buy some of their really cute t-shirts. The waitress was not very friendly but brought everything quickly and correctly.",

Then as we patiently waited to order some drinks the bartender completely ignored us and continued his knuckle head banter with his co-worker. We stood there sort of dumbstruck, for five to ten minutes, as we waited for him to finish his conversation.   Ummm, \"Two beers please, hello.\" Nothing.

I have ordered fish and chips at MANY places and besides London, this is probably some of the best I've had. Ask for extra of the spicy aioli sauce! The coke flaw was surprisingly delicious, the cod was perfectly fried and the fries were also perfect, not too greasy. We finished the entire plate and I highly recommend it!  Bf ordered the chopped fresca salad and also, enjoyed it. However, he had half oft meal... So who knows ;)  Ambiance: Perfect! Sit outside and enjoy the view or sit inside and enjoy the live music!

We sat on the back patio around sunset time and it was a really fantastic place to be.  The clam chowder here was very good. Not the best I've had in SF but still rich and thick and full of clams and not to salty. We got the Mussells with Chorizo and coconut milk and the fish and chips. I was skeptical about the mix of mussells chorizo and coconut flavors - but I was totally wrong, it was unbelievably delicious. Big portion too we weren't able to finish it all. The fish &amp; chips were good, but nothing spectacular. The mussells were definitely the highlight of the meal if you go here I really recommend you try them.",

We were promptly sat at a table outside, but the hostess put us on the far side of the place at a deserted table, near the bus boy stand and trash cans. Um, really? So we asked to move, which they happily obliged.   Take two. We were sat at a perfect table outside with a gorgeous view of the ocean. We were hungry but not starving and wanted something fresh and light to share. We settled on the grilled artichoke to start and the Pier 23 Cafe special- the whole garlic dungeness crab.   The artichoke was light and yummy, the perfect appetizer, served grilled with some yummy red sauce and hummus. Nice, light, nothing to scream about from the rooftops but enjoyable.  The crab though...omg. It was beautifully presented, with the claws stacked neatly and the head of the crab cracked open and filled with yummy buttery, garlic, crabby sauce. Served with a loaf of bread to lap up the sauce, it tasted like the ocean and heaven. I could have just eaten the sauce and bread and been happy. But alas, I dug into the crab legs too. Light and tender, but crab is never filling enough. Yummy though....   So why 3 stars? Well, the crab was $38!!!!! Are you kidding? A little pricier than it was worth when I can go to Joe's crab shack and get WAY more food for less...but the quality was better... I would have loved some live music or some music at all while enjoying the breeze and sunshine. We asked our server repeatedly for more napkins to clean our crabby hands, the napkins never came. Final thing: they have straw hats you can borrow to shade yourself from the sun. Gross. Someone else's sweat and lice is less than appealing.   I did enjoy my meal here as a tourist, but would probably not come here again as there are so many amazing restaurants in the city.",

We were a group of 9, so we made a reservation, they included an automatic gratuity on the bill: a fair trade.   The weather was perfect, warm and breezy, so sitting on their semi-enclosed deck in lightweight plastic chairs was comfy enough and appropriate for the ambiance.  Although our arrival times were uncoordinated and the place overflowing with customers, the hostess and servers were pleasant and patient, as well as attentive once we assembled. Meanwhile, we ordered Chips (fresh, slightly on the heavy side), Black Bean Dip (tasty, not quite spicy enough for me), a couple of beers, &amp; a couple bottles of wine (decent selection, reasonably-priced, mostly $30-45 range), and at least one Bloody Mary.  One couple had been here before, so we ordered 5 Shrimp &amp; Crab sandwiches (generous portions on toasted sliced French bread), based on their recommendation. There were also orders of Fish Tacos (grilled, good, fresh-tasting) and Corned Beef Hash &amp; Eggs (also reportedly good). The sides of Fries and Slaw were respectively average and above-average in quality.  Overall, a pleasant experience, a fair value, and worth repeating.",

    "review_text": "Wow. I always considered Pier 23 to be somewhat of a dive bar. I never thought of it as a place to eat. If I were to eat there (and I had not prior to this visit), I would have just expected typical bar fare. Boy was I surprised!  My friends who were visiting from LA selected this restaurant. Well, my friend's husband did, because they wanted seafood. (When my friend, the wife, saw pictures of the place and heard that most of the tables were outdoor, she wasn't so thrilled). In the end, we seated in a covered patio area (and outdoor tables have heat lamps) so the weather wasn't really an issue. But who would have thought that this bar would be known for their seafood? Well, don't be too quick to judge. As soon as we sat at our table, I asked our server about which dishes were popular. She mentioned: *Calamari (to share) *Crab Cakes *SF Crab &amp; Shrimp Sandwich *Fish Tacos *Baby Back Ribs  Do any of those sound like typical bar food to you? Not really. So I decided to get the SF CRAB &amp; SHRIMP SANDWICH, which was amazing! Incredibly fresh and sweet seafood. Huge portion. Not richly covered in dressing. Great deal! My friends also ordered the Calamari for the table, and several bowls of Clam Chowder. The chowder is good, especially if you like chowder. It's not the best that I've had, but it's good enough. Someone also ordered the BABY BACK RIBS, which were fall off the bone tender. Someone else ordered the whole Roasted Dungeness Crab (2lbs @ $45) and was incredibly happy with each bite of his meal.  If you're just looking for a place to grab a drink, go out and enjoy their Beer Garden. Great patio on a nice day! Plenty of seating and bay view!  All in all, good choice.",

    "review_text": "I have come to this Cafe many, many times over the many years, the food is very good for local fair, nothing to jump over the bridge about (my fave is the SF Crab &amp; Shrimp Sandwich $19), but all around good food and a large menu, there is music nearly every night and it is VERY GOOD music. \u00a0Drink are drinks, being a new Bloody Mary fanatic it is now my measure of standard in all brunch drinks, theirs is OK, not great but ok, the one thing I do like is that they will use string green beans instead of the traditional stalk of celery, nice change up to the standard, the base could use a little more HR to spice it up though. The actual bar is small. The deck view is nice, it does not have a lot of \"view\" unless the bay has some active sailing going on, it is nicely nestled between the piers with a large wedge of the bay viewable. \u00a0Pier 23 is all about the music and dancing after 6pm. \u00a0Great night spot to party on the wharf and pier 39 is about 1/4 mile down so a nice stroll alo ng the Embarcadero can be had. This is not a late night spot, Kitchen closes @10PM, Bar closes at midnight. The wait staff needs some better management. \u00a0If you are going to work in customer service, especially wait staff service you better like what you do and be able to do it well, Wait service is demanding, (been there done it) You must be ubber attentive, slap happy to be there and willing to hustle til your feet bleed and no hanging out at the bar chatting with the hot bar tender and his friends. Wait staff here can be slow and forgetful, but again the place gets packed and this can in and of it's self slow things down. \u00a0 Pier 23 is a nice place to go on a sunny afternoon or a warm night anytime to hear good music and dance a little, weekdays the business crowd comes in full strength and seating can be tough. \u00a0Parking can be had on the street (metered) no lot parking, All in all a good place to come with good food.",

The downside was that by this time (around 3ish) the teeny little bar was getting filled to capacity and the bartender looked like he was having trouble mulit-tasking. \u00a0Our mixed drinks weren't good this time around and still expensive. \u00a0We had better service when we were seated in the restaurant part. \u00a0  I would definitely visit again, on a sunny day, sit by the water, and have a pint and the calamari. \u00a0Mmmmmmmm!",

You're right they always are a bunch of clowns.\"   Him: \"No, seriously. A cable car FULL OF @#$%ing CLOWNS just pulled up.\"  I whip around to see 50 fully dressed clowns flood into the bar. \u00a0Hilarity ensued.   Pier 23 is a nice little bar / cafe which is one of those spots where you can sit out by the water and drink. They've got a pretty respectable bar and serve food as well. \u00a0 People always seem to throw group events here, and they handle it really well. You can get a big group for dinner out on the water and they manage to keep the place pretty warm on the cold nights.   Turned out the clowns were there for a birthday party too, so if you need a bar venue on the water that hosts clown birthdays, I know they've done at least one.",

Hubby and I order a couple of Bloody Marys, which were very good. They're unique in that the garnish is a little different and they have actual horseradish in them. Very tasty, and different which was nice. Ordered a couple of cups of clam chowder which came out in about 5 minutes of us ordering. I see a lot of reviews saying the service wasn't great, but ours was stellar. They were practically falling over themselves to make sure our water was full, dishes were cleared, everything was ok, etc.   The clam chowder was excellent, as was the little sourdough crostini that came with it. We opted to share an entree, had the fish &amp; chips. It was delicious as well, with a nice batter on the fish - not too greasy!

A popular tourist destination with a dive atmosphere, Pier 23 cafe has limited seating inside with a vast open outdoor seating area with a great oceanside view. \u00a0On a beautiful day with a significant other or a group of friends, any restaurant is sure to do well. \u00a0I arrived late to meet a group of 5 and it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to greet me. \u00a0  Albeit the initial slow service, I was itching for a bloody mary, and at $9 for a small glass, this didn't come cheap. \u00a0I was however, surprised to find a tasty green bean, cocktail onion and olive in the glass surrounding the extremely spicy liquid. \u00a0When we finally had the chance to order, the fish and chips sounded delectable and I wasn't disappointed. \u00a0@ $14 for the plate, this was about standard. \u00a0  Better service + more bang for your buck would have increased my rating by another star, but I'll come back here on a nice day to have another fine tasting bloody mary and try another great tasting seafood item.",

The menu may look sparse but each item (that my group had) was quite delicious. The sardine bruschetta was a wonderful surprise -- these sardines were not the salty little fish you expected but rather a larger, fresh piece on each slice of bread, accompanied by olive tapanada and greens. Everyone in the family happily had a segment of the appetizer.  Both mother and I had the mussels and clams. Garlicky, brothy, fantastico! Sis had cup of clam chowder and side field greens -- great salad and good (but very rich) soup. Father had the lettuce wrap -- a \"piece together your own wrap\" dish that was as delicious as the rest. Only bummer was they were out of crab while the surrounding Pier 39 restaurants had some. That said, we obviously walked back to Pier 23 after inspecting a few 39 places and greatly enjoyed the meal.  From the look at other patrons' dishes, the sandwiches/burgers were quite large. The sweet potato fries and sliders also looked popular with the under 10-years-old set.  If you're headed up to the City and Pier 39 to look at the sea lions with tourist friends/family, this is a good place to go. Plastic chairs, red-and-white checkered tableclothes, $1 oysters during happy hour -- good, casual, comfortable, friendly.",

Anyway, we just wanted to check the place out since it's supposed to be one of the coolest piers. The waitress seemed shocked by my request for hot tea.  \"What flavors do you have?\" I asked.  \"I don't know, we're really not a tea kind of place,\" she shrugged.  While I sipped my piping Lipton, I laughed when I saw an English couple at the table beside me enjoying mugs of hot tea, too.

Great place for big groups, but a no-no for people that do have kids. Sorry but when majority of the people in an office party have drinks, strong drinks (mind you), in their hand, the kiddes should be left home. The calamari, mussels, and buffalo wings were very tasty. I wasn't too impressed with their chips and salsa, because the chips tasted stale, but I needed something to munch on nontheless.   The music playing was definitely the vibe for the our group and generally sealed the deal that not only did we get the entire pre-dance floor area, but we even got all of us to dance in our intoxicated stupor. Another plus is two bathrooms for the ladies, although one is super small and requires you to practically stand on the toilet to open the door. And the promotion of having good loving sold in the vending machines in the bathroom for only 75 cents. Niiicccee.   Strong drinks. Decent food. Good music. Great location.",

    "review_text": "Been here many times before, and recalled having a solid 3 star experience: pretty good food and decent service, with great views. \u00a0The line for the women's restroom is generally a problem and not managed well. \u00a0For awhile, there was only 1 working toilet (out of 2) and the line was crazy long. \u00a0So some women were using the men's restroom, as it was empty...until the bouncer bounced women out of there. \u00a0They should have had a better plan for managing, like switching the women's and men's rooms. \u00a0But I didn't use the restroom yesterday, so I don't know if that is still a problem.  Yesterday, I made a dinner reservation for the first time (by phone). \u00a0When we arrived, there was no record of our res, but thankfully we got there before it was packed. \u00a0  Our server spent more time chastising us (for rotating the table so that both of us could see the water) than serving us. \u00a0She took our orders, dropped off our drinks and promptly left while I was trying to get her attention to bring me a glass for my hard cider, which she served in the bottle. \u00a0Never saw her again until she brought the check - literally. \u00a0The other server who dropped off our food, as well as the busser and a different server we flagged down were all helpful when we needed something, but I don't want to have to ask everyone else for favors because my server has disappeared. \u00a0  My partner and I mentioned to our server when we ordered that we were very hungry and would like to start with some sourdough bread. \u00a0A few slices came with our appetizers, which took 20-30 mins to arrive, even though it wasn't busy. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   Then there's the food. \u00a0The clam chowder was missing salt and tasted like heavy cream with clams and some sand. \u00a0I don't remember it being flavorless before. \u00a0Then I had the fish 'n chips, which had the saltiest batter I've ever tasted, and we couldn't finish it in spite of being so hungry. \u00a0The fries were good, though, so I ate those. \u00a0My husband ordered the clam/ mussel combo (which was good, as always, but not very filling), followed by the fish tacos, which were like tapas size. \u00a0So he needed to order a quesadilla to feel satiated. \u00a0  No one ever asked how our food was, so I am writing this review in hopes that someone at Pier 23 reads it and rights the ship soon. \u00a0Our dining experience was disappointing from start to finish. \u00a0We still had a good time because we were happy to be out together and were glad to enjoy the view, but the $100 bill (before tip) for a bad casual meal with one beer &amp; one hard cider (and no dessert) felt insulting.",

Overall we were both dying to eat so we devoured everything except for the copious amounts of french fries and agreed that the meal was OK. We both agreed that they did that thing that restaurants do sometimes where they don't actually know how to cook something awesomely so they just fry it or add lots of mayo, or salt and that was definitely the case here overall. As consumers of not overly processed foods, the meal left us feeling a little lethargic and bloaty.   Also the hostess was rude and was obviously annoyed when showing us to our outdoor seats because we didn't want to leave our roadbikes alone and sit on the patio (hey, they are NOT cheap) and just gave us menus and told us to go to the bar inside when we want to order, luckily a waitress realized we were getting lunch and served us for the rest of our meal. \u00a0  I would go back if I was with people who I know love heavy touristy food places and they were treating, but not again otherwise.",

Honestly, with the bay as your backdrop, nothing beats the feeling of having a cocktail in your hands, and the stresses of work floating away on the waves.   Unfortunately, most of the executive douchebags tend to have the same idea, so you often have the feeling of throwing them into the bay, along side your work stress.  On a less-sunny day, Pier 23 isn't much more than a dive bar. The inside is small and, in all honesty, hardly worth visiting. I'd much rather save it for a sunny day.",

Calamari + fries + chicken wings + beer  - 4 stars coz it just tasted greasy and heavy and then to have it all washed down with a cool beer was close to perfection  5. Fish n Chips  - 2 stars coz they spelt G.R.E.A.S.Y. You'd think on oil well exploded on them  6. Service  - 4 stars coz we were a group of 35 and the waitress was on top of getting orders, delivering them and running around and all this, with a smile  7. Bathroom - 3 stars coz the wait was not too bad and the bathroom was clean as a whistle  8. Crowd - 3 stars coz it was a mix of yuppy, preppy, biker, rastfarian, eclectic and some times drunk people  9. The View - 4 stars for being over the water, watching Coit Tower lit up, good company and nice music  10. The Bar - 4 stars coz he was good, very friendly and helpful",

It's larger than the inside and way more fun as all the conversations mix together into a gossip soup. Feel free to join a conversation at another table as they're probably going to do the same. But stay away from the walk of shame jokes, 50% of the people here are on it at the moment...   Go for a starter of a bucket of six Coronas at some steal of a price I can never remember because I follow it with an undisclosed number of Bloody Mary's. Then get the Huevos Rancheros. Seriously, they're the best in the city. At least I think so, who knows really...but they way I remember it, they're AWESOME!   Close it out by spilling something on your \"date\" and you have the perfect Sunday Funday Brunch! It really is a great place to wear your sunglasses and hide your bloodshot eyes while reliving the embarrassment of the past night. I miss it and the Heuvos Rancheros uncontrollably.

It was a bit windy and chilly and so the sides were all zipped shut, which made the area nice and comfortable.   We had a big group and made a reservation so seating was a non-issue. It was also rather quiet since we were there on a Tuesday early dinner time, which probably added to the non-issue for seating.  My biggest drawback was menu. The beer menu was pretty good. They had some great on tap options. Happy to see Deshutes on tap!   The food menu really made things difficult. They had large plate and small plate listed with price ranges that were similar for both. There was quite a variety between what each member of the group ordered with some large and small plates, but they all seemed the same for portions imo. They should've priced it per category since seafood is obviously going to be more expensive than chicken.  The menu organization was also challenging and the selection was low. The appetizers were kind of odd and the sides were a bit pricey for sides and they were also a little strange too.  I ordered fish tacos. They were pretty good. Heavily topped with peppers and tomatoes. The guacamole and salsa toppings were nice to have, but the flavor of the taco, while not terrible, was a bit bland. The salsa did have some spice in it, but it didn't round out the flavor of the tacos as much as I hoped.  I'd return! Next time, I want to try something non-seafood for comparison.",

The food was okay, I ordered the crab and shrimp sandwich which was like a crab salad and served with horseradish. Even though I love spicy food, I usually like to take a bite or two beforehand so I can gauge the flavor of it, I slathered it in horseradish after just to get some taste, it was pretty bland and if it weren't for the horseradish there would have been nothing.  Service was friendly enough but with what looked like two servers for the entire inside, enclosed patio space and the waterfront tables it was understandably hard to meet the needs of everyone involved. As a tourist I was not that impressed.",

We ordered clam chowder, calamari, mac and cheese, the peppercorn swordfish steak, and \"the cheeseburger\". Everything cooked perfected, tasted amazing, and we were definitely pleased with the service. We took 2 orders of clam chowder to go, that's how good it was compared to all of the other chowders we had tried on our trip! The front of the restaurant is the bar area, while the rear is quieter and has a lot more room for tables which is where we were seated. The parking is okay, its by meters or in their tiny lot. Everyone needs to step away from the tourist-y Pier 39 and venture on over to Pier 23 to come and eat here!",

At first I was hesitant because from the outside it looked a little small. Little did I know, once I got in, I realized they had two full bars (indoors and outdoors) with an inner room and a HUGE outer room right on the pier overlooking the sea. Guests also have the option to sit outdoors too.   What I ordered:  - Fish &amp; Chips: 4 stars. Loved the cajun fries and the crispness and tenderness of the fish. Expected more fish though because it only came with like 2.5 pieces. I'm obviously a girl with a big appetite.   - Crab &amp; Shrimp Sandwich: Definitely recommended! Everything was fresh and it was a good portion. You can also order fries or a salad along with it.   - Beers (Blue Moon and Speakeasy)   Overall experience:  Definitely blew me outta the water (ha ha get it? lol -_-). A restaurant right next to the ocean, with mouthwatering food, and alcohol? I'M SOLD. Will be back soon!   P.S. I love how their menus and their \"logo\" are naked girls from the behind.",

Our meals arrived and My wife's pasta was overcooked and the short rib was mostly fatty. \u00a0She had three bites and pushed it away. \u00a0I ate 1/2 of the sandwich. \u00a0I was hungry. \u00a0I opened the other half and found that this San Francisco treat was nothing but a Crab &amp; Shrimp Louie. \u00a0If she would have explained it, I would have been happier. \u00a0Where is Vera??? \u00a0I got a bus boy to bring the manager. \u00a0He came over and we explained the problems with the pasta dish and my sandwich. \u00a0He offered to take off the Pasta dish(very nice), he didn't seem so enthusiastic about mine. \u00a0I can understand, \u00a0not. \u00a0Paying customers are critical to success. \u00a0If it isn't right 100% do the right thing. \u00a0Where is Vera?? \u00a0He left and never followed up. \u00a0Looked up a few minutes later and he was at the bar eating something. Vera finally arrived. \u00a0I wanted to ask if she was out shopping or getting in a round of golf, but why mess up a good thing. \u00a0She never asked how everything was. \u00a0She asked if we wanted something else. \u00a0 NO was a quick answer. \u00a0We paid and got the hell out of there. \u00a0We walked down to Fisherman's Wharf and had a few drinks and some real good chowder. It amazes me how a place can serve garbage, have an inexperienced wait staff and provide horrible service and stay in business. \u00a0If I owned the joint. \u00a0New management, new wait staff and train the chef to prepare it the right way. \u00a0Show you care. Avoid this place at all cost. \u00a0Again I would give it a zero rating if i could.",

The only downside of our visit was that the service sucked. \u00a0I'm not even sure who our waiter was. \u00a0He might have been to hip to serve us or something. \u00a0He walked by about 4 times to help others before he stopped at our table and seemed to be surprised that we were sitting there.  Otherwise, food was very good, will go back.",

I imagine so, cause on a beautiful, sunny afternoon, it doesn't get much better than this!  The food is okay, nothing to write home about. \u00a0I seem to recall eating a lot of greasy food here - probably perfect when consuming alcohol, however!

    "review_text": "So the food here is um... kinda gross. The fried oysters are disgusting. The calamari was ok, the fries were probably the best thing we ordered. Also the artichoke hearts aren't just the heart they are the whole thing almost, with the leaves and stuff. I am pretty sure that the artichokes and the oysters came from cans and were then battered and fried. Luckily I had a gift certificate to here otherwise I would have been really sad to pay that much for such terrible food. Next time I come here I need to remind myself to order a burger.   Although maybe the food doesn't stand a chance anyways because the smell coming off the bay is pretty horrific at times. Couldn't tell if it was the cruise ship emptying their septic tanks or just the bay. Either way it wasn't pleasant.   But.... the outdoor patio is soooo wonderful when it's nice out. Get here early because it fills up fast. I will definitely be back here to bask in the sun with a few beers in hand.   Also when there's a band there might be a cover. On a Sunday evening it was $5. The band was good and fun, but very loud, so don't expect long convos if you sit too close.   All in all if you like drinking outdoors, then come here for the drinks, not the food.",

Pier 23 is a great place to get your Bloody Mary on, or whatever refreshing drink your prefer. If it is a sunny day and you are down on the Embarcadero, I highly recommend walking down towards Pier 23. The food is not bad - I have only split the appetizers. The decor is a little dive bar-ish and perfect for the location. On a beautiful San Francisco day, I could sit out on their deck until the sun sets. The drink service could be a little quicker but if you are just there for a drink - grab one at the bar first then snag a table outside. It will tide you over as the waiters get around to you.",
