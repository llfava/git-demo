    "review_text": "I'm so glad we conquered our 'we-can't-go-without-a-reservation fear!' and stopped in to The Square last night for dinner, anxious to try the new restaurant by the people who brought us Sons and Daughters. Just our luck: they had a last minute cancellation, so we were seated immediately around 7pm on a Thursday. I can hardly believe this restaurant occupies the same space as the former Bottle Cap! \u00a0The place now seems extremely open (they blew out that ugly wall), and the dark, dimly lit ambiance ups the chic factor of the somewhat touristy neighborhood.   We tried: - The pastrami spiced rillettes, caraway toast and mustard. This was our least favorite - way too salty, and we barely touched it. It was also topped with cornichons, so if you hate pickles...  - The delta asparagus, speck, and whipped whey. This was our favorite dish of the night! Our hostess recommended it, and even my gf who claimed she hated asparagus couldn't stop picking at the plate.  - The trout, braised baby fennel and new potatoes. The trout was cooked beautifully - crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside - and the new potatoes were very tender.  - The grilled sirloin bavette, spring vegetables, and wasabi. I did get one slice of slightly chewy bavette, but overall it was a solid dish.  - The beef tartare and salt &amp; vinegar chips. Beef tartare is pushing the limits of my culinary adventurousness, and I've only had it once before in Paris because, well, I was in Paris so I had to. While I still have a bit of a mental block preventing me from fully enjoying raw meat, the flavors of the tartare were outstanding and, dare I say it, better than my previous French version (mon dieu! mais oui!).  We opted out of the desserts, but what struck me even more than the delicious meal was the attentive, professional, polite, non-pretentious service .We never had to wait for water, we had many people asking us how we liked each dish, and we were even asked if we would like extra sets of serving cutlery so we could share the plates more easily.   Go for the food, stay for the service.",

Beautifully balanced neighborhood food, great cocktails and superb desserts.   Amongst my favorites are the Asparagus with speck, ginger beer cocktail, Roasted Crab and Rum Baba cake.   Neighborhood food that pleased both my Midwestern mother and my food critiquing friends. Interesting components combined with classic flavors. Yum!   Definitely get dessert at the end of this meal, you won't be disappointed! All too often a great meal like this is followed up by a boring, overly sweet dessert. All of the desserts here (and I've tried them all) are perfectly balanced, not too sweet and very well executed.",

    "review_text": "My fiance and I had a wonderful date at the Square last night. The space is really inviting and cozy, and I really like the paint color that they chose for the walls. The hostess was very receptive and sat us immediately. Our server, Anthony (I think?), was friendly and engaging throughout the entire meal. We started with a class of Sauvignon Blanc and their daiquiri. Both were very good. For appetizers, we got the oysters and the beef tartar. The oysters were presented in a really nice dish full of rock salt, and their champagne mignonette added a great flavor to the oysters. The beer tartar was SO good. I thought the salt and vinegar chips were a tasty and fun addition to the beef. The beef tartar itself was perfectly seasoned, and I'm glad that the onion wasn't overpowering like it can be sometimes. It was a good amount of food for an appetizer.   My fiance got the risotto, which was one of the best ones I've ever had. The barley and mushroom combination was perfect. I kept stealing bites the entire time. I ordered the seafood/broth/artichoke/bread dish. When it first arrived the mussels tasted a bit off, so we asked if they could take it back, which they did without any hesitation. The new dish tasted great, and the cod was by far the best part. We ordered two beers off of their pretty beer list, which is quite impressive, and were given complimentary dessert because of the mussels issue.   Everyone was so friendly and I liked how all of the staff had roles that brought them in and out of the kitchen. I felt like we got to interact with everyone working there that night. We will definitely be coming back!",

The Square was very good -- though still with a few kinks in service (we waited a long time for our check). The ambience was good, and we liked our food.  I was personally disappointed in the bread service. Despite the nice presentation, it tasted like a packaged dinner roll you buy at the grocery store. Also, can we have more than one? Appetizers: We got oysters, which were good. The other apps (beef tartare and asparagus) were good, but I the asparagus was lukewarm. Both couples order entrees to share -- we got the ribs and they got the dungeness crab. We thought the ribs were VERY VERY good. They definitely liked the crab. Dessert: We didn't order because we wanted the galette but we needed 30 minute notice for that...which no one told us about.  We live in the neighborhood, we'll definitely be back. Unclear if this will be a dining destination like Park Tavern...but part of me hopes it isn't so I can actually get a table there!",

    "review_text": "I was sad to hear Bottle Cap closed but excited that the space turned around so quickly! I grabbed a reservation for last night with my husband at 8pm. The place was definitely packed with a lot of excitement!  We were seated quickly at a table at the end of a row of 2 tops in the middle of the dining room. The table we were sat at was right in front of the kitchen door (why? just why, would you ever put a table there?). I completely understand trying to fill your restaurant as much as possible but I don't understand the logic of seating someone at what is clearly your WORST table in the house, in plain view of 4 other open 2 tops. Especially since I had a reservation...  We waited almost 10 minutes before our server came over...who was a bit...strange. We asked to be moved and we were...right in front of the server side station. Eh, ok, pick my battles at this point. Our drinks came after another 10 minutes but the new server we ended up with was great and less robotic and very helpful. She was the best part about this evening.  My husband and I both ordered their old fashioned that is on their menu. We both agreed they were good, nice presentation (1 large cube, lemon peel, etc) but we'd had better (and bigger) especially for the price tag. We decided to split a bottle of Triple Karmelite (750ml bottle) which was great. Good beer selection!  They were already out of 2 things from their tiny menu. We ordered the chicken liver mousse to start on the recommendation of the server. It was great, but nothing to write home about. I ordered the risotto - it was forgettable. My husband had the hen which was sliced. He was hoping it would be as amazing as the hen at Park Tavern and he was sorely disappointed. The 1 ounce dribble of sauce tableside was like something out of a bad foodie comedy. The portion was tiny (which I normally don't mind if the price matches) and dry.  We ordered desert - cheese for me, devils food cake for him. Again, both decently good but the teeniest of portions!  I do like that they charge a 15% flat gratuity (and are very up front about it!). We spent $150 for 2 people including an over 20% tip (we added to the auto-grat). Given this cost I think I'll go elsewhere.  I miss Bottle Cap. For the price and quality I am going to head to Park Tavern, if PT was afraid of the competition they shouldn't be.",

    "review_text": "Another disappointment at one of the best locations in North Beach. Why do people continue to ignore the long lasting successes in the neighborhood? \u00a0At least Bottle Cap had a nice young couple pursuing their dream.  Stopped in to the bar last evening to check it out. The draft beer menu is eccentric and overpriced. No Anchor Steam. A pint of Guinness is a $7 joke. If you like Guinness, walk 1.5 blocks to O'Reilly's where an imperial pint is $4 (happy hour price till 7 M-F) and they change the keg on average twice a day.  They add tax to your drink and a mandatory 15% service charge. The competition includes any tax in the price at the bar so you don't have to deal with a lot of small change. I normally tip quite a bit more, but not when it's mandatory. I'm comfortable with the old ways which have worked well for the 50+ years I've sat on a stool.  The remodel has an appealing look, but the high table that replaced the hip wall defining the bar is way too tight - kind of a coach seat feel. And removing the center wall gives a sense of openness, but greatly increases the noise level.  I predict this place will be popular for a while with the tourist and SOMA crowd, but if you want to rub elbows with your neighbors this is NOT the place.",

    "review_text": "Sons&amp;Daughters was one of my favorite meals that in recent memory, so I was excited to try out this new second outpost of their franchise.   The complimentary bread, fresh out of the oven, with homemade Strauss butter was to die for -- I think I had about three of them. The drinks were good -- I enjoyed their mezcal-based cocktail in particular. Appetizers were AMAZING. Their steak tartare was very well-seasoned and fresh, and I loved the contrast of flavors on their chicken liver pate dish with some strawberry jam on top!  The entrees, though, were a little less impressive. The bbq ribs were tender and flavorful, but I didn't feel that it was worth the price tag of a high-end dining establishment. There are bbq specialty shops that can do just as good, if not better, for half the price. I was hoping for a little bit more creativity in that dish.   The real problem was their pork chop -- it was perfectly cooked and juicy, \u00a0which is hard to do with pork, but the flavoring of it was just completely off. \u00a0Our first piece was EXTREMELY salty -- so salty that when the waitress came to check on us, we told her, and they sent it back to be re-made. When we got it back, the first bite was still very salty.. but subsequent bites were less so. We even got some hint of sweetness in one portion of the chop. Perhaps this has to do with their brine (or marinade?) not being evenly coated, producing saltier bites in some part and sweetness in other parts....  The service, which everyone complained about in previous reviews, was TOP NOTCH. Just like Sons &amp; Daughters, this was one of the best services I've had at a restaurant, and I felt that it made up for the lackluster entrees.  This restaurant has a lot of potential, with fantastic appetizers, and a great staff. I'm hoping that they start producing better and more interesting entrees...",

The bartender was very friendly and the ambiance is inviting so we decided to give the food a try.   We started with the pork and brown egg appetizer. The pork was a bit fatty, but it practically melts in your mouth. The roasted radishes really compliment the dish well and helps cut into the saltiness of the pork.   We then ordered the house made pasta and kale salad. Each dish was excellent (I particularly enjoyed the pasta) and came with some really good bread and butter. Although, I don't think the butter needed the salt sprinkles. The food is a bit pricey, and the portions are relatively small, but I left satisfied and not feeling \"stuffed\".  As far as the drinks are concerned, the beer selection is adequate with a few notable selections available. There are also some very interesting cocktails available.   The menu seems to still be evolving. I have high hopes that as this place matures, so will the details within the dishes. We'll hopefully be back in a few months to see.",

    "review_text": "Time: 8pm/61\u00b0F cloudy  Purpose: Doing a follow up of TS since I put them on the map month ago. At the time I was pretty much excited as it 0.8 mile from my place. So tonight I just wanted to mellow in and see what comes of.  Ambiance: It's loud in here even for a weekday night in middle of week. The noise level never change here because the structure of building was never touch, only the decorations. When it was Washington Square Bar &amp; Grill then Bottlecap the ground was the same level cement just different tiles. Sitting at the bar tonight was loud you literally have to speak about 30+db louder than usual. I don't blame the construction design as it was the same when the last two businesses were here. The structure now resembles that of a high end restaurant but with a casual attire setting. The 10 seat bar with highchair actually have a concave back piece that fells so good. It felt like I was sitting in a Recaro seat for a bar, hard to fall off. Two communal tables for larger groups and couple of high top tables near the bar area.The white brick tile design at the bar when looking at it making thoughts in your head that a brewery is on the other side. The rest of the place has is nicely furnish with chairs like the bar only shorter. Didn't like the idea of the restroom near the end of bar when going/coming back people turn their head to look at you.   Staff: I came in and was greeted by Christina young naive gal. Told me to wait a little til she can find something. I said it's okay I'm not here to eat just maybe a drink so the bar will do.  Cleanliness: Too new to say something yet, well kept just the front door debris left when wind picks up, minor.  Eats/Drinks: Steak Tartare w/salt&amp;vinegar chips housemade $14. Waited over 20 minutes for a tartare that's it's main purpose was to be served raw. I even ask if the egg was pasteurized didn't get an indefinite answer so I said what the hell you lived once, I'll try it. While waiting another guy pops menu open and ask me what I'm having tonight? I told him they have steak tartare here. He said me too! Tartare was okay but needed more seasoning to conceal that refrigerator beef taste. Was thinking it came out like a patty style like about 3-3.5 inches round instead loosely scatter pieces in a round form. Nicely cut into small piece and put together garnish with small drizzles or maybe vinegrette sauce. Not saying that it was old it shows fresh consistency bright red sticky looking with egg on top. I was worry that it might come out a little of red or brownish but it didn't and I can tell it was made to order. I kinda fork out a dab here and there put it on the chips so everything bite I would have a crunch as well as cold high end grade beef. I really like this dish but next time will try old fashion items as well as the tartare again. Got a ultimate palabra $10 to sip and eat lime juice tasted like the kind in a plastic green lime bottle. Tequila part was strong open my throat clears my mucus instantly.  Products: American fare with a twist,full bar,wine list. Salad,soups,burgers,fries,oysters,livers,seafood,\u00adguinea hens,desserts. Limited menu this week was just the first week of opening be patience there maybe something you like in coming weeks.   Punch Lines: Loud place,unusual american fare,full bar,North Beach/Russian Hill area,hard to find parking,little Italy,accessible by bus/taxi/walk/drop off,near chinatown/fi-di/wharf/,SF Giant's mural around the corner,park,cafes,bakeries,grocery stores,private parking lots,library,bike rentals,strip clubs,late night grubs etc.   Final Thoughts: Since it just open and usually I wait at least 3-4 weeks before trying any place out unless call upon. Tonight I was just being curious since I'm about 9 blocks away. Place was so loud when I left out the door I couldn't even hear the cars or people walking chatting among themselves. Ears adjusted after 2-3 minutes and I'm not hard of hearing or impaired from one drink.",

Right when we got our food, we ordered another meal for a friend who was coming to meet us. She didn't arrive for another 20 minutes or so, and even after she arrived, it took another half hour before her food came.

Now onto the food. \u00a0The complimentary bread lived up to the standards set by Sons &amp; Daughters - hot, fresh, and with house made Strauss butter. \u00a0For starters we got steak tartare, probably my favorite item of the night, and chicken liver pate. \u00a0Personally I prefer to spread my own pate, whereas this one is pre-spread for you.  The entrees were a bit of a mix bag. \u00a0My friend raved about their amazing ribs which were good but not mind blowing. \u00a0I'm not sure if they are really that much better than a really good bbq joint (which would probably have it for half the price tag). \u00a0The accompanying corn bread was amazing. \u00a0These people sure know their bread. \u00a0The last place prize though goes to the pork chop, which was ridiculously salty although the condiments were great. \u00a0The waitress checked on us and ended up replacing our pork chop. \u00a0This time was was less salty, but seemed to have an uneven flavor. \u00a0Our first piece of the new pork chop was a bit salty but there was other pieces that were a tad sweet. \u00a0  It seems like this place has a lot of potential but needs to work out the kinks. \u00a0Can't wait to try it again and see how things have changed.",

I think a better sound system would help that. I sat in the back by the windows and felt like I was on the moon. I had the sunchoke soup and the tater-tots. I wound up eating very little of it. The tater-tots seemed burned and the texture wasn't so much 'tater-tot' as baked potato with a dark crust. The soup was very bland. And where was this great bread other Yelpers are talking about? I 'm hoping this was just a one-off kind of night. I'll probably try it again with friends on a busier evening!",

    "review_text": "Like most reviewers, I think this place is great potential. They still have some kinks to address. Also, I should Say that I am a fan of the former Washington Square Bar and Grill. The wash bag had a certain comfort level, order a well-dressed cocktail and drop your cares at the door ambiance, that its followers have not re-created successfully.  The noise level on a Friday night was practically off the chart. I was struggling to hear my companion's words. It looks like the management is trying to address this with acoustic ceiling panels. Perhaps more are needed on the angled pieces of the ceiling as well as the upper walls. I think the overall din gives the restaurant a certain stressful environment. The hundred plus small lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling produced a muddy, amber light without much contrast or shadow.  Moving onto the food, the grilled peppers, with salt crystals, were fantastic and combined well with the manhattan. I ordered the kale salad with feta cheese which was more a feta salad with kale. \u00a0Half the feta would be very adequate in my opinion. The roasted beets had a lovely sweet tart flavor. \u00a0Many reviewers are raving about the little bread rolls. Yes, the bread does have a very high moisture content which makes it chewy and unique. I am not personally a butter fan; I'm kind of indifferent to the butter. Yes, the service was excellent.  I'm sure that I'll return. I just really hope there more acoustic panels on the ceiling which would make the dining room considerably more pleasant.",

    "review_text": "The Square seems to be following a disturbing trend in recent SF bar/restaurants--designed to be casual, neighborhood, grab-a-drink-and-a-bite places, but eager to provide no local charm and to price themselves out of being taken seriously in this capacity.  The place itself is very attractive. Because of its location, it has to be self-consciously intimidating to the fanny-pack set wandering in from Fisherman's Wharf. But, the effect isn't really SF-it's more of a SoHo vibe inside The Square. There's no regional connection to its very colorful neighborhood, at the edge of North Beach and Russian Hill.  Service was friendly enough, but slow. We sat at the communal table in the bar area and ordered $11-$12 cocktails from their menu that took 10+ minutes to arrive. Within minutes, a child with Matchbox cars was seated next to us, causing us to request another high table in the bar area. I believe bars and the bar areas of restaurant bars should be off-limits to children. At the very least, the hostess should avoid seating them in the middle of the space, where the maximum number of other patrons are subjected to their presence.   Our cocktails were overly precious and trying too hard. My \"Muddled Old Fashioned\" was small and flavorless. My wife's concoction at least had an overly boozy taste of tequila and mezcal. I think the cocktail program needs another look.  We asked for food menus and found a poorly conceived mash-up of unappealing items that toed the line between bar food and pretentious, again, trying-too-hard items that seemed anything but \"casual, sharable\" things for a \"neighborhood gathering spot\". A soup was listed as a \"sharable\" item. There was a $56 crab. A $69 rabbit (albeit on the \"feast\" menu) etc.   If this were a quiet restaurant with pleasant ambiance, I would get it. But, this is supposed to be a casual hang-out joint. It's loud and sleek. The bar is not the place for a $69 menu item. Perhaps a \"bar bites\" menu is in order?  We declined the offer to order food and got the check. $40 for three cocktails. The 15% included service charge was clearly spelled out on the tab. I don't necessarily have a problem with it, as I would have tipped 20% for our slow and slightly obtrusive service. But their reasoning is off.   They state that they want to provide a livable wage for their employees. Great! I support that. The way to do that is to set your prices appropriately to pay them that wage (which I believe they have already done). When you presume to make me tip a certain amount -- the service charge is also taxed, by the way -- that is all you will get from me, unless your place really shines...and The Square does not.  A quick walk across the park to Park Tavern is a much better call--similar nice interior, but infinitely less full of itself.  Incidentally, we went up the hill to Cocotte, sat at the bar and got a bottle of Cotes du Rhone, some Coq au Vin, mussels, a half of a rotisserie chicken a couple of sides to snack on and a couple of desserts (by this time, the three of us were hungry for a bit more than bar snacks and a bit less than dinner) \u00a0for about $110.  That's a neighborhood joint.",

    "review_text": "I was kinda bummed when Bottle Cap shut down, but The Square seems an awfully lot more promising. The place is finally open starting 2/27.  One thing that you notice right off the bat is that there are too many people serving you: - 3 people welcomed us at the door - 2 people offered us water - 1 took the order - 3 or 4 serve us the meal, and take the dishes away - 1 checked on our meal   Talk about attentiveness, I guess. \u00a0  We went in on a Sunday at 6pm, it wasn't too crowded. \u00a0Considering the place just opened, reservations aren't necessary yet, but I totally see this being a crowded spot, once the word gets out (thanks to reviews like these, of course).   Drinks:  The wine by the glass list isn't too extensive, so we opted for the cocktails instead. \u00a0We got - a hot toddy (hey its flu season) and Mame Taylor. \u00a0The Hot Toddy was alright, considering how much I drink it I'm a little hard to please on that one but they did use honey instead of sugar, and brandy instead of whiskey! The Mame Taylor was great!   Food: I'm a pseudo vegetarian, mostly outside my home. \u00a0The vegetarian entree option was a little too carby, though I would like to try it at some point in the future (Barley Risotto, with green garlic and mushrooms). Here's what we got: - Kale Salad, with ricotta and pistachios: omgahhh delicious and healthy. One thing that bothers me about salads at restaurants are that they don't make the leaves bitable (is that a word?). \u00a0I hate having to have a conversation with someone with leaves sticking out of my mouth, cause the salad needed to use the largest pieces out there. \u00a0So I LOVED this salad, small tiny pieces of kale, can be easily eaten with a fork, and did I mention delicious? - Steak Tartare (my friend's take on it) - tartar was really good. they paired it with salt 7 vinegar chips which was really yummy because the tartar itself wasn't very salty - Hen (my friend's take on it) - hen was great too. but tiny for the price. i also only got 4 small pieces of broccoli.  - Dessert (I obviously had dessert as my main dish to balance the healthy kale salad) - I got the Devil's food with grapefruit ice cream. \u00a0I'm still craving it, right now. \u00a0I was a little apprehensive about grapefruit ice cream, but I think it complimented the chocolate really well. \u00a0Plus, you can't really go wrong with chocolate. \u00a0Tip: the Galette (with rhubarb and pistachios) takes 30 mins, so if you're thinking of getting that, order with your main meal.   15% gratuity: I know this is a pain point based on a lot of reviews. \u00a0I'm conflicted on it - you either take it as tip included, but most of us would generally pay 20% and not 15%, but it seems a little silly to include a few extra bucks to make that 15% to 20%. Specially if you're splitting bills, that's like adding another $1-$3 to each bill. \u00a0On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, you do get served by a lot of people attending to you, so it's nice that everyone gets a cut of the tip, not just the main server. Oh well, maybe The Square can revolutionize the restaurant scene instead by actually paying the staff a decent wage, versus banking on the 15%.",

My biggest complaint about The Square was that they added a 15% service charge automatically to my check. I was alone and seated at the bar. So, they are forcing you to pay a base tip of 15%. This was calculated on top of the tax, so it's actually more than what is customary by some. I complained to the General Manager and he said that they split the 15% among their staff. BFD. What they do with my tip is THEIR business. The amount I tip is MY business. For the record, I normally tip 20%, so this is not about the money, but about principle.   Now, on to the food...(I hate reviewing a restaurant until they have gotten their act together, but since I came on to YELP to mention the tip, I thought I would review the food.)   I eat out all the time in North Beach and have been excited to have a new place open. I stopped by tonight and granted, it was their first night, but the burger was marginal. For the price, I expected better. Park Tavern, Original Joes and Tony's Pizza all have much better burgers and for less money.   I would normally give a place a few times before I write it off, but because of the 15% forced tip, I won't go back.",

There is a lot of passion about what they do, from the chefs to the food to the spirits and bar staff and the staff in general. \u00a0They really believe they are doing something unique there - and they may well be. \u00a0The Square bar area and offerings are special, some classic presentations with some new ones - but not superficially trendy or kitschy, they are doing some interesting stuff. \u00a0And the bar staff are flat-out Spirit wonks. \u00a0They have put a lot of thought into every facet of the restaurant in trying to create the appropriate vibe - good, fresh, interesting food, facilitating walk-ins and reservations, and keeping a certain 'energy' to the place. \u00a0I'm all in on The Square...  I stopped again for dinner and had some of the best lightly-creamed white corn soup ever, followed by pasta with lamb, cherry tomatoes, and fresh herbs. \u00a0All served with a fresh roll that came with a concoction of Strauss Creamery butter creamed with yogurt - which I am sure is healthier somehow but nevertheless tasted like frosting. \u00a0The coup de gr\u00e2ce for the visit though, even though I did not have it - one of the bar specials listed on the board was: \"Shot of Fernet &amp; Can of Hamms.\" \u00a0That's right, a can of Hamms Beer 'from the land of sky blue waters'... sheer genius...  In short, highly recommended. \u00a0The food, staff, and restaurant overall are just cool. \u00a0In truth probably too cool for yours truly, but that won't stop me from going there again...",

My family raved about the food, but my daughter ended up eating my Pappardelle Pasta because the lamb in her Cavatelli Pasta was too gamy for her. I did not care so much for the Cavatelli Pasta. l am rating The Square 4 stars because my family said it was one of our most memorable meals while in the City. Personally, I would rate the food 3 1/2 stars with service at 5 stars.",

They are no doubt rookies who just got into the restaurant/bar business, and they are PARANOID.   I am 26 years old, and a frequent visitor to bars in this area. I had forgotten my wallet, so didn't have any ID on me, and they refused to sell me any beer. Fine - totally understandable. I told my boyfriend to go ahead and get his beer.  It was about midnight, and no one else was in the bar except a visibly drunk group of 3. The proprietors were for some reason terrified that the police would charge in and revoke their alcohol license, and they watched my boyfriend and I like hawks.  After some time I absent-mindedly, out of habit, took a sip out of my boyfriend's glass. The man behind the bar pointed at me and SHOUTED, \"You need to get out. You shouldn't have done that.\" Even the drunk group of 3 were surprised at his tone. I apologized and left - for taking a sip of beer.   I can respect your decision not to sell alcohol if the customer doesn't have an ID. I can never respect your poor grasp of the circumstance and the sheer rudeness of your response.",

And to the first reviewer of this place, you probably shouldn't review a place if you hadn't even eaten there although you're extremely sweet for giving this place 5 stars.  Anyways, this place had a soft opening on Feb. 28th and their hard opening, I mean grand, today (March 1st). We showed up at 5:15 and it was pretty much empty. We were promptly seated at a nice table. I loved the openness of the place. I could tell how experienced the team was by just how already organized they were.   Food:  Beef Tartare with salt &amp; vinegar chips  Excellent, they really thought through this what could've been very underwhelming and boring. They didn't make the tartare all that salty, so the crispy and hardy chips worked really well with the well-seasoned tartare.  Pastrami Rillettes with pickles and mustard  At first, I thought the crostinis were a bit too hard then when spread the goooodness on it, it all made sense. It was a delicious starter.   Trout with goodness-that-I-don't-remember  Holy crap, the highlight of the dinner. The trout was cooked to perfection with great flavors from the sauce. I inhaled this dish and actually forgot what was in it but who cares!  Guinea Hen with sunchokes and broccoli  Another highlight of the dinner (am I even allowed to say this?). The vegetables were very delectable. The sauce really complemented and brought the whole dish together.   Rhubarb and pistachio galett, whole milk ice cream  This dessert will take 30 mins of prep time, so order it ahead. This was a great dessert. It really is what it sounds like although the salt made this dessert a whole different thing. Who doesn't love rhubarb anyways? Especially, if you can only get them during this time.  Devil's Food Cake, caramelized cacao and grapefruit  Yum! This is rather a small dessert, but it was packed with decadency and flavors! I loved this dish.  I really hope this place succeeds.. I could tell how much they've put into this restaurant.  I believe the chef Moriarty was working in the kitchen tonight, so I knew I was in good hand when I saw him.  Added notes:  I am not 100% sure if they added the 15% default gratuity to our bill. we ordered a total of 11 items (2 starts, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and 3 cocktails) and it came around about $140 total.. which is pretty reasonable? I should've double checked. I wonder if they don't automatically add the tax if your total bill is over an x amount..",

Service throughout the meal left much to be desired.  2. THE FOOD! It was awful. I couldn't even believe it. I ordered the potato hash. When it finally came out, the eggs were so cooked, they were like burnt rubber. The yolk was so cooked, it was like a hard boiled egg. The potatoes were so smooshie, they were almost like mashed potatoes. And the spinach was so overcooked, it was like slime.  I will say though, my friends' dishes were semi-ok, but still not the best. It was very disappointing considering I was very excited to eat there given all the buzz, but I will definitely not go back.",

First off, I'm a big believer that you can judge a restaurant by their bread...the bread here is ridiculously good. \u00a0Each person gets their own house made rosemary bread to start. \u00a0It's served warm, not too heavy, and pairs perfectly with the salted butter. \u00a0Last night they offered us an additional piece and we graciously accepted. :)  To start I would recommend the warm olives, beef tartare (when it's on the menu), and the kale salad (I'm not typically one to order a kale salad at a restaurant but this one is awesomely refreshing).   For entrees, the risotto with trumpet mushrooms is fantastic but I would say my favorite is the baby back ribs with polenta and the cucumber salad. \u00a0The baby back ribs are to die for and the polenta and cucumber salad were unexpectedly good sides.   Also - last night we tried the kennebec fries with garlic aioli. I don't believe they were on the menu the first time we dined but I highly recommend. \u00a0  So basically my conclusion here is: great neighborhood spot with amazing food and great service. \u00a0Happy to have them as a new addition in North Beach!",

Maybe the best part of the meal was the service. \u00a0Our server, Julianna, was such a delight; a great mix of humor, warmth, and attentiveness without being overbearing. \u00a0It's been a long time since I genuinely enjoyed my server so much. \u00a0(Coming from a person who used to manage restaurants, I can say this with quite a bit of conviction.)   I would say the 15% service fee is fair; they hold themselves up to a certain standard and to attract great servers, they need to be able to offer them something other places don't. \u00a015% is pretty standard anyway. \u00a0Most people tip between 15-20%; this just makes the math easy! \u00a0(Sometimes, the patron would make a calculation error and tip under 10% = not satisfied with the service, and it seems wrong to punish the service staff for silly math mistakes.) \u00a0I never understood why people got so up in arms about \u00a0calculating the gratuity % before or after tax. \u00a0If most people claim they tip 20%, calculating the tip after tax makes marginal difference. \u00a015% of the 8.75% sales tax is a measly 1.3%! \u00a0If you spend $100 and are bothered by tipping your hard-working service staff an extra $1.30...  The only thing is, I was trying to tip more than 15% but wanted the extra to go to our server, whom I thought did most of the work.  My husband works just down the street, so the next time he works late, I know exactly where to kidnap him to for dinner :)",

But all in all, if you are aware of the service charge -- it's a good place, good vibe, great service and good food. \u00a0 So it is definitely worth checking out if you are looking for a new place in North Beach!",

I came with one other person and we shared 3 dishes:  Gougeres, Fromage Blanc &amp; Chive ($8) - I normally love these, who doesn't like cheesy bread? This was filled with too much fromage blanc / cream cheese, and just too heavy and rich for my taste. We each had one of them and left the rest. I wouldn't recommend this.  Barley Risotto, Green Garlic &amp; Maitakes ($16) - This was the best dish that I had here. The risotto was made with barley, and it was creamy, flavorful, and not overly garlicky. I liked the mushrooms that topped this dish. We finished all of this - I would recommend getting this.  Whole Pan Seared Trout ($24) - Compared to all the other meats on the menu, this was the most inexpensive of the bunch. We weren't super hungry, so we passed on all the feasting dishes, which were $50 - $70. For being an entire trout, this was a pretty good value. The fish was fresh, flaky, and was stuffed with herbs / garlic. It was pretty strong on the garlic, but in general, it was a good dish.  Our entire meal (including 2 cocktails) came out to about $70. I did like my cocktail, but wasn't overly impressed with the food here compared to other places in the city. Maybe I needed to have come with more people to get a larger variety, or to get the feasting plates. I'm glad I tried this place, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again or recommend it to friends.",

The fish was a small portion and way over priced. They ran out of the ribs. Cheapest glass of wine was $11.   15% charge is odd.

It was Sunday at 1pm and the place was virtually empty. Walked out due lack of service. Hope you have deep enough pockets to keep this 'white elephant' alive. Good luck!",
