The sangria is amazing and is served in a cool personal oak barrel if you order the 750ml section. They have a great wine selection from Spain, Chile, and Argentina and the flatbreads are great (I recommend the one with feta cheese and honey). The ambiance is pretty cool (very Latin American) with Latin music in the background. The owners, Ramsey and Carlos, are always there and will treat you well. I will definitely be here on a weekly basis.",

A bar that specializes in Latin American wine that also serves tapas with a fresh flair for Latin American fusion, it's definitely a departure from a litter of dive bars and strip joints.   We came with a big group on a Friday night and enjoyed some sangria, Malbec, a variety of the empanadas, pastelito de carne, canoas de sancho, palta reyna and even left room for dessert, platanos creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The menu is fairly priced, food is delicious with good portions and customer service is excellent. Even with a small band playing Latin live music, it wasn't too loud to hold a decent conversation among each other. A true hidden gem off Broadway, Antologica Vinoteca is a must for those who prefer an elegant and quiet night in the city.",

Culinary bestie Sara P. and I finally had the chance to head over Friday after work before dinner in North Beach. \u00a0I arrived first around 5:30, and we were the only ones there for a bit. \u00a0Everyone who worked there was super nice, and when they didn't have the white sangria ready yet, they brought me a sampling of the red sangria, which I happily accepted (um, hello, who turns down sangria in general?!). \u00a0It was suuuper yummy and fruity, and even though I'm normally not a fan of red wine, I loved it and could probably have an IV of this every day (especially during work.. ahem).  For a quick snack, we ordered the Mixto platter, and we let them pick the three meats and three cheeses for our board. \u00a0We ended up with a manchego, blue and smokey gouda, and for the meats we had salami, coppa, and a truffle pate. \u00a0They came with sliced and toasted baguette, apples, and honey and mustard. \u00a0SUPER yum. \u00a0I'd totally order this again.. all by myself.  If we hadn't been having pizza for dinner later we would've ordered their flatbreads. \u00a0But oh well, this totally just gave us a reason to go back again. \u00a0You don't have to twist my arm for that!",

I realize that this is a Yelp review and I should accordingly spend more time writing about the quality of the wine (I enjoyed everything I had), but I think what makes Antologia stand out is the exceptional service, attentiveness of the staff, and the genuine passion that the founders have about making Antologia a successful establishment in North Beach. \u00a0The location is great (a short walk from a number of restaurants in North Beach) and the ambiance is very comfortable.   Ultimately, this is the type of place that is hard not to support / root for, and I will definitely be back. \u00a0I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good wine bar in SF.",

I would probably never set foot into this little gem if it wasn't for an organized event, but I am so glad that I have and I would return again and again if I were in the neighborhood, with or without the three handsome guys (but it would be much more preferable if they were in the picture).   We came here around 8 p.m. on a Thursday night, when we first entered, the bar seemed empty, but around 9 p.m. things quickly picked up and the place was buzzing with energy. \u00a0  The wine selection they have is very reasonably priced, am I really in San Francisco? \u00a0Because seriously, we paid more for parking than the price of the wine.  The bartender was very friendly and the service was very quick. \u00a0For the first round I ordered a chardonnay. \u00a0Though chardonnay isn't usually my top choice, but I figured, since we were at a new place, meeting new people, why not try it out? \u00a0  And I was pleasantly surprised, that even though it's a dry wine, it went down quite smoothly. \u00a0I also tried my friend's sangria and it was absolutely delicious! \u00a0The wine taste is barely, just barely there, it was like drinking a glass of grape juice with fruits, which was right up her alley!  The bar appears to have a reverse happy hour, because about an hour in, the bartender came by to let us know all the great deals they have. \u00a0I believe they have a few selections for $5 wine and beer, $5 sangria and mimosa, and their flat bread was also $5. \u00a0Though we didn't get to try it out next time, I am determined to taste their food as well when I return!  For the second round, I ordered a mimosa... You can pretty much have mimosa at any hour of the day... because who wouldn't want brunch for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snack? \u00a0The mimosa was good (because how hard is it to make mimosa?), but nothing special.  The bar definitely caters to a younger crowd based on the music they play on a Thursday night. \u00a0I cannot wait to see how things are here on weekends! \u00a0Plus, they have sangria by the mini-barrels, must put that on my list for next time as well!",

My husband showed up about 15 minutes later and we decided to give the place a try.  The wine selection was just phenomenal and it was tough making a decision but the server was very helpful as he tried to understand our preferences. My husband ordered the Argentinian flight and I ordered the Spanish flight and we shared the Bruschetta platter. OMG!! Possibly the BEST bruschetta we've ever had! Overall, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend Antologia to all wine lovers.

Ambiance -- call me crazy, but a place in this area that is otherwise completely empty except for my party of 3 on a Thursday night is kind of weird. \u00a0And as a Latin wine bar, why are they playing a Turn of the Millennium Top 40 Female playlist??? Mariah Carey? Kelly Clarkson? Spice Girls? I mean don't get me wrong, I enjoy rocking out to \"Wannabe\" and \"Spice Up Your Life\" in my car as much as the next person, but it was super out of place and kind of awkward here.  2. Wine -- subpar to say the least, and in glasses that are difficult to swirl and limit your ability to actually appreciated the \"nose\" and flavor of the wine. I am nothing near a wine snob, but honestly wish I would have brought my own $7.99 winner from Trader Joe's rather than be disappointed by all 6 wines in the Old World and New World flights. \u00a0This place is a wine bar for goodness sake! \u00a0At least have glasses that give the vino a chance! Oh, and that doesn't generally suck.  3. Food -- the Chorizo Fondue and plate of meats and cheeses were both good, but the empanadas were bland, greasy, and kind of soggy -- for sure one of the biggest letdowns for me at this place. I LOVE, LOVE, LOOOOOVE empanadas! \u00a0And these were a total bummer. \u00a0Dare I say I make better ones at home??? Oops! \u00a0I dared. I said it. And it's true.  4. Service -- remember how I told you we were the ONLY people in the place? Well apparently that made us unimportant and gave the two guys working there permission to blow us off and play on their phones the whole time. \u00a0Icing on the cake. \u00a0Over it.

My friend and I really enjoyed our dining experience, which was enhanced by Carlos' excellent service. This was a huge improvement over my last visit and I look forward to returning and trying more items from the new menu.",

    "review_text": "Broadway street is known to become all flashy when night arrives, so this was an unexpected hole-in-the-wall, low key wine venue to encounter upon!  Their focus was on Latin American wine, which ranged on places, from Spain, Argentina, Portugal, Uruguay and to Chile.   We did a flight tasting and the most distinct one that I tried and disliked because of the strong black peppery, clove taste to the red wine, was Portugal Proeza, 2009. \u00a0I can't really say that I was a fan entirely for all the wines I tried from the flight, unfortunately. \u00a0However, now I know that Latin American wines are very earthly, full of spices and flavorful in terms of taste.  They offer side food to compliment or balance the wines.  They have sangrias! \u00a0Quite a refreshment if you are passing by during the daytime!  Service was attentive and our server let us take our time.  The decor of this cozy place is dimly lit and with about four to five seating tables as well as a wine bar seating area upfront.",

We ordered a Jamon Serrano Bruschetta (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/antologia-vinoteca-san-francisco-2?select=hZ3xl-QlIShtDF3Z9FNA2g#9DZ1kVu1D_yBXPiBZJTtwQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/anto\u2026</a>) and a Figs a la Xerez flatbread (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/antologia-vinoteca-san-francisco-2?select=hZ3xl-QlIShtDF3Z9FNA2g#pqbMzVjEMFwexU_OYDtPcQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/anto\u2026</a>). \u00a0Wanting a wine flight, we asked the server the wines that would go well with our food. \u00a0He suggested that a Spanish and Argentine wine flight for us.

The previous ownership The Vin Club took the first step to reignite some culture on the Broadway Corridor. Now they have passed the baton and what has come about is certainly a move in the right direction. The new owners' enthusiasm exudes as they speak about how their vision for Antologia came about. The Latin wine selections are exquisite &amp; the food a perfect accompaniment for the diverse list of beverages. The size of the venue, decor &amp; bartop made w/ reclaimed wine crates give the space an element of coziness &amp; charm.  \"Unacceptable\" that the place is small a previous yelper writes? How much room do you need to sip some vino? And wine bars are not a new phenomenon in SF \"wine connoisseur\". If you don't remember the London Wine Bar or talked juice with Chuck of The Jug Shop then you don't know the history of the wine scene in SF.  These guys are new to the game and it will take some time to work out the kinks, as all new businesses in this industry do. Passion has become a scarce element in new business ventures in this City. It is refreshing to walk into a small business and see the ownership operating the entity with such love &amp; care. I appreciate &amp; commend your efforts, I wish you all the success. I will visit often.",

Everyone is very friendly and attentive. They honestly care that you are having the best possible experience from start to finish. Their knowledge of wines is ample, yet there are no elitist attitudes to be found anywhere. Striking up a casual conversation with the bartender is effortless.   Antologia is a wine bar that serves small munchies to mix with the beverages. It is not really a tapas bar and it doesn't try to be one. Their wine list features selections primarily from Spain, South America, and California. They also serve a sangr\u00eda that is great considering that the business has a wine-and-beer-only license.   The location is good: close to everything in North Beach and located very close to the intersection of Columbus and Broadway. As word spreads about this vinoteca, it likely will get much busier.  It's a great place to become a regular!",
