    "review_text": "Went here for my girl's grad celebration. Of course finding parking sucks around 10pm on a Saturday night in the city, especially with all the restaurants and clubs in this area. Took us about 30 minutes of driving just to find parking a couple blocks away (just a warning so you can give yourself enough time). Seems like a spot for party bus peeps too, when we went, a group about 30 people got into line from a party bus. If you're on the guest list, I'd try to get there early, like 10-10:30 to give yourself enough time to get in without having to pay the $20 cover (guest list closes at 11pm)  Once inside, music wasn't too shabby. I had a great time. Seemed like the music in the front room was a little better (more old school) than the back room, but of course the back room has so much more space. Never felt like I didn't have enough space to dance, which is good because the last thing I need is some girl's sweaty back rubbing against my arm. Drinks are typically priced, bout $10 for a Goose and Cran. Asked for a double shot of Henn for my girl and it was $14, but it was literally like half a cup of Henn. lol. Bartender in the front was attentive and worked fast.  Not bad at all. Would come back.",

    "review_text": "I was looking at a bunch of the yelp reviews before I rolled here this past Saturday night and most of them were from the early part of Winter, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  First, parking on Broadway was terrible. We weren't down to park and pay because we'd much rather use that money for drinks at the bar, and spent nearly 25 minutes looking for a spot. If you've ever been to the City, you know there's a buttload of one way streets, so this definitely took away from party time. There were a bunch of po (aka police) out, and hella meters on Broadway were blocked off. When we finally found parking it was nearly 4 blocks away. Now, I'm always down for a walk but -- ladies can back me up -- it is VERY difficult to walk up a hill IN HEELS and look cute...especially when you need to pee and you're not drunk enough to do it in public.  Guest list ends at 11 and since parking took a lot longer than expected (yeah, we were super annoyed with that situation), we didn't make it. On the plus side, there was no line by the time we conquered that hill. Cover was pretty expensive ($20) but we managed to mouth piece the girl and she let us in for $15. At the same time, though, the girl might've been a beezy because the bouncer, who was really nice, told us there wasn't cover since it was so late. I guess we'll never know...  I don't think there's a dress code. If there is, it's not strict. I saw some fool wearing a North Face jacket zipped up to his chin.  All the past reviews said the bathrooms were clean, and those were lies! The ladies room was a mess...hella mystery liquids on the floor, paper towels everywhere, and 1 of the faucets (out of 2) was broken. There's are some cushes for tushes though, so you can holla at that if your booty is tired of backing it up.  The DJ was alright. His mixing was horrible, the flow was awkward. He played artist blocks quite a few times (I remember 3 MJ songs in a row. RIP, homie). The dance floor is gigantic and the DJ does his best to keep it moving. The ambiance is similar to the club in Knocked Up, so if you're inner sexy Katherine Heigl or geeky Seth Rogen wants to come out, embrace it. There was a good mix of people and the vibe (other than one creepy drunk fool) was cool. Having gone with low expectations, it turned out to be a really good night. I don't think it's really worth the $20 cover so try and get in via guestlist. The fun factor would increase if you roll deep with your folks.  Last thing, their AMFs get the job done and they don't even taste bad!",

    "review_text": "When I was in elementary school I watched a movie about cattle stockyards. You know, those places where they house and horde to-be-eaten cows into a mass before shuttling them off to be butchered and devoured?   As I milled into Atmosphere I definitely felt like one of the cows being pushed into an assembly line. Sealed on lock step, being pushed by a gruff and relatively unfriendly bouncer, I expected to be led into a slaughterhouse or an interrogation chamber where I would be repeatedly asked for my papers or the location of the rebel base.  Okay, that's a bit much. But seriously, Atmosphere is a horribly packed venue. Dancing when only the downstairs is open is remarkably impossible. The practice of doing anything other than stepping left, right, and just wedging yourself against six other people is literally like an interview question I got at Google once. And much like the Google question I got, it's really hard to come out on top. NP-Hard in fact.  The back bottle service room is better and bottles at Atmosphere are comparatively cheap. But the \"ambiance\" is a little lacking, given that the last time I was there the guy at the table next to me just started wretching with the full desperation of someone who called poison control after they swallowed something like weaponized ebola. What's worse is that homie was exploring the contents of his stomach for nearly twenty minutes until the waitresses and the bouncers decided to escort him outside. It was kind of like watching a race car crash on Nascar.  Look, I'm sure Atmosphere isn't a bad place per se. I'm sure if you're blacked out drunk you might have a lot more fun getting hot and moving 3ft/hr on the dance floor. But I don't like rolling to places where I have to kill a can of pre-ban FourLoko before I'm something similar to enjoying myself.",

Upon entering - Atmosphere is a pretty big club with multiple dance floors playing various types of music in each room. They have multiple bars and the drinks are standard. The crowd can vary from casual to dress to impress - once the bouncers start letting people in they pretty much let anyone in and the crowd can get really sketchy.

The only reason I am not giving Atmosphere five stars is because, well, the music was still not quite right. \u00a0The DJ was really sweet and friendly, though! \u00a0But he played a lot of remixed stuff and techno which was sort of Pop/Top40 but not quite; and he barely played hip-hop. \u00a0Fortunately, most of my friends were too drunk to care. \u00a0The DJ was also missing a mic so, no birthday shout-out for me. :( \u00a0  Other than that, no complaints. \u00a0Thanks again, Bennett and Atmosphere, for making this birthday the best one yet!!",

However, I will say what yelp reviewer \"Jennifer C\" is too polite to say lol! \u00a0Those \"aggressive, ghetto gropy\" guys she complains of were all black dudes. Of course no one would have been complaining had they both looked like and had the bankroll of, say, Kobe Bryant or someone like that. And neither would I. The fact is, I like black men because I'm not self hater, but maybe the combination of the incredibly profane and sexual music and the way the club is ran by management brought out the worst in everyone's behavior. The club knows exactly what it is doing. The idea I got was that the horny guys who come from all the titty bars are welcome here to close by the end of the night. There is really no other reason to totally ignore their \"cocktail attire\" strictly enforced on their website by letting poorly dressed folks come in, black and white; and have the DJ repeat songs that reiterate \"f**king and sucking\" all night long. There were some nice songs that played in between the ratch but it just seemed out of place at that point. Honestly, the vibe of the guys there was definitely too aggressive. Funny thing is, no one really groped me or harassed me because I look like a huge \"B\", which works for me sometimes. I love to dance and felt I couldn't get room to effing breathe let alone dance. If you're gangster and not easily shook then come here and get ratch because that's exactly what youre gonna get lol. If you're afraid and easily intimidated by 'urban' men lol, go somewhere else where you'll feel better and more secure.

(Only 12 did the actual drinking from the bottles though). \u00a0And just our luck that night they had a special of $5 Belvedere cocktails from 10-11pm, so my non-table service friends were able to enjoy themselves just fine! The DJ was great that night. \u00a0They had a special video DJ event going on where they projected music videos onto all the club walls, which created an awesome atmosphere (no pun intended). \u00a0The DJ played a great mix of old school hip hop and current top 40 hits. \u00a0It was awesome! I think the best part was that it wasn't overcrowded and you could actually move through the dance floor and have enough room to truly break it down!! And, oh did I get down... ;)  All my friends were raving about the club the next day. \u00a0I've been to my share of clubs around North Beach and few have service as good as Atmosphere's. \u00a0The music, the club staff, the drinks were all great and my group left very, very satisfied. \u00a0We didn't have to deal with douchey bouncers nor were we packed into the club like sardines. \u00a0So contrary to all the 2 star reviews you see below I give Atmosphere a stellar rating. \u00a0I highly recommend coming to Atmosphere with a large group and getting in contact with Karen King the next time you go clubbing and want VIP service. \u00a0It definitely made for a memorable birthday, that's for sure....Cheers!",

We came early to avoid paying cover. It was free with guestlist before 10:30pm. At 9:45-10:00ish, there was no line so we got in easily. As it got later, the club got more packed and the line got longer. Some of my friends had to pay $25 cover because they arrived a little after 10:30pm but they said the line was moving.   This place has two bars, one when you first walk in and the other one is upstairs. There's also a small room on the right for bottle service tables. So there are 3 separate areas for you to hang out at. It's not a huge place but it's decent-sized.   The bartenders were also nice. One of them charged us an extra $3 by accident and we honestly didn't even realize but he owned up to it on his own. He even offered to give us 2 more shots of what we had ordered to make up for it. That was not what I expected but I am definitely grateful for that!  It was a fun night at Atmosphere and we loved dancing the night away to the hip hop!",

When going to a club all I really care about is the music and the crowd: crowd was friendly and diverse, and the music was good and there was a lot of dancing for everyone. You don't go to North Beach anticipating lots of parking and squeaky clean establishments (it's the freaking red light district!), you go for straight up partying. Guys should prepare to pay cover if not on guestlist (was $10 last night). There was no line at 10:30pm on a Friday night, and plenty of room to move around.

Sure, I've been here on more than 4 occasions, but that was only because I've had bottle service discounts from my cousin who knows the owners.  The drinks are reasonably priced, but you have to ask yourself if you're willing to spend less on drinks for a ghetto crowd. \u00a0As for bartenders, look for Brenda...she's my homegirl who's not only hot, but makes it a point to get you tipsy.",

The bartenders are OK, the drinks were strong, but the atmosphere at Atmosphere left something to be desired.  I'm sure there should have been more than just the one crowded area for dancing, that was roughly the size of my living room. After watching several strings of men hitting on, and trying to dance with many girls, it just got tiring.   If being molested by creepers is up your alley, then perhaps you should come here. Though, the club pretty much clears out around 1:15, closing around 2. Probably a good idea, considering all the other clubs around the area, cater to those of the male population who believe violence is the answer (that means they all went outside to fight about whatever they were angry about, probably someone made a snide comment about their haircuts, or stepped on their shoes, y'know important stuff)  The staff (bouncers and coat check) are rude, they yell about almost everything, \"Don't lean on that post, even though it's holding our building up\" \"Don't put your drink on the one table we have in the dancing area, because someone might use it to smash someone on the head\", etc.  Apparently this is where sloppy drunks come to fling their alcoholic beverages, because I got about three drinks spilled on me. This makes sense considering it's the party bus's go-to venue, and drunk people cannot hold their liquor (that's funny, ahahaha punny)",

The long line outside Atmosphere is not a lie, it's equally as crowded inside. \u00a0The upscale feel is instantly lost or inadvertently ignored as your eyes are first drawn to the raised platforms with the dancing girls, and then to the mass of writhing bodies on the main dance floor. \u00a0Looking for the single 20s and 30s crowd? \u00a0This is your spot. \u00a0There are many pockets of seemingly single ladies here. \u00a0My friend quickly picked out an attractive girl in a group of three and started talking to her. \u00a0Shortly he came back to report that \"her breath stank\". \u00a0lol. \u00a0Lesson here is, always pack gum when you go drinking.  The bar is crowded but the bartenders are efficient, you'll get your turn to order within 5 minutes. \u00a0The alcohol was flowing as we took turns buying each other rounds of gin &amp; tonic, raging bulls, and Grey Goose shots. \u00a0At some point the bartender, while pouring an order of Grey Goose shots for another group, slid me a shot glass and pours me a freebie. \u00a0I realized how messed up I was when I looked down at the clear liquid swirling in the shot glass and felt both happy and sad at the same time. \u00a0It was like Sweet Free Shot! ...but Ugh...I'm staring down the barrel of drink 12, or was it 13, or 14? \u00a0Nevertheless, to show my appreciation I downed it like a champ and melted back into the crowd.

Thanks for helping us with our reservation &amp; for taking good care of us.  The music was on point, the drinks were good &amp; all the ladies had fun. The only downfall was that there was another VIP booth next to us full of guys (it was a bachelor party) &amp; they kept bugging all of our ladies. Karen &amp; her staff were kind enough to check in with us &amp; to keep the crazy boys away.   We will be back!! Thanks again Karen!",

    "review_text": "I haven't been to Atmosphere for a while but I used to go there all the time. From the sound of these other reviews, it's gone down hill.   I always had a great time at Atmosphere and never had any problems getting in. I guess it helps to know someone but even when he wasn't around, I could usually slide right in and not be harrassed by the bouncers or ticket girls. IT ALWAYS MAKES SENSE TO CHECK AHEAD FOR GUEST LISTS. Just a rule of thumb people, if you bitch about the cover or that it's too long a line, then you didn't do your homework!   I went to Atmosphere from the very opening, so I've seen them throw a good party but yes, from time to time the crowd will still be lame. Here's a tip: The later you go, the more crowded it will be but also the better the party vibe.   The front of the club is for lounging and for more low key chillin, thus the bartenders are also more low key. The back of the house is where the party's at. The bar is plenty big and they have plenty of bartenders so just keep it together or else pay for bottle service and shut up.   The DJs are mostly your run of the mill Top 40 guys/girls but there's plenty of room to dance and people watch. For some reason, this place attracts a lot of skeezy guys so, girls, watch your backs.   The bathrooms are nice and big and BONUS - they have a bathroom attendant. Don't forget to tip the attendant, they have to smell your shit all night!   Occasionally, there will be a big name roll thru for a short concert/appearance. So it's worth checking out the events.   Overall, I have never had a bad experience here, but maybe I'm blessed... Check it out, I'll be back soon!",

The music wasn't always the best during some parts of the night, but it's better then other places i've been to. Also the crowd wasn't rowdy like other clubs so I can't really complain about Atmosphere. \u00a0I'm glad I didn't experience the bad service that other people have mentioned here. \u00a0I guess it may just be a hit or miss for some folks.

But it gave us a good chance to see the place for what it was. Great sound system upstairs that isn't overbearing with another spin table downstairs. One of the owners was nice to come chat with us on the slow night and offered us VIP passes to come back on a busier night. We took him up on the offer, and it was busier, but still slow. Great music though. Great bar and stage upstairs and a roomy dance floor. Nice mixed crowd. Has a lot of great potential. No website up yet so its pretty hard to get on a guestlist. Part of the drawback is probably cover. Will come check it out again in a couple of months once they're a little more established.",

There was a black velvet curtain shielding the actual club from the outside and where to pay cover so i had nO IDEA what was in store. the four of us came late so after we got our IDs checked, we walked up to the lady who was at the window to check VIP/cover. She was SO FUCKING RUDE.. She said cover for ladies is $10 and $20 for guys. Then my friend said POLITELY, \"oh we're on VIP guestlist.\" Then she then looked at us up/down, scoffed and said, \"Uh. You' guys are not on VIP,\" in a super fucking high maintenance bitch ass voice pretending she was princess of the fucking booth looking down at her peasants or some shit. Then my friend said to look up his coworkers name on the bottle service list. Then she talked on her walkie talkie shit and then yeah GUESS WHAT? NO COVER. the look on her face when she had to stamp \u00a0our wrists was TOO GOOD.  anyways, i flicked open the curtains. ..... OMG THANK GOD WE DIDNT PAY COVER. i would have been so mad if i had to. There was probably no more than 25 people in this entire club and thats me being generous. THe bottle service section that was roped off had three tables and SOOO TINY! oh my goodness. My friends coworker had 2 champagne bottles and unnamed tequila in a bottle that looked like a bigger version of the Martinellis apple juice. The people that were there were ookay,,, some nice people watching actually LOL. the crowd is mostly white and black. mmm not that many cute guys? \u00a0Dance floor was pretty small, there is an upstairs/2nd floor that they set up but they didnt even open up. Bathroom stalls broken but there is a nice lady that gives you paper towels when youre done washing \u00a0your hands.

Tons of cops in the area so for the females it does make you feel fairly safe. While waiting in line I did appreciate the employees checking in line for anyone on the guest list. We got stamped and didn't have to worry about running late. Downside of the line, it was cut into 3 different lines. Which could have been ran better. All lines were ran by 5 giant bouncers who decided to serve the line with the girls wearing the least amount of clothes. After waiting patiently we get searched and we go in. The place is packed, non danceable :( its a large venue and decorated elegantly. We make our way to the busy bar up stairs and attempt to order a drink but had no success. 4 bartenders, 3 all trying to figure out the register and 1 trying to serve. After getting skipped over one to many times we decide to head out. The music in this room was top 40 ten years ago so we thought there might be hip hop in the other room, I suppose Erykah Badu is hip hop enough for that crowd. Disappointed we all headed to a bar.",

It was also fleet week and there were marines/sailors in uniform all over the place on Broadway - that was a pretty fun experience to see them all over the place.

Patrons are your usual 20 to young-30's crowd, leaning towards Asian and Hispanic, with a sprinkling of everything else. \u00a0It can feel like a high school dance at times, with groups each doing their respective interpretive dance of circle jerking. \u00a0On the plus side, if you're pressed for entertainment, watch for drunk chicks spontaneously deciding to get up on the tiny \"stage\" and do whatever it takes to get some attention. \u00a0I'm wondering how Atmosphere has yet to bear witness to a big-boned attention whore snapping a heel and careening off stage onto some unfortunate SOB. \u00a0(Oh well, at least the victim's end would be relatively quick.)  The club venue itself pretty much opens up with a smaller dance floor and bar to the right, leading to a short flight of stairs to a larger dance floor. \u00a0The smaller dance floor gets really crowded, and the bar doesn't help; because there's no designated dance area, drunk dancers are prone to bumping into you and spilling drinks over everyone and their mother. \u00a0  The larger dance floor has a bar to right, and restrooms in the back. \u00a0Honestly, Atmosphere could do without the restroom attendant...I feel weird that patrons are tipping a guy to stand there all night and suffer through the continuous sights, smells, and sounds of piss, vomit, and shit.",

The mirror is great; especially when you watch people run into them (just like multiple reviews said).   Music is great, the crowd was better looking than I realized. Maybe it was just the group I went with or the promotion company did a good job but this place is nice.  The only downside is how ridiculously HOT and STUFFY this place is. Had it not been for the huge dance floor, this easily would have gone down to a 3 just because it's got the worst ventilation system out of all the clubs I've gone to.   Other than that, good job Atomosphere.",

    "review_text": "My friends and I were lucky to find this place. We were originally gonna party it up at Bubble Lounge, but since it was a Thursday night, the crowd was old, like they just go off work, and the dance floor downstairs in the cave was closed so we left right away. One of my friends suggested we try Dragon Bar on Broadway, so we walked over just to find that it was closed! However, there was a line out the door for this place called Atmosphere that was right next door. We looked at it, contemplating whether or not to go, when these two asian promoters came up to us asking if we wanted in. We asked for the cover price and it was $20! EFF THAT. I used some smooth talking with promoter, saying we had nine girls, of course you can let us in for free and give our guys a break since we had so many girls. He offered us girls free admission and guys $10 each. Not too bad since we also got to skip the ridiculous line.  When we got inside, they just opened up the second floor dance floor and the music was poppin'!  Too bad I don't remember much of the night.....just more a reason to come back again to check it out :)  Final comments: Large dance floor with a great crowd and great music. Just try to get on the guestlist beforehand to hopefully escape the cover or go with a lot of girls.",

The down stairs is kinda cool, kinda weird. It's got a pool table, but I don't really know if people used it. And the DJ down here sucked. About an hour later they opened the upstairs, which was much better. The DJ spun well, and we were able to sit behind him. It was funny to see him kick people off the stage for dancing too hard or annoying him. I'm thankful he let us sit there though, I was suffering from a hangover from the night before so I wasn't drinking (I was the designated driver) and didn't feel like dancing much. Thanks DJ!! Oh plus, his GF was up there and she was really sweet talking to us. ;D",

We showed up at the club close to 11pm and the line just went by- none of that holding you out in the dang cold when the club is actually empty. \u00a0Of course it was a dub to get in though- nothing out of the ordinary.

    "review_text": "I like this club. Although I went on a slower night, which happened to be a Saturday, I was really feeling the music on both floors. The first floor started out as techno/house music and for a portion of the night turned into reggae. Sounds strange, but they made it work. The second floor was hiphop mainstream and some oldschool 90s R&amp;B! I felt like it was all me. My friend wasn't feeling it tho, because our musical tastes are different. But whatever, I loved the music! I also really liked the decor. And in a way, it was good that the night was not so busy, because at least me and my friend were able to sit down in the lounge areas, which I assume are usually reserved for VIP. I think the drinks are a good price, not too expensive. One of the bartenders was cool, or should I say semi-bartender, because I did not really see him serve drinks, but more clear drinks off the table. He would start dancing on the dance floor, which is great, because I think bartenders or semi-bartenders should be able to mingle with the crowds on the dance floors for at least a lil bit. And hats off to Linda who was working in the girl's bathroom, because she is super sweet. I hope to come here again on a busier night to see what's up, because I really like this place.",

I was already faded by the time I got in so I didn't need a drink anways, so I can't rate them on their drinks.

We assumed it was still early but the place was still pretty empty for the remainder of the night.   It was a nice place -- two stories, hella spacious and drinks weren't too bad. The bummer is that it would have been better if the whole place was filled up with people. The whole bottom floor was empty besides when people wanted to order drinks, because the bar's located on the first floor.   I guess the place to be was upstairs because by the end of the night it seemed pretty packed. So much ghetto-ness (not that it's a bad thing) going on on the dance floor though. Then there were gogo dancers and when they were done, random girls started dancing up there. As for music, there were a handful of songs that you just couldn't dance too, like rock music for example, so that was lame.   FYI: Hella creepers!! They are on the prowl!

I get in the shower to wake up, but was merely watering my sack of flesh of a body. Still feel like crap. Eff it I'm not going. \"Where are you!?!?\" \"in the shower.\" \"Whaaat?\" But my friends are persuasive people...2 separate offers to pay my cover and buy me a drink, wait for me and share a taxi...the only thing that could've beat that offer is if they just came over and finished bathing and dressing me too. Fine ok, cold shower it is.  We roll up, hop out of the cab and into the line of 10 people. The harbinger of the night was lying in a puddle of his own puke in the alley. His buddy next to him on the phone doing a bad job of babysitting. We get in, it looks like what I remember, dark. It wasn't too crowded but decent. I go find the rest of my friends and they all have that glazed twinkle in their eye and start oversmiling and slurring at me. Apparently not only did we miss the free cover, but an open bar too. Say whaat? It probably was a good thing because from what I hear it was a barf fest about an hour later outside: one of said friends got kicked out and started puking on the sidewalk. Then soon after, a group of girls joined him and started puking together in unison. Think: Bellagio fountains.  As I hit the dance floor, I get shoved and spill some of my drink because the security guards are all rushing somewhere. I run toward the action and see some girls getting escorted out. Apparently a fight in the bathroom. Eh, back to dancing. Talking to my friend, and some drunk-ass knocks my jack &amp; coke so that it splashes all over my friend's white shirt. Oh my god, it's not my fault!! It's cool, he's too drunk to be angry. Alcoholism isn't always bad.  I had a surprisingly good time. I know it was a fluke because of the open bar but I like when crazy ish happens. Shit-faced people make me laugh. There were also a lot of bored-looking Hasians in really short skirts dancing with each other but constantly looking around the room for the guy with the most expensive rice rocket to approach. And also a lot of dudes standing on the sidelines not dancing and \u00a0creepily watching the wannabe strippers that are dancing on that mini-stage near the wall. There were a handful of wrist grabbers who can't take a hint, and the obligatory group of amateur breakdancers who never dance with chicks. My favorite is watching the mounters attach themselves to my unsuspecting girlfriends and watch them get bucked off. Poor guys. Also, I am often victim to the ghost dancer who apparently had been dancing with me for the past 10 minutes but I had no idea because he managed to dance right up on me without ever touching me. So basically this place is a typical club but thank you for the open bar and good time.   P.S. Don't be a cheap-ass just because it's an open bar. Tip well. The bartender told my friends that they were the only people who treated him well so he hooked them up.",

    "review_text": "I went to this place for New Years Eve and my bad experience with this club started right off the bat. I was part of a large party that had a 20 person bottle service table for the evening. My experience in line was pretty terrible as the bouncers were extremely rude. One of my friends was not part of our table, but bought a normal open bar ticket. I explained to one of the bouncers at the front the situation and asked if she could come in with us and skip the line because she was with us. We were told to go to another person to get her wristband and then come to the front. While doing this, another bouncer came over to me and yelled at me to get in line or get lost and threatened to take my wristband away if he saw me again. This was completely uncalled for, especially since I was doing exactly what I was told by another bouncer.  Now if your party spends A LOT of money to get a bottle service table, you would expect to be able to use your table for normal table things at a nightclub. This club would not let anyone else to our table that was not part of our party. So if you met someone else at the club and wanted to invite them back to your table for a drink, you couldn't. That is absolutely absurd.  Also, the floor around our table was SO slippery that 3 people slipped and fell really badly.  The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the waitresses for our table were extremely nice and friendly. They took great care of us and I just wish the rest of their staff showed us the same hospitality.  Overall, I would not recommend anyone getting bottle service at this club let alone pay a pricy cover to get in here. There are much better clubs in the area than this.",

But this place is where all the boys come, a complete sausage fest. Seriously, walked up to the upstairs room and it was scene of a middle school dance, all the boys lined up to the wall. Oh the good ole days of boys, yes BOYS, coming up to you and grinding your booty like they got a claim. Um, yeah I wasn't even skanky enough for that action and it still happened.

The place itself is nice, good location, but the people were SO TRASHY AND GHETTO!!!! After they opened it up to the public at midnight or so at LEAST six people from our event (myself included) had their phones stolen. And these are just the ones I have heard of. DO NOT GO HERE you will get robbed of your phone, money, credit card or something. They obviously have a problem with thieves praying on people who are just trying to have a good time and they are not addressing it. I tried to call multiple times and never got a person on the line and never got a call back from my messages. I've filed a police report naming the venue as well. It's embarrassing for a club in San Francisco, I expected better and I am from LA. This is all aside from the way-too-aggressive ghetto guys groping me the entire time, it was disgusting, I needed to shower afterward. I had to drink just to feel semi-comfortable, and I never felt safe, for good reason obviously. They need to raise their standards for who they let in or they're going to be relegated to entertaining cultural garbage and not attract normal people.

Coming through on a party bus with the wrist bands on with a group of 20+, the bouncers sure know how to accommodate us in the line.  It was about 10:30 and got it with an ease with those wristbands. Of course no cover charge so that was a plus! Well, got in and it was so empty in there they were just holding the line plus it was still early i suppose. The bar was small downstairs and the upstairs dance floor was huge but they closed it off because it was \"early\" so only the bathrooms had access there.   Drinks are decently priced with a $10 min credit card charge, so not bad at all.   After around 11:15 the crowd started forming and they finally opened up the place and people migrated. The DJ was pretty good spinning top 40 and a few other slappers, but the crowd was just alright.   Towards the end of the night tho, damn it got GHETTO up in there. all this dudes tryin' to \"function\" and broads whippin their hair all over the place tho. NOT crackin. You can get hyphy and everything but whippin your hair is just gonna start a fight  Last but not least, thank you to the nice asian dude in the bathroom that served the dudes, much appreciated!",

I remember losing my flash diffuser for my camera, and coming back to ask one of the bouncers, and he had recovered it, stored it, and gave it back to me, which I thought was rather nice. Inside, there is a huge fish tank which featured the elegant fish from Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo. I've only experienced the bottom floor subdivided into two areas. There's a pool table. Smell? All I smell is Atmosphere.   DJ plays Vintage Hip Hop &amp; R&amp;B, Rock, Electro with club anthem mashups &amp; remixes.  I've met the regular DJ's, bartenders, security and I believe one of the owners- they were all cool.   I would though like to make it clear that I primarily came to the venue for the Tuesday - no cover promotion. Only a couple times I went on Fri/Sat and this place would get jammed-packed.

We were on the guest list and were told the same thing: free Patron and free entry before 11. \u00a0We were made to wait in line outside for *one hour* despite getting there early. \u00a0 Half an hour into it, a staff member wearing orange made the announcement to the line that they had now decided to start charging $10 for admission. \u00a0Some people left on principle, understandably miffed at being lied to, and others stayed... we decided to stay.  After an hour, we were finally allowed in, only to discover that we were waiting this whole time for a mostly empty venue (unsurprisingly \u00a0-- we'd all been to places like this before). \u00a0The bouncer ushered us toward the cash taker: \"that'll be $15\". \u00a0Confused, we explained that a guy outside in an orange shirt said the revised cover would be $10, not $15. \u00a0We were told smugly by the bouncer that \"there is no guy in orange\". \u00a0Eventually the staff conceded that he exists, but he was \"misinformed\". \u00a0The $15 fee stood, however. \u00a0I gave the cash taker a $20-bill... no change. \u00a0So I asked for my change, and after she made some suspect eye-contact with the bouncer, she reluctantly gave me the $5 she owed me.  To summarize, free cover and free Patron turned into $10 cover with no free Patron, which turned into $15, which nearly became $20... an hour later. \u00a0Each step of the way we were a little more invested, so it wasn't worth it for us to turn away, which is why we stayed. \u00a0A primitive strategy that can make you a lot of money for an event, but ultimately a bad idea if you're at all interested in return business, good reviews, or have any ethics whatsoever.  Without getting into specifics (I don't want to be a dick), the dancers on the second floor leave *a lot* to be desired. \u00a0I was a bit embarrassed for them.

The club is spacious, the dim lighting in the first room makes it very chill, a cool place to relax with your friends and have a good time. The bar on the first room also is not as packed and service was quick and drinks were good. The second room has the huge dance floor with music videos playing and it was probably one of the nicer clubs I have been to during my stay in California and clubbing in general. The crowd with mixed with many different groups of people, which was nice to see. The DJs were pretty good, playing some music I could dance to though a few songs were obscure to me being an out-of-towner.   A really fun and chill and upscale place to go with your friends for a fun night in the city.",

The club walls consist mainly of windows, giving party-ers an amazing view of the city lit up in the night. Instead you are just a (slightly) 2-story club in the middle of North Beach with one window on the 2nd floor. It failed to give me an atmospheric feeling.  Got in, headed straight to the bar on the second floor, got drinks (they were pretty darn strong), walked to the dance floor, decided I needed more drinks, walked back to the dance floor, and boogied.   Yay for spacious dance floors, a chill first level floor with seating (for girls in painful heels to rest), a large bar, and decent music. Boo for stopping the music and kicking everyone out at 1:30am. Brings back (lame) memories of clubbing in Downtown SD during the college years. Also, I would not pay $20 for this place. It's nice, but not $20 nice.   I'm so ready for Vegas!",

I like the layout with some of the tables. It's akin to being just far enough from the crowd, instead of being blasted by flying drinks.   Though, with any club here: you can't dance when there isn't enough room to avoid touching someone's butt, and wading through the crowd to find a spot is futile. Even though the dance floor is pretty big, you're not likely to avoid a drink down your back.  I've never had a stellar experience here, but I've never had a bad one either.",

Finally when we were escorted in, the hostess had to ask a group that was already seated in our booth to leave. There was only 16 of us but I paid for 18 people instead. We had to wait 10mins for our bottles, and I ordered the Champagne and Belvedere special but she didn't bring out the champagne. We also ordered beers and she never brought them. She just brought our 2 bottles and mixers and never returned with my order of 3 buckets of beer or the champagne. I had to go to the bar to go get the beers. The whole night she never came back to check on us to ask if we wanted anything else or a refill on the mixers. I contacted Karen the lady that handled my reservation and she never responded. It's ridiculous that I over paid them and I never received any VIP service at all. We left the club and there was still drinks at our table. My friends and I were hoping to have a good time especially since they had Mase at the club that night performing. It was ridiculously pathetic!! I spent over $700 for bottle service and it wasn't worth it at all. What a total rip off!! \u00a0Since they knew the club was going to be crowded they should have been prepared for the crowd and be sure that the vip area received the service they paid for. I chose Atmosphere because the last time I went there with friends they were very good, but after last Saturday I am going to tell my other friends about how pathetic their service was. Karen could at least reply to my message or give me some kind of credit. I haven't heard from her or anyone else at Atmosphere.",

We got there around 10:30 and the line moved fast, unlike some clubs in SF that holds the line. It was still pretty empty around that time. The place is huge inside. the bar downstairs started to get packed around 11! They also have another room with tables where the smoking area is. The second floor didn't open till 11:30! I didn't realize how big that dance floor was till it opened!   Music was good downstairs AND upstairs! The bars were pretty big and the bartenders make the drinks really strong! Had an AMF from the bar downstairs and had another one upstairs. Tasted different, but both were strong!  Crowd's OKAY, it's free so it attracts all different types of people.... I agree with most of the reviews on here that this place is straight up ghetto! There were atleast three fights that night! Bouncers and security would push their way through and shove anybody to stop a fight! You can imagine how hard it would be to enjoy the good music playing when you gotta move out of the way for the bouncers or move away from a fight five feet away from you.  With that said, my friends and I enjoyed the club's music. I can't say the same for the club's \"ATMOSPHERE\", crowd, and the ghetto-ness! So one star for GOOD MUSIC and another for STRONG DRINKS! It definitely helps to be with good company and to sip on a strong drink to enjoy a place like this!",

When we arrived at 9:30pm, the door was locked with no indication that anything was going on. \u00a0Really annoyed, as I had 8 guests standing around, I tried calling to find out what's going on. \u00a0Nobody answered the phones. \u00a0All my calls went to voicemail. \u00a0This totally sucked. \u00a0  Then, as if by a miracle, somebody unchained the locks and put out the vile velvet ropes that would pointlessly torture their eager patrons for hours to come. \u00a0I asked about the situation and the door man merely indicated to form a line at the ropes while he shuffled across the street to stuff his gullet with a greasy slice of pizza. \u00a0Finally, 9:45pm swung around and the hosts finally get their act together and start checking IDs. \u00a0I indicated that I had put myself on the guest list and brought along 8 friends to help pad Atmosphere's wallets. \u00a0Ridiculously, the hostess tells me that not only were my friends not on the guest list, they would have to pay the bloody $20 cover even though it was before 11pm. \u00a0But, she said that we would still get our shot at the open bar, which she said would be extended to 10:45pm to make up for the full hour.  So, cold and clinging to optimism, we caved and paid up. \u00a0When we sidled up to the bar, we were informed by the hip bartender that only well drinks were available. \u00a0Errrr, we grunted and ordered up whatever simple shots of vodka, rum, and tequila we could think up. \u00a0In about 30 minutes, we had put down 3-4 rounds and was getting used to the overly loud music that nobody was dancing to. \u00a0Then again, with all the aspiring Lane Bryant customers filling up the joint, I could see no point in trying. \u00a0Sensing that I was obviously not drunk enough, I returned for another round and was told by the same hip bartender that the open bar was closed by 10:30pm, so lame. \u00a0  By 11pm, we could see that the scene wasn't improving and decided to cut bait on our cover charge. \u00a0I only hoped that I was sufficiently glazed over by alcohol to not betray my merciful gaze of pity on the shivering ladies still vying to get the night started.",

Don't get me wrong. I love suiting up and getting all GQ and what have you. I love stepping my white collar game up. But at a lounge/club, I'm just trying to \"dance with my girls\" LOL (fellas don't you love that line?) and I want to be rocking the most comfy shoes ever. But I digress.  Second off, I hate places that hold the line, but that's just par for the course. I hate when fellow Yelpers give lounges/clubs bad reviews based on things that cannot be controlled. Of course lines will be held, c'mon now.  Third off, once we finally got in (yeah we had to wait, but remember, par for the course) the music was way on point. Any time I walk in and \"When The Last Time\" by the Clipse is playing, you know it's going to be a good night. Smaller bar section downstairs, and a much larger dancefloor with a much larger bar upstairs.  Fourth off? You know you're at a \"club\" not bar when you got bathroom attendants at the joint. I was disappointed with dude's gum selection, to be quite honest with you. But he was Quickdraw McGraw with the paper towels as soon as I was done washing my hands, MY GAWD. Good shit man.  Fifth off, drinks are reasonably priced (for The City). Girls are way friendlier up here. And less snobby too. ATTN fellas: just don't get all grabby and pushy with the ladies, and you'll have a fun night, I promise you.  Overall, it's your basic club spot without all the bourgeois fanfare (everyone's entitled to their own opinion of course). The vibe was real cool. Good music, good peoples, good times.  Most likely I'll be back, but I wouldn't want to ruin the mystique of my first night at this spot. It's kind of like the Seinfeld theory. You got to go out while you're on top. And if I had a pretty amazing time here my first time here, why should I come back if that night can't be topped?  Or can it?  *DUN DUN DUN*",

I believe our party got into the club quickly because our party was mostly females. At the door we did the normal ID and pat down. During my pat down, the security advised to keep my pants up. WEIRD THING though, the bouncer pulled up my pants for me. The bouncer advised the guy before me the same, but he didn't ill up his pants. Just saying kind of weird.  When we got inside, the club was just filling up. The club is two stories. The first floor is mainly one bar and a bunch or vip tables. The second floor consists of a long bar, a few vip tables to side the bar and a stage. The bathrooms are located in the back of the second story.When I hit up the bar, and got normal shot and beer. Of course, I tipped well, which makes a big difference. For the rest of the night the female bartender was very attentive to tending to my service. Even when I was behind some people.  The dance floor gets pretty crowded. There is a good blend of people. The bouncers were being cool that night. My group had good time, so I can't complain about anything. I just wasn't impressed much, though.",

Atmosphere is a fun club in North Beach with a good mix of people. \u00a0I wish they had in and outs though which is the only thing I was annoyed about. \u00a0I liked the upstairs room better and there never seemed to be a line for the bar! \u00a0Good times at Atmosphere!",

AND there's a lounge area where you can just chill and sit.   1 star for people = there are tons of asians at this club. i'm asian so it was all good. besides that, it's a fun crowd.  1 star for fun factor = i've been here twice. once to try it out and another time for a VIP party. both times have been awesome. the place gets popin' around midnight.   -1 star because of location. it's in the heart of broadway. parking and traffic on a friday/saturday night is a nightmare. get here early or expect to pay more for parking than for cover.",

    "review_text": "Atmosphere is a small club, with a capacity of just 200. The space inside is very roughly divided into three spaces: a dance floor in the dark next to the DJ, a space next to the bar with a few seats to aid chilling out, and a space by the stairs where the toilets and a second dance floor which seems dead. My friends and I had to queue for 10 minutes to get in and each paid a $15 entry fee, but it was totally worth it. Even at full capacity, there's space to chill out and take a breather, something that PP deserve a lot of credit for ensuring, rather than attempt to squeeze every last possible punter in.  One of the best aspects of the experience though was the crowd and the general atmosphere there: people were simply there to enjoy and bop to the music in a completely uninhibited yet space-respecting fashion. This desire was underlined by the very few camera flashes throughout the night - people were there to have fun, not to show the Facebook world just how hip they were.   The bar was pretty reasonable too, with a good range of spirits, beer, cocktails and even some wine at decent prices: bottled beer was $5 \u00a0and $10 for AMFs. Service was friendly and very quick.  And the music? Simply superb, with DJ serving up an expertly crafted mix of acid jazz, electro, hip hop, reggae and a range of other genres too, all through the club's incredible sound system.   I recommend this place if you do not like to be on the crowdy side and to be with your friends.",

The DJ was also sloppy--whenever he changed songs he would mix in the second song, everyone would get excited and start boppin to the new beat, and then he would either slow waaaaaaaay down or pause, leaving the dance floor hanging for a good 20 seconds, kind of wanting to dance but not really being able to groove to the weird mash-up. \u00a0And he did that EVERY SINGLE TIME.

After you get past the fact that it's surrounded by strip clubs and other rather trashy hangouts, and past the homeland security-like check at the front door, this place is fantastic!  I love the space - like a loft in the meatpacking district of NYC. There was always a spot for my friend and I to sit (so necessary when you're wearing 4 inch heels!), and plenty of room for us to get our groove on. The dance floor is huge! I didn't have to step on anyone's feet to get them off of my back. Not everyone looked like a model, but overall the people there tried to look good and avoided the kinds 6 inch platform heels and spandex.   The night we were there (last saturday), they had free lotus vodka until 11pm. And somehow, after arriving at 10:52, we managed to fit in 2 vodka crans. Classy, I know. The bartender, Nicole, was incredibly nice, attentive, fast, and had us take a free shot with her! She was so much fun that we didn't want to leave the bar. But we eventually did. Why you ask? THE FISH TANK. Nothing says baller more than a purple-blue fish tank. I think every club needs to make it a staple decoration.   Finally, at the end of the night we were waiting outside for our friend (Arnaud, the DJ of the night), and they ushered us back inside to let us wait in the warmth even though they were closed. It gave me a chance to chat with Greg, the bouner, who was surprisingly nice and fun!  Overall, I can't wait to go back, and I wish I had enough friends to rent the place out for a killer party.

So, yenno, keep that in mind, and whatnot.  My friends and I decided to finally get off our lazy adult asses and do something for NYE because I was finally going to be in California (instead of crappy Michigan) and we wanted to enjoy ourselves. We didn't want to do a stuffy hotel party, we didn't wanna deal with a house party, so we decided to go to a club. Atmosphere seemed to be a good balance, because it was near a few restaurants we were considering for dinner that night. Also, we bought our tickets in mid-November, so they were $56/ea for open bar. Yeah. That was pretty awesome.  The bouncers were nice guys and were quick at getting folks in, and the bartenders seemed pretty good. The DJs played a good mix of music downstairs. Upstairs, though, the music was INFINITELY better. And I'm not just saying that cuz one of our good friends from high school, DJ William Wes (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FdjWilliamWes.blogspot.com%2F&amp;s=1eed3616c732db2a662bb81beee5ae3867ee2cbd6fd1163981eed8cab7f5181f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">djWilliamWes.blogspot.com</a>), was DJ'ing upstairs. We had a lot of fun dancing and drinking and overall having a good time. They also had a smoking area outside which served a friend of mine rather well; it was also nice because the smoking area was attached to a small room with chairs that got a very, very nice breeze, which provided a nice cool break from the hotness of the club.  I can see where the \"ghetto\" bit might come into play though.... I think there was less of that on NYE though because most people who spend the money to come out on NYE aren't gonna be the same types of folks who cause a ton of shit at a nightclub on a regular basis. We did, however, get to watch some dude get taken out by a bouncer, whilst in a chokehold. Did I mention the bouncer was like, 6 inches shorter than the dude he was dragging out? It was AMAZING.

There is $10 valet type garage a few blocks away (closer to waterfront), much easier to park here then trying to get into the section right next to Atmosphere.   The line was insane and barely moving and definitely no way to make it in by 11 on the guest list. There was a group ahead of us that started out with 7 people and turned into 40 something. The line barley moved for over 45 minutes since this group became insanely large. Luckily a very friendly bouncer approached me and my friends and showed us to the front of line, very much appreciated! This saved us from our misery.  We immediately went upstairs to the second dance floor and to the bar. The bartender chick was inconsiderate. Several guys approached the bar after me was able to get drinks faster than I. I asked my boyfriend to stand at the bar next to me to get her attention and it must have worked. The bartender asked what drinks he wanted just as I was complaining to friends that the bartender is only serving guys. She must have heard since she told the boyfriend he would get my drinks first, then his.  This is one crazy crowded place. I saw a girl passed out on the floor in the stall and chicks dancing on a platform fighting. Overall the music was good and we had a fun time..

Although Atmosphere is one of the better nightclubs on the Broadway strip, it still falls short of a decent SF nightclub.   I've been to Atmosphere about a total of two times. Each time was for a friend's birthday. The good thing about this place is that there is tons of space. If you're looking to host a big event such as a birthday...then this place would be an option for you to consider.  Other than that, nothing really special. Drinks were pretty expensive, $28 for a total of three drinks. Bathroom was dirty, music was okay, super crowded and the crowd was ghetto. I don't know what it is about Broadway that attracts ghetto people. \u00a0Every nightclub and block on that street seems to be full of them.  Oh, and good luck with parking. There is a parking lot right next to Atmosphere. Convenient for your feet but not your wallet. $20 to park for a couple of hours. Not really worth it if you ask me....",

But other than that everything else about this club sucks. I've been here three times. Once for my friends birthday and once for my birthday. 2 of the three times i went there I slipped and fell on my face because of the wet floor that they don't clean! Not because I was too drunk. I never have fallen at a club or bar other than here. This last time I went, was for the free artist show and I went to go see one of the artist. He promoted the event and got a bunch of people to come and watch him perform. Probably 20 people came just to see him. They promised him a 20 minute set and we were waiting all night just to see him perform. Came down to 1am and they ended up saying they couldn't have him perform because the club didn't want to give that much time to a new artist that no one knows... Which made no sense because we brought most of the people there and when we found out half the club left- After i spent $40 on shitty drinks. Basically their shady business. Don't mess with ICU Networking ENT. They don't keep their word and their totally sketchy. Never going to that club again.",

If you are in a hip hop/top 40 mood and just want to dance, Atmosphere is a great spot for that. \u00a0It's a natural layout for a dance floor and offer plenty of space. \u00a0The music was also on point. \u00a0Not too much of that EDM stuff that you can't really dance too. \u00a0  Bartenders and staff were friendly and are pretty fast, considering the amount of people at the bar. \u00a0Crowd was okay, a good mix of people.

I actually really like this club. Perhaps if I didn't have a good experience, I'd rate this place lower, but I had a great experience, so that certainly helps. It was apparently ladies' night when we came here (and it certainly was a ladies night for us this particular night!) so the ladies got free champagne. The champagne wasn't bad, either, though my fellow lady friends didn't like it and gave theirs to me (more for me!)--I reckon they are the vodka and Patron types. I like that there is a lounge area, and then a large dance floor area, which you enter by going up some stairs (a bit difficult in stilettos... and maybe with a drink or two in your system).  The dance floor area is super spacious, and that is a definite plus in my book. The music was, of course, of your typical top 40s hits, so it was alright. The bar experience was also good--we didn't have to wait too long to get the bartender's attention. However, because we were a group of girls, guys kept trying to get in on the action! That was slightly annoying, because I hate creepers, but we simply just danced away, and we still had a great night!",

Small room/bar in the front room, with a side VIP lounge and then upstairs a much larger room, with more VIP tables.

I mostly go to clubs with the main purpose of getting low and really dancing, the dee jays were pretty bad. \u00a0Both rooms kept switching from more fun popular hip hop, to old school slower hip hop and then threw in house music. \u00a0It just didn't quite flow together to keep you moving. \u00a0Got great drinks and then moved on to another club that night. \u00a0I'd probably go back to check it out again in a few more months, perhaps after the dee jay figures it all out. \u00a0Oh...for all the ladies out there, the bathrooms were SUPER clean.",

    "review_text": "Get DRUNK, I mean \"Drink\" for a Cause? I'm so there...  Let me preface by saying that I do NOT like partying on Broadway; too many Po-Po's, the crowd tends to be rowdy and ghetto and parking SUCKS.   I've come to Atmosphere/A3 about 5 times for clubbing events but last Friday was the very first time I actually had fun at A3 BEFORE the club even opened!  On February 4th, my friends and I came for a \"Drink for a Cause\" Happy Hour Event hosted my mPowering from 6 PM-10 PM. Since this was a charitable event, the crowd were Young Professionals in their late 20's to mid 30's, mainly Asian. This is of course is not representative of the typical club night there which was very refreshing.   There was a DJ spinning Top 40s, Hip-Hop and Mashups. Not sure if it was the alkie, but my friend and I couldn't help but comment about how good the music was. Needless to say, after 1...2...3...4 drinks/shots later, one friend ended up on the stage, one doing \"The Sprinkler\" and the other doing \"The Lawnmower\". As for me, well let's just say, I was ready to throw my own Trampoline Party until my inner voice of reason told me this is a \"charity\" event and NOT your typical Saturday night of debauchery. :T  Again this \"Drink for a Cause\" HH Event is not representative of the typical club night at A3, so here's the nitty gritty. First and foremost, the crowd and music varies depending on who's promoting, so make sure to check the calendar on A3's website.   C O V E R:  FREE before 11 PM if you're on the Promoter's GL, otherwise it's $20 at the door.  L I N E: Dependent on the Promoters and how large of a crowd they can draw in, but I've never had to wait in line more than 10 minutes.  D R E S S \u00a0C O D E: Club attire; no sports wear.  C R O W D: Varies; but I've only come to A3 for Asian hosted parties which currently occurs the 1st Saturday of every month. I haven't been to one of the Asian parties here in over 8 months, but the crowd tends to be the same for this promotion company; early 20s to mid 20s and on the fobby side.   M U S I C: During the Asian hosted parties, they only play Top 40s, Hip Hop, and Mashups.  B A R S: There's 2 bars; one in the front room and one in the main back room with 3-4 (non-friendly) bartenders working at each bar.   D R I N K S: $9 for top shelf cocktail and shots. No CC minimum.  Drinks are inconsistent. On Friday, I had 4 Goose Club Sodas and 2 of them tasted like plain Club Sodas.  T A B L E \u00a0S E R V I C E: *Bottles start at $150 and need to be book in advanced through the Promoter or the the club *Front Room - There are about 4 tables for bottle service which is in a more semi-private room *Back Main Room - There's 3 booths for bottle service that overlooks the dancefloor  A M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R: Modern industrial warehouse...  The semi-private front room has exposed red brick walls and a beautiful illuminated fish tank. The front bar area has a pool table and a small dancing area.   The main backroom is more like a big open warehouse space so you can mingle and dance. There's also a stage in the backroom where you're free to dance on BUT just be careful going up/down the stairs. The ventilation is very poor in the back room when it's crowded.   WARNING: The floors are very slippery when wet so ladies be careful when you're strutting around in your 5 inch stilettos.   R E S T R O O M S: The front room has one stall for men and one stall for women. The back room has 5-6 stalls for women. There's normally a bathroom attendant so the bathrooms are normally well-kept except sometimes they're out of toilet seat covers.   P A R K I N G: HORRENDOUS! The nearest lot is 2-3 buildings away near Sutra. Weekdays is $15 and Weekends is $20. The lot normally fills up by 10:30-10:45 PM, so try to get there early.   If it weren't for the fact that my friends and I had a blast during HH, A3 would be getting 2 stars. Apparently, we had so much fun that we met several people at Bubble Lounge later that night that said, \"Hey, I saw you guys at A3 for that HH...\" while we had NO recollection. Yes, welcome to our HHs!",

The place is okay, there are two bars, one in the front when you first walk in and then one in the back where the dance floor is and I'm guessing the main room of the venue.  There is staff in the bathroom which I didn't expect at a venue like this one..  Drinks were decently priced and not too skimpy like other places on Broadway.",

What's worse is, I showed up tonight trying to meet some friends, and the pre-door guy told me I couldn't come in with the shoes I was wearing. Online it says club attire- no sportswear. I was wearing $300 Diesel boots. I'll admit, I was wearing them out (pant bottoms inside the boots), but I promptly pulled my pants over the boot tops making them look like leather dress nice shoes, and the guy still said \"NOPE\". Like... you can't fool me with those nice shoes- I KNOW you're wearing boots under those pants.  I also had previously asked the actual door guy if they were passable to get in and he said \"yes, they're fine\".  After visiting another bar and coming back to get my friends, 2 fights broke out and people were taken away in handcuffs.  I suggest avoiding this place at all costs, if not for the club itself, but for the people that go there. You might swiftly be dragged into their world.",

Both are great - pink and fruity for the girls, coke based and strong for the dudes. Ask for a Jay Special, just make sure to TIP HIM WELL! He rocks!

I was open to fun anywhere though. Certainly, I've had a good time at Dragon Bar before.   But, damn, Atmosphere does not know how to keep a supportive clientele. Went to their \"Grand Opening Party\" on Saturday 10.18 \u00a0- same night and same sad story as Quinn &amp; Chefboyardee. I was really looking forward to checking out the new place from the 3 reviews I read here before going and knowing a bunch of my friends were also going to be there and the supposed free Patron!   Waiting in the cold for an hour (my mistake but that was because friends \u00a0were inside - apparently decided to skip the long guest list line and just pay the $20 cover) for a club so empty it couldn't warm me up was not how I had envisioned my fun night out. Mostly, what aggravates me was the lying and/or total lack of communication about why they were taking so long (apparently it takes more than 10 min to check for a person's name on the guest list) and what their cover charge was going to be (free - $10 - $15 - $20- your first born). I was also creeped out by the swiping of my driver's licence and taking of my picture before being allowed in - rather big brothery... \u00a0Could've been the mood all this put me in before getting in there but me (who normally likes dancing anywhere to whatever music - even Target to the embarassment of some companions) couldn't feel enough in me to do more than bob my head and pity the poorly-outfitted gogo dancers. I hate to be a negative nelly so, at least the drinks were well-poured and there was actually no line for the women's room!  After the debacle of Atmosphere, I have joined in my friend's distaste for North Beach's stripe shirted-hair gel-wish they were smart enough to be frat boys and the panty-showcasing hemlines (I kept wanting to ask if these girls knew their underwear was showing and to help them pull down the dresses). I may give North Beach another shot some day (when I miss seeing the Sheriff's bus battling it out with the party buses) but I can't go back to Atmosphere.

This place is a full out CON.   Here's why it SUCKS ass:  1. I received an email from the club saying that on Thursday May 7th there was going to be a \"Very special performance by Grammy Award winner Chrisette Michell, also appearing Jamie Foxx and Day 26 (Making the Band).\"  CON - I called ahead, I emailed, just to make sure... They confirmed Chrisette Michell was performing. Did she perform? NOPE! It wasn't till about 12:30 AM that she got on stage after the announcer said \"here's what we've all been waiting for!\" and she said\"thanks for supporting me and my album\" and said a couple other words for about a minute and that was ALL. She got off the stage and a bunch of local rappers got up and started goofing off. \u00a0No Jamie Foxx - total lie to get people to come. \u00a0No Day 26 but who cares about them! haha  2. \"Free guest list before 11 pm\"  CON - We were on the guest list and got stamped outside as being confirmed. At about 10:30 we got in the FIRST set of doors. \u00a0Then as we were about to go inside, a new lady said \"What's your name? Oh you're not on the guest list\" and I said \"Well how did I get this stamp on my wrist then? I saw my name on the list\" and she goes \"Ok, well you're not on the list. 10 dollars each.\" \u00a0So apparently they decide who they wanna charge and how many \"different\" lists they're going to have. \u00a0What's the point of getting on the list if they are going to screw you over?  3. The pictures on the website portraying a new, cool club, with nice lighting and sexy \"atmosphere.\"  LIE! - This place is SUPER lame inside. There are two levels and the first level is not impressive at all. \u00a0Their fish tank was about the only thing I liked. There's paint chipping. The floors dirty. The lighting sucks - WAY TOO BRIGHT and awkward. And above the fish tank they just put some weird slab of wood to make it blend in with the wall. SUPER tacky! \u00a0Upstairs was a larger room for dancing... It was OK. Bathrooms had attendants in them trying to help you dry your hands which is unnecessary cause the place isn't even nice.   4. The drinks were OK. \u00a0They were pricey. My boyrfriend liked his rum and coke. \u00a0But my drink was WEAK.  5. The people there were all too trashed to realize how stupid this place really is.  6. Creepy old guys standing off to the side eye-f*cking girls...   7. Had maybe 2 or 3 good songs that played between two hours  8. Place was never PACKED and when we left at 12:45 AM and there was still a HUGE line to get in.   9. Bad location. \u00a0Trashy area. \u00a0Not at all in the cool parts of North Beach.  10. They treat their club like we're in Hollywood. \u00a0Frisking people. \u00a0Taking EVERYONES photo as you get your ID scanned. \u00a05 or more bouncers with ear pieces. Come on. It's not that serious.  So overall, they have a big ol scam going on here. \u00a0They're making major moola off drunk people's stupidity to come here. And unfortunately non-drunk folks who bought into the few \"good reviews\" and the pictures - that'd be me! ARRRRRRG! \u00a0  Save yourself the money, time and annoyance - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

Karen and Marissa were excellent hostesses. They were prompt with all of our requests and were extremely nice and accommodating. The crowd was very diverse, which is a huge plus in my book.

    "review_text": "You ever meet someone who seems like they would be a great person from pictures but once you get to see who they are on the inside they are just worst person? That is how I felt about Atmosphere.   The legitimate conversation that happened before trying this place. I heard they get major hip hop performers to perform there and its actually hip hop in SF!  Is it worth dealing with the people? Well its located near some other bars so maybe we could save the night! Is it worth dealing with the people there? Well we are already walking there so its too late now.  Still is it worth dealing the people there? It wasn't.   The crowd at Atmosphere just kind of makes you feel uncomfortable. For the setup that they have at the club it really should be much better. The harsh reality and the truth of why most clubs don't play exclusively hip hop is because they don't want the crowd that comes to that place. It can be diverse and some really enjoy hip hop but it attracts so many people who either want to start shit or steal things that it is not worth wading your way through that mess. And this is not a race thing. The sketchy people were of all colors and sizes.   As many said below the staff feels like they are a big deal for what they are trying to do. I appreciate the dress code etc in any place but the way they toss people out of line and inspect you it makes you even more upset when you realize the club is nothing worth getting into. I can put up with this crap to get into the Grand because at least i know there is an experience inside. Here its like getting felt up to get to a delayed flight at the airport. You just don't get why they were so rough and you feel sad because you had to go through it for nothing.   Once inside the ticket lady immediately tries to take you money and she can't even believe people found out about the guest list let alone use it and is very reluctant to let you in for free. We came on a performance night which increased the number of people but it was still disappointingly few people. There is no way this place fills up on a \u00a0Friday or Saturday on it own which is another reason not to risk your night unless you are going to the many nearby strip clubs which I imagine many are.   There are some photo areas near the entrance and the bar is small but good enough to serve the small crowd. No issues with this area. I gave the place two stars because I appreciate any place that actually has room to dance. Their back room is actually really nice and has a large dance floor. The problem is there is no one there you will want to dance with or feel safe dancing with without a safe word.. Seriously ladies if you go here you will get outright grabbed and scoped for hours. It was unnerving to watch the gays swoop in here.   The performance was cool as hell though and you are right up close to the performer with the stage built into the back of the dance floor. The DJ was also amazing. Some of the best hip hop set list i have heard in the city.   But it was not worth everything happening around you. It all felt like it was an attempt at a party that never really started. If you are into hip hop and don't care about how bad the crowd is around you then you can take the dive and go for this place but no matter the positives it is not worth feeling like you could have had a better time anywhere else in the city.",

Maybe that's simply because by the time I got here I had a couple of drinks under my belt.  Pretty big dancefloor! The lights were basically on and there was no \"club lighting\" which would have been cool. The floor was kinda dirty too. I think they need to turn the lights down and add some lighting and it will feel more like a club here!  Ok.. it's the best club I've been to on Broadway yet.. but that doesn't say much for Broadway if you know what I mean.   Only come here if you're stuck on Broadway. By no means should you come here intentionally.",

QUICK TIP: there is a spot on the dance floor that never gets hot! it's near the fan and in front of the air vent. if we are there on the same night i'll probably fight you for it, but i highly recommend it because you can stay cool as you dance the night away.  the drama however continues... but that won't stop me from coming back. it's part of the fun i suppose.   until next time,  cheers!",

It looks very small when you first walk in, but there is a separate dance floor that is pretty big (for SF). When we first arrived, there was open bar which was pretty awesome (we scored 2 drinks before it ended). I guess if you go in with low expectations, you'll probably have a good time. My only suggestion is to go early so you avoid paying cover. They move the line slowly, so get there by 10:15pm. Good times!",

Got there before 11pm to get in free on the guestlist. \u00a0The people at the door were friendly. The first room was a chill spot with a smaller bar. \u00a0Free champagne and cupcakes! \u00a0There were only 2 bartenders working at the time and it got a little bit of a wait. \u00a0Disappointed that they were limited on what they had and couldn't make me a mojito. Boo! My sister's Tokyo Ice Tea tasted like sewer water! Im not exaggerating. \u00a0The bar counters smelled like old wet rags. \u00a0  Finally they opened up the bigger dance room at around 12pm. It was a nice big area to dance and their dj booth and bar was beautiful! The music wasn't much to my liking at first, but then it picked up and they played more hip hop r&amp;b mash ups. \u00a0The crowd was decent. \u00a0Seemed like its a spot for big groups to meet up and have a fun time. So if you're looking to have a fun event with 15+ of your best homies, this is a good spot for that.   Crowd that nite was a mix of asians filipinos latins  Overall, I probably wouldn't go to this club again. \u00a0I had to drink more than I planned just to enjoy my time. \u00a0I'm sure people have a great time at this place but it just wasn't to my liking.

    "review_text": "I've been to Atmosphere 4 times, mainly for birthdays. I think this club is a popular choice for many because it is spacious and the music is top 40 hip-hop. \u00a0People say this club is ghetto, yes, but I've had good times here!  There are 2 floors. The first floor is chill, due to the smaller dancing area and dim lighting. The second floor is the main floor. The dance floor is pretty big. There's a stage where girls can slut it out. There are two VIP sections upstairs, one next to the stage and one in the back near the bathrooms. If you are getting VIP, I'd recommend requesting the one next to the dance stage so that it's closer to the dance floor and you can see more action. My friend got a table near the bathrooms, and it's pretty far from the dance floor. I felt disconnected from the fun and our group. Also, I believe VIP gets only 5 wristbands per table, so if you are trying to sneak the rest of your group to the table, you should share wristbands because they are strict with entrance.  I came here 3 times with my name on guestlist. Once, I waited in line around 10:20, thinking I would get in before 11 for free. Wrong!! They held up the line to after 11, and I had to pay $20. \u00a0Disappointing! \u00a0Another time, I came here with a partybus at 11:30 and it was empty. The busy-ness varies and I'd say it is busier on Sat nights than Fri nights. Also, they occasionally have open bar 10-11, but you have to sign up for those.  The crowd here is pretty ghetto! But that doesn't mean you won't have fun! One time, a rap group called Tha Outfit performed on stage and made it rain $1 bills!! I got caught $9 from that night!!! \u00a0Oh, and a black guy asked my friend to be in his porn production. Told ya, it's ghettto!!!  One last thing: I contacted them to request free entrance for our partybus to be extended from 11 to 11:30. I didn't expect a response, but the guy emailed me back the same day and accommodated my request. I liked that they actually communicate back, unlike anywhere else....  I would only come here if it's free!",

    "review_text": "Giving this place a one star because I have to. I went in there with a group of 16 people with a limo company. To get in we had to waste a good 20 minutes because they wanted to talk to the owner/driver personally before we got in the club. They handed out tickets to 15 people and we were missing one ticket. They argued that we had to pay 20 for the admission although we had wristbands and stamps from the limo.  These guys just want to make money period. They try every hook and crook. After spending about $500 in the bar we decided for a smoke about 14 of us went out as advised by one of the bouncers and when we tried reentering they wanted us to pay $20 a head again. I was like this is not happening. After speaking to 6 bouncers I spoke to this very arrogant manager/supervisor claiming we all have coats inside and we are not leaving without them. After spending a few minutes waiting for his response we talked to the cops that were outside, told them what the situation was they forced them to accept us back in the club again. This place has a stage where apparently they only allow \u00a0ladies wearing close to nothing on it. After being pulled up by 3 girls a friend of mine was thrown off stage by bouncers. We told them if they do not allow guys on stage they should post a note. We also said if there were any injuries coming from that push, we would file charges.  There are a lot of clubs in this district I would not recommend this piece of shit place to anyone because of their overpriced drinks, a full line up of staff that works in every way possible to get in your wallet. The people that come in here are great and friendly for the most part. Their restrooms are in the corner and you have bouncers right outside trying to throw people off the club for apparently being a little drunk but if you walk with the bouncer to the bar and order drinks you are good to stay. They close at 1:45 A.M. and have a lineup of rude staff up your butt to get you out. One of my friends accidentally left a coat there at the check-in and we called the club after we got out and back home only to hear that the coat was not there. How do you give out somebody's belongings when we still have the check-in stub.  I would rather not go out partying then go to this place ever again.",

Bottle service has two areas, one down stairs and one upstairs.  The one down stairs was dark and....dark.  The upstairs bottle service area was much larger, but required you to show your wrist band before entering....It also smelled like hard boiled eggs in that area.   **TIP: get the shots upstairs -- the ones down stairs were skimpy.   When we first got in, there werent a lot of people there (mind you this was around 11pm) ... i understand they have to mediate how many people come in at a time, but it seemed like more yelling went on outside versus getting people in.   Smoking section was small so we had to wait a while to get out there.  Overall, it was cool -- your average club. Top 40s music. Not so cool when you're just sandwiched in between other sweaty drunk people -- it got pretty packed. The venue was nothing spectacular or memorable, but it was decent.   **TIP: finding a cab after the club here is ridonkulous!!!

Upon entering this joint, there's this smoky and dark setting that just hits you, creepers standing on the sidelines observing who is going in. There is a bar w/in a few feet from the entrance so it was definitely a challenge to walk through and get to the stairs. Yes, this place has 2 stories, each playing different beats. The bathrooms are located upstairs as well and it appears that the door is to be remained open while a quiet and old Asian woman cleans up after each use of the sink and hand delivers you a paper towel... there is a tip jar for her \"services\" and I find that quite odd.   The music upstairs was horrible. The music downstairs were dance-able and they were playing some hit 90's- 112! I don't know what it is but I did not get a good groove on when upstairs but that's where my group was to be posted. We were among the firsts to dance, my group. Then it started to get crowded, very crowded. The spillage of drinks written in some of the reviews were no joke- some dumbass girl spilled some of her drink on me and some douche spilled his drink over me because he tried to get me to dance all up on him- I don't think so, aashole. This is a club and I came to dance, if I wanted to get frisky, I would have opted for actual sex. Seriously- nobody genuinely dances anymore? Is it grinding and humping part of it now? Does it make one feel or look cool doing it? Because I did not have 1 decent dance the whole entire night. Was it the crowd at this particular club? Not sure but it scarred me from going dancing unless I am w/ my significant other.   There is a platform/stage area on the second floor and I guess one needs to wear extremely short ass skirts or dresses or shorts to be up there.. apparently no style of dancing is ok too.. as long as you show skin, it's all that matters. The VIP area was blocked off w/ a thing and there is a security lady that checks you in so that was a good thing.   The bar area can get crowded but I actually stood there, wishing my night was over w/ already. At least the bartender was nice. I wanted water, I thought I was going to get charged for a bottled water but no, I was given a glass of ice water w/ a straw, no charge!   There is a seating area on the first floor and I spent the last 40 minutes rereading my texts and resting my poor feet that has been on 3in. heels the entire night. There is a covered pool table right in the area too and some used that as a dancing dirty platform.   No ins and outs here. I wanted to leave the club to get something to eat and come back but apparently I couldn't do that. I had to endure 2hrs and some minutes here.   My God. Never. Again. Never.",

After informing the bartender I got major attitude, she remixed the drink and put salt on the rim instead of sugar!  Finally, people were at the private event that were not on the list. If I wanted a random guy to proceed to hump me without an invitation and then follow me around, not taking the hint, I would not have gone to a private party where there was supposed to be door control.   I repeat, do not rent out Atmosphere for an event. Hopefully our party got their C game staff and they have a better staff for their \"real patrons\" because that was clearly their attitude about our private event.",

It wasnt packed but it was sure not empty either. Tough to explain, maybe because i was already buzzin, as usual. I would recommend it. 20 dollar price tag is a bit steep but im sure you will have fun. didnt see any fights that night. This place, obviously, does not compare or come close to Vegas. If you visit San Fran, check it out, youll have a good, weird fun time.",

    "review_text": "I came here for a friend's bday last Saturday. Luckily we were on a guest list so no crazy waiting in the line that turns into the alleyway next to the building. I saw this man rummaging \u00a0through the trash bin like 30 feet away from us...creeeeeeeepy. Or maybe he was just taking out the trash.   There were three \"areas\" to the club. One techno/trance-ish room with a fish tank (my favorite part of the room but they need more fish. However all the beats and pounding vibrations might stress them out). \u00a0The two other areas were a mix of R&amp;B and hip hop. The floors were hella slippery though, it hard to get your groove on if you had even babyheels on. The music was alright, I was fascinated by this muppets music video they had projected onto the walls. It was so cute.   Pros: - strong drinks - fun music - $3 coat check - friendly crowd  Cons: - slippery floor - small bathrooms (3 stalls max I think) - small-ish venue (it was comparable to a club in HK) - slight concern for animal cruelty to the fish  I loved my ladies' night though. Everyone else got messed up quick. There are convenience stores located CONVENIENTLY nearby for a water or something to sober drunk pals up :) Lots of cops around though. Behave or be careful!",

    "review_text": "I came here for a friend's birthday celebration and I actually had a really good time. I want to warn you though, our party reserved a table for bottle service, so my review may be slightly bias due to the special treatment that we got.  Anyhow...my first impression upon stepping into the club, was that it was really small. I did not realize that there was a second floor, until our waitress escorted us to a closed off section upstairs. What I really liked was the size of our booth. Usually clubs have tiny booths that can only fit like five people. Our booth at Atmosphere fit about twice the number of people comfortably. We were right next to the go-go dancers too, so we had a good view.   The dance floor was really spacious and I was able to dance without bumping into anyone. The restroom was closely located and there were enough stalls to prevent long lines. Overall, the club was pretty clean and nicely decorated. I wouldn't mind partying here again.",

    "review_text": "I've been to almost EVERY club in SF...so I have an idea of what to expect and what to look out for once I go to a new venue.  (1) Line: It was a 1000+ invite private party which I was invited to, I was definitely skeptical about getting in. Luckily, the bday boy was able to pull people as he felt appropriate and the general line moved rather quickly. Was out of the cold in 5 minutes. Doormen were very courteous.   (2) Bar: Great service, super speedy. What do you expect when you go to a party with tons of people, instant drinks? People were nice about shifting positions and once I got to the bar...I was able to order 10 drinks without hesitation.   (3) Music: The best I've heard in a long time. Usually when you go to clubs and they advertise hip-hop/top-40...some awkward mix of random rock/trance funks up the mood. There were distinct, separate moments for mash-ups and awesome r &amp; b throwbacks, keeping the crowd happy overall.   (4) VIP support: If you get a table, you're treated like a king. No wait, instant service, hassle-free pricing. A+  (5) Crowd: Depends on the promoter. Again, I went on a night of a private party so it was entirely up to the bday boy to supply the list.   Overall, this is one of the cleanest, classiest North Beach lounges so far. It definitely surpassed the old Zebra and Infinity lounge setup and I can imagine myself visiting again without hesitation. Consider it the SF club experience without the rude attitude.",

As we waiting impatiently to get in I see all these people (must be \"friends\" of the owner but shouldn't they worry more about the people dropping the most MONEY?) get in with no wait and no line. I asked the bouncer what was the hold up a few times and he acted as if the VIP tables were so busy, but when we finally got in we were only one of the TWO tables occupied.   The bathroom was more disgusting than a regular club restroom, but the crowd was decent. However, \u00a0I would have been happier if I celebrated my grad night at a place that actually appreciates money from table service.",

    "review_text": "Perhaps this is unheard of, but for once I am about to rate a club 4 stars and we're not even in Vegas.  I had plenty of doubts about this place since I've never heard of it and it's got average reviews. My friend claimed they were having a hosted bar and put us all on the guest list.  We actually arrived at the club early (oh my) and I was, quite literally, the first person in line. The ID and guestlist checking began, but for some reason the first three people in our party were not on the list although the rest were. However, the bouncer was nice and let us in anyway. Once inside, they had catered food! Yes we are talking shrimp cocktails, sliders, cupcakes, munchies, calamari, bruschetta, the works!  I personally have not seen this at a club before, so I skidaddled over for some cupcakes and beef skewers and took off to the bar. Gin, rum and vodka (and mixed drinks with those) were free between 10-11 so we got our drinks on. Some people a little more so than others ...  The downstairs area had a nice lounge section with a fish tank (and probably some highly stressed out fish ...) Upstairs dance floor wasn't bad either. Go go dancers and good music. Pretty good!",
