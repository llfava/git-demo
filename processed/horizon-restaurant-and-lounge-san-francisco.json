Only 3 employees on the floor, one of which is the bartender, on a Saturday night? Odd. We'll see how that goes...   20 min waiting for a server. Took our order. Then 20 min waiting with no water, no bread, starving... Finally, our LAMB BURGERS came and they were juicy &amp; \u00a0extremely flavorful! YUM. The TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were kick ass!! Good way to start our dinner. BUT...   Dun dun dun!!! Our appetizers didn't come before our entrees. Another 20 min of waiting after eating the burgers. Finally, we got our TUNA TINI which was warm (Note: it's raw tuna &amp; hence should be cold right?) NO flavor, tasted like warm 'something'... ANOTHER 20 min of waiting for our calamari! We were almost going to cancel it, but received it cold, so we sent it back. \u00a0Did I mention our water only got refilled once by the bartender? We had to go up there &amp; ask her.   Food would had been great if it was served properly &amp; on time. I would definitely come out for the food again, but hope they will do something about their service.",

    "review_text": "Hmmm...no. Horizon is in a great location to sexy fun times in North Beach, strip clubs, bars etc, but the fun times end there. I'm not sure if it was an off night or what, but I saw three servers in the whole restaurant, which wouldn't have been a problem if I hadn't been anxiously searching them out for the entire time I was there. It took at least 10 minutes for me to get my first drink, and I was sitting at a table next to the bar.   We ordered the Cesar salad, calamari, lamb burger and Kobe burger. First the salad came out, standard Cesar, but the as advertised anchovies were missing in action... bummer. Then my entree came out. As I waited for others to get their food, my burger got colder and colder. My calamari was still MIA and so was my date's entree. Fast forward, the entire table of 12 people were eating dinner, and my date was nibbling at my chilled friend as burger. Finally the calamari makes a cameo, and I inquire about the burger's whereabouts. The waitress, who did seem overwhelmed, did not place the order. Apologies and free cheesecake eventually ensue, but eating your entree at a table full of people done eating is no fun. Overall, there were interesting drink choices, so if I'm back, I'll probably skip the food and just go to the bar for drinks.",

    "review_text": "I hate to write this review, given that a group of us headed to Horizon Restaurant and Lounge for late night grub based on the fact that the roommate of one of our party works here.  I hate to write this review because in general the staff was very nice and efficient and tolerated our stupid drunk asses.  I hate to write this review because the food tasted pretty good and the cocktails were strong.  I hate to write this review because I'm not good at being mean and nasty... \u00a0But, I feel like I have to write this review based on what happened to me AFTER I ate at Horizon Restaurant and Lounge...  So my date and I ordered steak tartar - I should have known better - as this dish is not something you want to eat off of just any menu. \u00a0It requires the highest quality of beef and careful preparation so that the diner doesn't get ill from eating it. \u00a0This is why most restaurants don't serve steak tartar or carpachio or other raw beef dishes... \u00a0the risk outweighs the number of people who actually will be impressed that it is on the menu.  I hate to write this review, but I'm afraid I have to: the steak tartar at Horizon Restaurant and Lounge gave me food poisoning. \u00a0I know what food poisoning feels like and that is exactly what kept me up pretty much all night with my head in the toilet.  I feel like someone punched me repeatedly in my stomach. \u00a0It was bad.  I feel very bad for writing this review... but, I think that people need to know that this happened so that they can order accordingly.  The other food was great. \u00a0I loved the sweet potato fries. \u00a0The server did bring us the wrong burger; but, we were kinda tipsy so we didn't care. \u00a0Whatever it was, it was also tasty.  Just avoid the steak tartar.  EDIT: I just talked with my date and another problem has arisen... apparently they over charged his credit card for our meal &amp; drinks. \u00a0Our paper bill was $90 and change, he tipped $20 (because he's a great guy) meaning our total should have been $110. \u00a0The staff at Horizon charged his card once for $110 and AGAIN for $86... Yeah. \u00a0Bad... bad... bad.  I don't feel so badly about writing a bad review of this place now.",

    "review_text": "If you are 21 and over, I suggest you go somewhere else. My friends and I came here last night. Cover was $20 which is experience for such a crappy place. We did not know it was an 18 and over club. And if you read the list below, you'll see why it was not worth the effort and money to come here.  Pros: None other than maybe you should come during the day to eat dinner with a date or something.  Cons: 1) on broadway , SF where there is absolutely no parking. Right across the street from Impala which is 100x better. 2) the dance floor is pretty bright. There's a lot of spot lights, but not much disco lights. The atmosphere felt like a restuarant/bar more than a place to go dance. The place is also very small. 3) The alcoholic bar is on the other side of the dance floor. You have to walk across just to get a few drinks, which I find a waste of time. Also there shots are actually less than 30mL ( the size of a full medicine cup when you take cough syrup), but they still charge you $10 for a pardon silver. I don't think 1/2 a shot for $10 was worth it. There's 2 people working at the bar, and 5 people at the counter waiting to be served and still, it takes about 10 minutes before you get served.  4) music is hip-hop, but it's a bit slower than what you can really move comfortably to. 5) Bar closes and the DJ starts playing slow jam at 1:30am. They turn off the music, turn up the lights and kick people out at 1:45am. Most clubs would assume you'll leave naturally when the music stops playing, but this one really do have people pushing you like you're a herd of cows to get you out before 2am. 6) customers here are really inconsiderate. Though the place wasn't that big, there was definitely room to move around. Guys would bump into you constantly knowing that they are in your way. \u00a0Out of all the clubs I have been to, no matter how crowded it is, my friends and I were never bumped and pushed around like last night. I felt comfortable everywhere else, but not here.",

The dancing area and the bar area were separated from each other so you're cut off. It doesn't help that the place itself is already really small for a venue.  There wasn't a coat check that night which didn't make any sense. When we tried to go outside to put our stuff in a car, we were told that you couldn't walk out and walk back in. UHH? So we hid our stuff in a corner and kept watch over it. How can you NOT have coat check for a CLUB night?  DJ was not that great so I didn't feel like dancing...I didn't want to leave my stuff unattended either. I ended up staying by the bar area.  The bar area is really small and has limited amount of alcohol. On top of this, the drinks were overpriced for what they were. 3 shots of Patron in plastic shot cups cost $8 each. Whattt?   I didn't really have fun here. Maybe it was just that night, but I don't feel like I'd ever back. Too out of the way for a place that gave me such an unsatisfactory experience. Not crackin'.",

Well, there wasn't anything bad per say; there just wasn't anything that was wonderful about the food or the experience. I ordered the portabello and oyster mushroom burger on brioche bun. The mushrooms were left on the grill for a few minutes too long; parts of it came out charred. I was trying so hard to taste some flavor to their marinade, but all I could think about was burnt mushroom = carcinogen. hmmm...The brioche bun was good though.   Initially service was speedy, but as more people trickled in, our waiter's attentiveness dwindled. Getting the dessert menu, the check, boxing our food, etc. took a long time. The chairs were not incredibly comfortable for a nice sit down restaurant. The were plastic chairs with mediocre back support....ones that you'd come across at a fast food joint.   I would go back to Horizon for their happy hour for drinks (the mixed drink that I tried was good) and for their PARMESAN AND TRUFFLE OIL FRIES!!!

I was dissapointed, although all of my attention was on my man, I love to people watch!   We started with the cheese plate, and calamari which was actually really delicious. My boyfriend had the ribs, and I had the salmon. My salmon was slightly undercooked for my tastes, but the tomatoe and asparagus salad it came with was DELICIOUS and perfect with the salmon. My boyfriend literally left just a huge bone on a plate, so I'm sure he enjoyed his. We had a complimentary dessert, and we went for the cherry cheesecake. It was ok. Pretty whatever.   The waitress was really nice, although I would have preferred if she had worn a bra :P Her goodies were ALL up in our faces!!   I LOVED the look and feel of this place, despite it being completely empty. The music was ok, I noticed they played a few songs more than once, which is the most annoying thing to me!!

There were at least a few people running around the club in sweatshirts/hoodies and plain white tees. Hmmm.  I think the food stops serving about 11 or 10:30. That sucks because I wanted to try the tater tots Yelpers rave about but we decided to order it around 10:30.  Oh yes, the bartend IS very cute. +1 for permanent eye candy.  DJ is okay. I got confused when he mixed OneRepublic's \"Apologize\" and the Eurythmics \"Sweet Dreams.\" Did. Not. Work.  Black leather couches in corners. The coat check is behind the DJ. Odd spot; older Asian woman looked very bored.  Also, I really want to point out this club is the most Asian I've ever seen.

The menu has actually got some tasty items on it. My personal favorite are the fries, but I am sort of a french fry addict. I love french fries. So when I saw they had a variety to choose from I knew I would want to come back a few times to try them all. I really like sweet potato fries, they are \u00a0becoming quite the ultimate weakness for me in my pre-wedding diet. Also their parmesan truffle fries are the bomb. I could order a cup of them from here alone for dinner they are so good. Their veggie risotto is surprisingly nice. Their burgers are just ok, I would do the sliders instead of the full on burger. It's a huge space so I can see why they had to utilize it as a wanna be night club. But ugh, Broadway just draws such trash. I hate saying it because I adore northbeach and like going out there. I can normally appreciate a night of bright lights, lots of distractions, loud music, dance club type scenes, but the people are just yucky over here so it's unfortunate. My last visit was for a fashion show event. A bunch of friends and I came in before the event for dinner. Our waiter was a doll, but slow as molasses. He seemed to have almost the full dining room to himself so we could tell it wasn't a fault of his so we didn't take it out on him. He was so apologetic and kept bringing us rounds of free shots (random, but ok, we accepted). Any who, it was ok dinner took a long time because the fashion show didn't end up starting until really late. Ugh, what an awful fashion show filled with some attractive guys that i felt bad for getting suckered into being part of this event and some beat up looking girls that were clearly not models but were up there anyway. So, back to the crowd. Some drunk guy kept getting up on the stage holding a full bottle of jack daniels putting his arms in the air like he was 'the man' or on a rap video or something. Give it a break, get off the runway, you are not part of the show lameo. Just a crowd trying to be extra wild, disrespectful and dirty. gross. That event has totally turned me off of ever actually coming her past 10pm. I will probably still need to get a fix of their fries every few months, but I will stick to their happy hour scene as opposed to the night time bar scene.",

Of course, it was your typical Asian party. \u00a0Not hating on the Asian parties, but y'all know how those work. \u00a0You got that one group of Asian girls dancing in a circle, drunk already, and the slew of Asian guys standing around them, sipping their grey goose and staring at them, mustering up the liquid courage to ask, \"do you come here often?\" \u00a0Except to be c-blocked by that one short brotha (who is obviously there by himself) to get him some Asian-lovin'. \u00a0  Then all of a sudden, at around 12 midnight, the dance floor is filled. \u00a0The dj yells into the mic, \"where all my single ladies at?\" \u00a0To which, a roarish scream comes from that one group of girls who started dancing at 9pm and have now taken 500 photos of themselves.   The music that night wasn't too shabby, it was your typical hip-hop, top 40. I even got up to dance, but somewhere along the line, the music stopped twice and it made the drunkies mad. \u00a0 I kept looking at my watch and after I felt like I got enough \"QT\" with the folks I came with, I peaced out!

I think they seem to be doing pretty well because the past couple times i've been there it was quite packed.

This is what we did. It wasn't awesome, but it didn't suck.   The one awesome thing about Horizon is that it's actually a burger place disguised as an upscale restaurant/bar/lounge. There are LOTS of burgers. Like, build-your-own Kobe, Organic, Lamb, or free range Turkey burger with such toppings as cheeses, truffles, and various other burger-y things, plus your choice of bun/bread. The possibilities are endless here. I was fairly inebriated upon arrival, which made navigating the many options on the menu extremely difficult. We went with the sliders. They are delicious, if not a little too bread-heavy. Skip the buns and you're good to go. The parmesan truffle fries are the stuff of pornographic food dreams. I would totally come back here and tolerate the place \u00a0in the name of those fries.  It's not that I don't like Horizon. I just don't get it. It feels a bit boxy and hollow inside and everything is very, very BLUE. I don't get electronic music + $20 burgers + drunks + dancefloor + seated dining. It just doesn't all add up for me. It's kind of like Circolo and I never liked that place either. I prefer an establishment that does one thing really well over a place that tries to do three things really well and falls short.   Front Porch's burgers are better and the environment is warmer. I'll stick to FP for burgers, my hood for music, and my front room for dancing. That said, Horizon is okay. I'd pop in another time for those fries and a glass of bubbly. But I wouldn't make this a destination.",

I can tell why it suits more like a lounge than a club\". \u00a0However, it was a cute, semi-romantic place just to chill and quick access to the bar on both sides of the room.  The place filled up quickly around 12am--crowd was mainly Asian with a few exception of 3-4 white girls. \u00a0Music was on repeat but they played some good songs along with some old school of Michael Jackson. \u00a0So, if you're not feeling the music.. just down some alcohol then it's all good!! \u00a0P.S. \u00a0There's one cute bartender here, so get at him and maybe he'll hook it up with a shot! \u00a0=)",

The stools/chairs are unique, but the rest of the vibe just seemed a little weird (the bathroom doors are cool though). The food is decent: The sliders were larger than I thought they'd be and were definitely filling (along with an order of pretty good fries). The Mac n cheese might have been my favorite though; simple with just enough cheese and crunchy bits. The drinks sound interesting but i wasn't blown away by the cucumber presse so I stuck with beer the rest of the night.

Seems like people only go there to stand around because hardly anyone was dancing and if they were they had no clue what to do. This place comes THIS close to getting one star.

I showed up with an open mind since I'm all about trying new restaurants. \u00a0First off, the tables and chairs are dumb. \u00a0The tables are high and so the chairs are high (with no backs). \u00a0I get the modern/minimalist look they were going for but comfort was definitely overlooked. \u00a0It was really difficult to scoot in since we were on stools. \u00a0  So when we finally ordered, the food took FOREVER to be served. \u00a0Food service was terrible inconsistent. \u00a0My bf ordered a burger and he got his food last (about 45 minutes - 1 hr after ordering). \u00a0I was done eating by the time he got his burger. \u00a0I had addressed the manager while we were waiting for his burger. \u00a0He told me that because they just opened two weeks ago and because we were a big party, that they were working out the kinks. \u00a0I was still upset and told him that it shouldn't take an hour to get a burger. \u00a0It was definitely a very frustrating experience.  The only good thing I could say about the meal was that my chicken was delicious. \u00a0It was nicely crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. \u00a0The fries were tasty as well. \u00a0However, a friend ordered a tofu burger that was terribly charred.  Despite a good piece of chicken, I would not recommend this place at all. \u00a0First off, comfort is lacking. \u00a0Second of all, inconsistency in both service and food.  Maybe they've worked out the kinks of large parties and being a new restaurant, but that has yet to remove the sour taste the wait time for a burger left in my mouth.",

The pictures on the website make this place look a lot bigger and nicer than it really is.   Once they open the club section it gets instantly packed. The dance scene was cool, nothing special. However I think they need to put up some better signs outside to find the place. The only way we could tell our friends where to go was to look for all the strip clubs. hahahaha.

I got to club at 8:30 and got in line, close to the front. The bouncer didn't open the door to start letting people in until 9:30. So we waited in line for an hour! I would also see employees getting ready, ice ect. \u00a0They were not ready. Once we got to the front door at 9:30ish they attempted to not let my husband in bc he wasn't wearing business dress shoes but I insisted that he was wearing casual dress shoe's and not sneakers (he was wearing dunhams). They finally let us in though at around 9:40. We went to the bar and ordered a our drinks (2) from open bar. The drinks were served in little plastic dipsie cups. we drank those and waited in line for another 15 minutes to get another drink but before we would get drinks they told us open bar was closed. It was 10pm. What a load of s;';';t, they didn't even open the door until 9:30. Common sense would state that if open bar was supposed be be from 9-10, an hour, that they should extended it from 9:30-10:30, since door didn't open until 9:30. Did I mention there was only one bartender, trying to serve 50-100+ people. It said on horizon website they were going to have 5-7 bartenders. I think this was their way of saving money on booze. Drinks the rest of the night were $9 a dipsie cup.  Moving on, the appetizers included those microwavable pizza rolls, warm cheese cubes, green olives from a jar, stale mini cupcakes and pigs in a blanket (which were pretty good). No sign of the chocolate covered strawberries, other than when I saw a waiter delivering some to a reserved table.   We got the nye hats and ball drop but never saw an champagne at midnight.  It was a big disappointment considering what we were promised by horizon but it was still a great night bc I got my husband to dance for the first time in public, he has been so self conscience. we are going to honolulu for vacation and he asked me if there are any dance clubs near our hotel!",

Broadway is tough, and to stand out among the rest, you have to some how be all things to all people ... problem is, few things achieve being all things to all people.   So, while they have done a nice job renovating the space and opening it up into a dance club, it's nothing you haven't seen. A shiny bar plus lots of modern black and chrome doesn't make up for mediocre food, not to mention uncomfortable dining chairs.   The sliders were decent and I have thought about ordering burgers to-go from their extensive menu of choices -- you choose everything from the meat to the bun to the toppings to the fries! But, the salmon was fishy, the potatoes were lumpy, and whatever else the group had was not memorable. Wait staff was nice and attentive, but proved un-helpful when recommending everything on the menu.  Less than impressed.",

This was by far the best burger I ever had in my life!!! It was juicy and spiced just right with a hint on mint \u00a0on a fresh ciabatta bread.

Once we were in, there wasnt a lot of people, though I did note that I've never seen so many bald asian men in one place.  By 11p or so, the place began to fill up quite a bit (with more bald asian men). I like the floor plan, though I'm not usually a fan of bars sitting in the middle of the room, but it worked here, as opposed to Fluid's layout. There was enough room around the bar for designated dancing areas and enough space for people to get by or just to stand around. Drinks were strong, music was good--could've been a good formula for a good night, but it wasnt.   There was a line out the door for the female restroom a bit after 11p. While in line, I get a tap on my shoulder...  \"Hey, can we dance later?\" \"Um, I'm in line for the restroom.\" \"I know, I said 'LATER.'\"  Anxious much?

The food was delicious and flavorful and I was so impressed that he came out (numerous times!) to visit tables and see how everyone was enjoying the food. He was charming and seemed to geniunely care that everyone was enjoying themselves.  A bunch of friends and Ihad made reservations to celebrate my 25th birthday. The plan was to have dinner at Horizon, made check out the lounge/club once that kicked-in and then head out to the local bars. However, we ended up having such an AWESOME time at Horizon, we never left.   However, the night was far from perfect. I had originally made the dinner reservation for 9 people, but when I realized more people would be making it to dinner, I called and left a message asking if the party size could be increased to 15. I didn't hear back from anyone for a few days (a bit disappointing) and then finally received a voicemail on my phone from who I am assuming is the Party/Event Manager telling me that it wouldn't be an issue. He left his number, said to give him a call if we had any questions and that otherwise 'we will see you this weekend...'  Well......when we showed up, there was only a table of 9 setup.....apparently NOTHING in the books showing the change in our reservation....this manager was OUT OF TOWN.....AND they told me they DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXTRA TABLES OR CHAIRS because they were fully booked that night.   WTF...are you serious!  Completely unacceptable. I realize it was not our server, nor the host's fault that no one communicated with them and I tried my very hardest not to take it out on them. I am VERY disappointed with management and their lack of responsibility. The host found us 1 extra chair, but we had friends standing during dinner. RIDICULOUS.   So has you can see, our experience was one of polar opposites. Great food, great dancing/music (4/5 stars)......very VERY disappointed with management and communication (1 star) = overall 3 stars.

We came by for Julia H.'s BF birthday dinner (I had checked it out already online to see the menu and it looked appetizing) and when we all walked inside, I was impressed by the interior. We sat down and I ordered a glass of wine and the calamari - J ordered just a coke.... and the wait began. There wasn't very many ppl in the restaurant so I don't know why it took 20 minutes just to get our drinks - in fact we were sitting right in front of the bar so half the table (after dealing with our server) just walked the 3 feet to the bar where they could get their drink in 50 seconds compared to what seemed like 50 minutes. The calamari came out and it was pretty good but by the time that came out (20 minutes after the wine came out), we all needed another round of drinks and ready to order. I chose the Mushroom Risotto and J got the Hanger steak, D and Dan ordered the Mac n Cheese, Spinach and Fries. I ended up trading my risotto for half their mac n cheese. The risotto tasted good but it was a minuscule amount of food - possibly 3 spoonfuls - the appetizers were bigger than this entree. The steak was great and the mac n cheese was to die for - I ordered an extra one for all of us to share but I ate most of it.  I wasn't overly impressed with anything and everyone in our party agreed - but it was great prices and certain entrees were delicious but I wish our server wasn't so slow and actually came to our table more instead of talking to her friends and hanging out by the machine.

We carried her out, and they didnt kick us/her out!! thank goodness, most places would.  also. terrible place for a venue. ): kinda sketchy place and parking sucks ass.",

    "review_text": "I honestly believe I can cook faster than the kitchen staff here... For starters, I ordered Salmon w/ a side of veggies - took approximately 60 minutes from the time that I've order to the time when it was placed in front of me. I'm fairly certain that with a half emptied restaurant, you should not wait an hour for a piece of fish and some grilled veggies.  The taste of my entree (salmon w/ veg) was plain dull, the only taste I can pick out from the plate is the lemon juice. The veggies were charred on the grill, way over-cooked. I expect a lot more for an $18 entree.  The waitresses here also can use some sleep. \u00a0I say this because a plate full of sauces (ketchup, ranch, etc.) landed all over my friend who sat across the table from me. The worst part is we didn't even get a discount on our bill.   Overall, the wait time is not reasonable, the taste was dull, and not getting a discount on the check after spilling a full plate of sauce on your customer is just out of this world.",

BUT what was awesome was this old asian lady who wasn't in clubbin' gear, but a big red puffy jacket. she was there to help out, putting away shot glasses; wiping the counter; putting glasses away. i went straight up to her and asked for a cup of water and BOOM! she gave it to me. later in the night I did it again and BOOM! she gave it to me! \u00a0the next time my friend went up to get some shots and we toasted it to her cause she so nice :)  thumbs up: decor! not cheezy, actually classy. huge place.  thumbs down: small exit, crappy bartenders, BROKEN BATHROOM! the toilets were clogged (which is no surprise for a club), but the faucets. the water was PURE HOT STEAMING WATER.

No matter what you order, you have to try the parmesan and truffle oil fries. RIDICULOUS. And not as oily as you'd imagine. For an appetizer we had those and the ginger hoisin cilantro glazed baby back ribs. It's the kind that melts off the bone, sweet to the taste and tender to the bite. Yummay.  I had the Washugu Kobe Beef Cheeseburger served with Lettuce, Saut\u00e9ed Onions, Tomatoes, and Cheese Fries. A bit extreme? Perhaps. But it was good. I expected a bit more from the burger itself (didn't have as much flavor and a little too moist) and the soda tasted too much like syrup, but I enjoyed the meal.   We ended with their signature fried brioche filled with Vanilla Ice Cream, atop Caramel Swirls. Um, that was a crazy dessert. Three of us polished one off and left quite satisfied.   So don't be afraid to dine here. Then you can stay for partying and boozing!",

    "review_text": "The liquor license debacle is over and Horizon is officially open! The corner of Broadway and Kearny is actually quite non descript for this place because everything around it is so loud. Since the space spans the corner and behind another establishment, we ended up walking through the back door mistakenly and thinking, this is the weirdest looking restaurant ever. So one of the bar waitresses set us straight and we noted our reservations to the hostess.  The place is sleek and slick. I felt like I was in a Manhattan club. Black on black, chrome/matte silver highlights, and the place is darker than most traditional steakhouses. The furniture is very modern and the high table we sat at had these crazy low back hydraulic seats. They're menus are still just black type printouts on white paper, one for drinks and one for the food. After looking at the cocktails, I've just found another scotch drink for my arsenal. Now I've been drinking Rob Roy's quite some time now and most bartenders don't know it or think it's an old man drink. Ok maybe it is an old man drink. I still love it nonetheless. Anyways, the scotch cocktail here is combined with a ginger syrup accompanied with a candied ginger garnish. Fantastic. I could have gotten wasted on these all night and as a bar/lounge alone , this would be a great place for just drinks. However the food was what we were here for.   After constructing our meals in our minds, we went with the following:  - Beef tartar  - Kobe Burger with Avocado, Swiss+Bleu Cheeses, on Brioche - Cold Stone Farms Beef Burger, Bacon, Truffle Cheese on Brioche - Parmesan Truffle Skinny Fries - Sea Salt and Herbs Fries - Creme Brulee - Ice Cream Sandwich  The beef tartar was served with a quail egg, cornichon, parsley, onion, worcester, dijon sauce accompanied by mini toasts. Fantastic flavor. We could have eaten a few orders of this for our meal. Our burgers and fries came out shortly after and everything was very flavorful. My only disappointment came in the fact that my truffle cheese was missing and they went over on my burger's temp. Cheese was an easy fix but the overcooking made me sad. Especially for a place that is touting itself as a burger bar. Luckily it was still tasty, albeit lean, and I think the experience would have been excellent if not for this hiccup.  The servers were very French as were many of the touches to the food. \u00a0Even the coffee was served in a French hand press. The place wasn't too crowded at first but started to pick up around 9pm. We were definitely taken care of and were happy with our meals. I just wish I could have had my rare burger as requested but I'm willing to go back and give it another try. As I said before, I would be willing just to go for the drink and lounge atmosphere alone. 4.5 stars.  --------------------------------------------------\u00ad--------------------------------------- Update 10/30/2007  Got a call from the guys over at Horizon saying that they're having issues with the liquor license so they've delayed opening to the latter half of Nov. --------------------------------------------------\u00ad------------------------------------------- Another addition to the custom burger craze going on recently, offering meat choices of beef, lamb, chicken, and fish. In addition they'll have a variety of comfort foods to boot. They were slated to open in Sept but will be opening in November.",

The other food choices are wonderful, too: fall-off-the-bone ribs, awesome macaroni and cheese, and lovely garlicky spinach to suck up the bad artherosclerosis conscience. The staff are extremely friendly and accomodating. The one star deduction is merely for the interior decorating - somehow the black walls and chrome and black furniture are sadly early nineties. Some warmer woods and less in-your-face-cool lounge decor would make it more inviting. I always have to steel myself against the weird atmosphere the place creates - but everything else almost makes up for it. And did I mention the unbeatable happy hour prices? Definitely joy inducing!",

I'd probably have more to say were it not for the second fact. Sorry.  I can tell you a fair amount about the restaurant though. The build-your-own burger appears to be the focus here; You pick your bun, meat, and toppings from a list of premium offerings. It will run you around $12-13 depending on options. The slider plate is worth a look too.  The bartender is quick and if you're ordering wine, the pours are generous.   The place is all black marble and mirrored countertops; It almost feels like a high end strip club without the dancers (I'm guessing on this; I know little about strip clubs or anything high end for that matter.) Not really my scene and Broadway is kind of out of my neighborhood, but it's worth checking out if you're around.",

The food was excellent, and my seafood pasta was great. Apparently, the mussels ordered for appetizers were \"really good,\" and because I trust my friends, you'll have to trust me too that they were just as good.  However, despite pretty good food, the after-dinner hours conversion into a lounge and/or club was pretty horrible. The only thing that impressed me was the quickness of our orders at the bar, and the fact that the bartenders were cute. Other than that, I don't think I'll come back here the next time I'm in the City. Plus, it had to have been open-night mic or something because their \"performers\" were pretty horrible.",

WRONG. people were sparse and the crowd that was there was just so random. a few asian girls standing around, some white middle aged women dancing and looking like they were having the time of their life, and a few hispanic guys sitting at a table people watching. me and the bf's first thought, \"wth lets get a drink.\" we ordered 2 vodka pineapples for $7 a drink. i'm thinking $7 thats not bad. but then we get our drinks and they were SO tiny. and let me just say that i'm a light weight, and im usually good off of two drinks. well the drinks didn't taste like pineapple or vodka. it kind of just tasted like water. after that, i refused to spend any more money on watery drinks. we only ended up staying for about an hour and a half and the crowd didn't get any much better.   with all the places to go to in the city, i doubt ill come back.",

I'm not sure if this is really true or not but some guy told me this place is an 18+ spot. It's a very wide open space with two sides of the bar catering to both sides of the lounge. It has the loungey feel to it but there isn't much to lounge on.   We stayed in the back where the 21+ spot was and there were luckily a few tables and booths and stools around. The bartenders all looked young but they poured some pretty stiff drinks. I guess we came on a really bad night because the crowd was looking pretty sad. And by sad I mean there wasn't much of a crowd. The bathroom totally grossed me out but what nightlife venue isn't unsanitary? They didn't have any paper towels to dry off your hands. All they had was a wet towel which looked totally nauseating.  We probably stayed not even an hour before we decided it was time to leave. Come here for the drinks but leave immediately to another club/bar/lounge if you want to keep the good times rolling.",

Fortunately, Horizon was able to seat all 20 of us and I found a spot not too far away.  While a lot of folks ordered a full meal, I stuck to more traditional bar food: wings and fries. \u00a0The chili wings were decent but I would have preferred them more spicy than sweet. \u00a0The crack fries (Parmesan and Truffle Oil) lived up to the hype and almost had me ordering another basket or two.  I can see why Horizon has gotten so many positive reviews. \u00a0It's a fun place to grab a quick bite and have a couple drinks, and the happy hour specials are pretty good. The huge draw back for me is the location -- the place is good but not enough for me to endeavor the North Beach area.  On my way back to the car, I had to pass by a couple of strip clubs. Now why did each and every one of them have to offer me a guest pass? I guess walking by myself and wearing a black trench coat really didn't help. But do I really look like a flasher slash perv?

    "review_text": "I first went to the Horizon about three months ago, and have no complaints with the food, its excellent. I have returned a few times with my employees and friends to see what all these poor reviews are about. As owner of a successful restaurant, I took notice to several things most customers probably overlooked. What I see isn't poor service, I actually feel bad for those girls. What I do see is upper management struggles, way too much micromanaging, a small kitchen, and not enough employees at times. Weekends seem to be overbooked and under staffed. Multiple large parties are great for business when you have all the tools to accommodate them, and trust me its not easy. I was in the same boat about 15yrs ago. Which is why the Horizon hit so close to home my first time there. I see a kitchen that just can not produce the demand, and the struggle of servers trying their best to hold it all together from the front of the house to the back. You guys have potential to be successful but some advice for you is, set yourself up to succeed. Break up your reservations, set up big parties in your lounge, create a \"Party Menu\". \u00a0I don't know who is in charge of ordering and stocking food but someone needs to be! Every time I have been there my server informs me you are out of something. Okay once in a while at the END of the night but at 6-7PM! Come on guys, what would you think if you were the customer! I wish Horizon the best of luck, stick together , you guys can do it.

    "review_text": "My friends and I came here for the NYE party (Dec 31, 2013). We all bought the all-you-can-drink \"VIP\" tickets ($59.00 ($62.06 w/service fee), general adm. was $20.00 ($21.69 w/service fee), which really turned out to be a mistake.  This place is understaffed, and the staff they have is poor. Here's the full picture:  We arrived around 10:30 p.m. and wanted to check our coats. We waited by the coat check for about 3 minutes, but no one was there. Eventually a bus boy passed by and we asked him where the coat checker was -- he told us they had quit that night. Based on other reviews people have written, my guess is that they just didn't have it open. So we carried our coats around most of the night. Sidenote: This place is pretty small, too. So don't be surprised when you thought you were going to some big party. Also, they never announced who the DJ(s) would be for the night; the music was pretty average.  When we finally got around to getting drinks, we went to the \"VIP\" section, which is just the smaller bar in the back. There was only one bartender serving 25-30 people. So there was plenty of waiting for drinks, averaging around 10-15 minutes per round. I complained, noting that this was nonsense, since we had paid \"the premium price\" but were receiving \"less than average service.\" We put up with this until 11:59 am.  In the middle of the dance floor, there was a bag full of balloons suspended from the ceiling. At 12am (Happy New Year!), a staff member pulled on a string to attempt to release all of the balloons (about 20 of them). The result was that the entire bag came down, and no balloons came out. Brilliant execution.   Following that fantastic countdown, we went back to the \"VIP\" section and ordered drinks. I tried to take my drink out of the VIP section (something I had done 3 times already that very same night). The small female \"SECURITY\" guard told me that I couldn't do that, and that she \"already told me that.\" I explained that she had never told me anything about that, but she insisted that she knew who I was and that I was trying to trick her. As a result, I told her that she, like everything else about Horizon, was terrible. Her response, \"alright, that's it, you're out of here.\" She crushed the cheap plastic drink in my hand and started pushing me. I didn't really bother fighting, since it wouldn't have been much of a fight. She was about 5 feet tall.   So I got kicked out of Horizon on New Year's Eve, and it was probably for the best, because I didn't have anymore patience to deal with such absurd, sub-par service. It was a total waste of money, and I hope that you think twice before supporting this business.   Read other people's reviews; there is a general consensus that this place is poorly managed/staffed, and the service is whackaroni &amp; cheese.",

We had our name on a list and the bouncers did a poor job of handling the crowd... that said it was time to leave. Headed down a couple doors and ended at the Horizon Lounge. It was around 11 pm so we probably beat the crowd that would show up later. The cover was not $20.00, it was $15.00 and they had vodka specials for $5.00. The vodka was not Grey Goose or the Ketel One but it was a San Francisco locally distilled concoction...Hangar One competition.  The bartenders poured some good drinks, not weak and they were on top of their game. I liked the floor plan of this club, there was actually room to talk, sit and dance. The club was crowded but not jammed packed. Some of the ladies needed to handled their liquor a little better. Did not try any of the appetizers or food.  Worth coming back to....",

    "review_text": "OK, this review is a bit overdue. I generally wouldn't expect to come to this area for a good dining experience. Maybe because I think of it as the strip club and clubbing area. \u00a0Nevertheless, we came to Horizon for dinner.  And apparently the menu has already changed a bit (something about no more ribs?) \u00a0Which is too bad, because the ribs were just crispy enough on the outside and yet they are fall-off-the-bones soft.  I had the lamb burger. \u00a0As a fan of lamb, I was pleasantly surprised. \u00a0It was HUGE, too. \u00a0So while some others in my party had the sliders, I didn't want any beef take up room in my tummy that was reserved for lamb. \u00a0My wife did love the sliderse, though.  The parmesan fries were awesome - and they were even still good the next day after I put them in the toaster oven. HAH! \u00a0Garlic fries could have used a bit more garlic, but then again I'm a big garlic fan and I don't mind smelling bad as long as it tasted good. So maybe for the majority of folks it would be a good amount of garlic.  I didn't order the appetizers so I don't know exactly what else we had. We were a party of eight so the party ordered several appetizers. There was that one with the raw fish in what looked like a martini glass or something. That was my favorite one.  Now, going back to the lamb burger, the only problem with lamb burgers in general is that with all that bun and condiments and whatnot that goes in a burger, the wonderful taste of lamb gets a bit buried. That's why I'm always a bit wary of such things. \u00a0Considering how well the ribs turned out, I'm sure the chef can whip up some awesome lamb that'll fall right off the bones too! (hint hint).  As for the lounge, the four stars has nothing to do with it. The lounge is very hit-or-miss. \u00a0We went a few weeks ago for a birthday party and it was never very crowded, so we ended up leaving at about midnight. \u00a0Then, more recently, we decided to hang out after dinner. \u00a0It got crowded with the quickness. \u00a0Both times were random weekends without any special events, as far as I know.   There used to be Asian parties out here but I'm not sure if they do that anymore. So if you happen to come on an Asian night, there'll be a bunch of Asians, of course. Otherwise, both nights I went there was a mix of people - but the crowd seemed to trend toward being a little bit thuggish. Not my crowd.  Four stars because I'll come back for dinner if I'm headed to this area for clubbing anyway. \u00a0However, these four stars does not reflect the clubbing experience.",

I had been dying to try this place, and \u00a0made a reservation for New Years Eve. The night went from strange, to bad...to worse.   Starting things off...it was a tasting menu (Which I LOVE) and so, \u00a0we proceeded to order all courses at once...because they even gave options(which I also LOVE)! So, we order our food and our drinks...we were on our second course before a drink came. Now, our server, having forgot our drink attempted to make up for things by continuing to bring drink after drink...there were no less than 2 drinks per person on the table at all times, kind of strange, but welcomed. \u00a0So, we have our drinks...we waited quite awhile for our final course, after being rushed through the previous...though, just as we're finishing our meals and sipping our drinks....WE GET KICKED OUT OF OUR TABLE. Yes, that's right KICKED OFF OF OUR TABLE. The hostess approaches us and asked us to get up. We hadn't even had our dessert yet, we still had full drinks on our tables...we both just starred in amazement. She informed us, that dinner was no longer being served because the restaurant was changing into a club and the space that our table was currently occupying was to be the dance floor. So, we were kicked out of our seat...and then presented a bill while being told to \"wait at the bar to finish our drinks\".   So, we did not get our dessert (which, btw is my favorite part, and I normally eat first), we got KICKED out of our table...because of THEIR timing...we had a reservation, don't take the reservation if you don't have time to feed us... it was all so strange, and we still shake our heads about it.   Now, the reason for the stars-- the food we actually got to eat was pretty great, and no complaints there...I just wish I wasn't rushed through my meal, denied, and kicked out.",

I would say I was not impressed and wouldn't go back.  When we sat down, me and my friends noticed that the lobster and the Foie Gras were not on the Menu and we were wondering why. They said it was because they didn't have it. Not that we would put lobster on the burger. But we wanted to see how a burger would taste if we put Foie Gras on there. As I look closer at the restaurant menu, it was very different from the one shown on web.  FOOD -  1) Beef Tartar - my friend said that it was over seasoned and couldn't taste the beef. Often times, restaurants over seasoned the beef because it is not fresh. But we are not sure.  2) Burgers - I had my Angus burger and it taste like charcoal (bitter and not seasoned). So, that's that. My friend thinks the Tofu burgers tasted pretty well seasoned.   3) Fries- The Parmesan and Truffle oil fries was really good. I was in love in them. \u00a0The Fleur De Sel and Herbs fries was ok.  SERVICE-   The waiter who took our order was pretty nice with a French accent.  However, the food took a really long time to serve. We were famish when the food arrived. When the food the being served, the waiter with a Mexican accent didn't know which dish was which and mentioned all the dishes incorrectly. On top of that, we were confused because we don't really understood what he was saying. When we did figure out our dishes and finished it, it took a long time to get the check and process all bills.",

I don't know how much they normally charge  overall: \u00a0i think its a great place to come with a group of friends for a chill evening if you don't feel like dealing with ridiculous lines, expensive covers, and a mass of sweaty people crammed onto a dance floor. i'd enjoy coming again",

By 7:45 there was a few other tables I noticed most of us were using the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> coupon. Perhaps an ominous sign for a restaurant considering it was Friday in hopping North Beach. \u00a0  Our waitress was friendly and on point the entire night. The food was surprisingly good. My partner had a generous portion of ribs. I had some kind of fish, I forget, but what I remember is the amazingly seasoned mashed potatoes. I usually don't even like mashed potatoes but these were so delicious! The cocktails were good too.   So where did they go wrong? \u00a0They didn't know how to calculate the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> certificate. It took about 20 minutes to get our check. We wanted to subtract the coupon, then split the bill between the two of us - easy - never been a problem before. \u00a0When we got our checks they were not split evenly, and a tip was added that we figured out to be over 20% - closer to 25%. \u00a0We always tip about 20% on the total of the bill before the coupon is calculated in. It's a shame the waitress felt like she needed to do that without any explainationa bout how our bills were calculated. The original bill was not incuded at the end for us to compare how it was split either.   I probably won't go back to Horizon. Good modern american food is not going ot draw me to North Beach to eat with a \"marina type\" crowd. I'd rather get some good Italian down the street at Tomassa.",

It also is pretty cool looking inside and apparently also some sort of club spot later in the night. So the food and ambiance are pretty cool.......  On the other hand it is in a somewhat questionable area but the main reason I deducted the two stars was because of a little cascade of events involving the bill.   We got double charged, then they couldn't credit us because their system crashed, then 3 days later they did credit us, but then mysteriously 3 weeks later we were charged again for the dinner. Very annoying, I don't want to have to watch my account like a hawk after I eat somewhere to make sure they bill me right.   Big kudos though to the manager Victoria who not only kept me informed of the whole process of crediting and such but then went on to comp us the entire meal for our trouble. She knows what customer service is and how to treat people. She is an asset to your establishment.   Go and enjoy the food......just watch your bill.....or pay cash.",

The club told our organizers \"as long as we show up before 11pm, we get in free.\" The majority of us showed up at about 10:50pm, went to the bouncer at the front told him who we were and that we were on the guestlist. He told us to go to the back of the line where we waited for 20 minutes (for nothing really, just to make the place look more hoppin), and when we got to the front they charged us $10 each to get in...pretty shady move.   \u00a0We decided whatever, won't let it ruin the night. We got in and ordered drinks and were charged $9 for the weakest drink I've ever had. Supposed to be Vodka-Cranberry, was 99.9% Cranberry juice. Even my just-turned 21-year-old sister who can taste alcohol in Mike's thought it tasted like juice. Stick to the beer if you order anything.  \u00a0 The music selection...terrible, wasn't even top 40 type of music, maybe a few top songs sprinkled in among the vast majority of rap..that most people hadn't heard of, and half the people didn't end up dancing to (no joke). Add this to the fact that they couldn't work the equipment properly and it was making ear-splitting screeching noises and I can safely say I will never go back, even if there was no cover. Oh and we only paid $10 because we were on the guestlist, if someone wasn't on the guestlist they had to pay $35 for this \"insert expletive here.\"  \u00a0 The only somewhat decent thing about this place was the bouncer who took away the prop that went with my costume at the beginning of the night went inside to retrieve it for me at the end of the night.",

BUT...  The food was quite good, and so were the prices. Prices were standard, $8 for signature drinks, and entrees ranging from 15-25 dollars a pop, and I believe appetizers and sides ranged from 6-15 dollars. \u00a0I don't know about other people, but the standout item from here were the famous \"crack fries\", your choice of fat or skinny, topped with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil. OMG soooooo very very good. \u00a0I was delighted to find that my chicken risotto was also pretty good, but the BFs steak tasted didn't really taste like steak. \u00a0It was actually pretty disturbing how it so closely resembled the texture of LIVER. EW. \u00a0The taste itself was good but the texture...i was soooo freaked out.   The only problem with the other stuff is that everything was super heavy and rich....after half my risotto I felt pretty gross. \u00a0I wish they'd make some LESS heavy entrees for people who don't necessarily want to clog their arteries.........

Okay, new name, same old face. \u00a0By the looks of it, this place still has the same crowd, same music as the old sake lab. \u00a0Sure, costs nothing to get in if you're there for dinner, but man....if you paid to get in here, you'll be a very sorry person. \u00a0Chock full of people who either:  1) \"Just\" turned 21 for the FOURTH time OR 2) Really just turned 21 and don't have any dance etiquette  The music was alright for the most part, but the ventilation was pretty bad and eventually with the crowd of scary guys, my friends eventually got out of here.   Thus, overall I;d say Id come back again for the food, but not for the \"lounge\" or \"club\" aspect of it ..... 3* for the food!",

(not food poisoning, just serious indigestion and overall yuck) --minus two stars.  The only star is for the bartender who let us know later that it was the chef's last day and as an apology, he refused to let us tip him (since they share the tips).   oh, the fries were actually really good, though. \u00a0I love that they shave fresh Parmesan over them.

    "review_text": "let me get my saturday reviews out of the way and pour in with my sunday reviews later this week ... care for a brunch idea, check my next review...   ***  2.5 .. not close to 3...  so 7 of us walk in, and of course, my k9 nose goes crazy and makes a comment .. \"ew, it smells in here ... \" my friend agrees and starts laughing because she knows how me and my nose and smell go hand in hand ... but whatevers .. it wasn't to the point like omg...  you first walk in, it's a decent place ... very swanky, mellow, kinda had the bocadillo feel with the tables ... dim ... it'd make a decent date place, but not necessarily ... it's like you step outside, and then you're back to sf's reality, but when you step inside, everything is okay ... \u00a0the seats were actually comfy, but by the looks of it, it's like, \"hey, it's nice, but it's gonna be uncomfy..\"  so we get our menu, and we see everything was filled with burgers galore ... one would never EVER think this place to be a burger joint ... I mean, they had salmon, chicken, steak and risottos, and stuff, but the other side of the menu was purely burgers.   I believe they had like 6-8 different types of burgers ... we all ended up getting their washugu kobe beef (Oregon) burgers for $15. WAIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTT, that's not all ... you then get to choose the type of bun you want -- for FREE of course, but the type of cheese -- swallows -- yes, you are paying extra sonny ... \u00a0  Chedder, swiss, provolone $1 but I got their truffle cheese for $1.50. what the heck is truffle cheese? It wasn't bad though... \u00a0  AND THEN, you decide what toppings you want, *nods* -- you pay AGAIN for each topping. Read below.  -Smoked bacon, sweet peppers, avocado, mushrooms, fried egg $2 each.. -Portobello mushrooms and proscuitto $3 each.  So basically you're grubbing on a $20 burger which is OBVIOUSLY NOT WORTH IT. Each burger is served with lettuce, grilled onions, tomatoes and fries... it's so true, better to make a trip down to LA and grub at In-N-Out.. i say LA because the in n out SUCKS ASS out in SF...   Ordered a fried egg for a risky touch FOR MY BURGER, but they forgot to put it on there, and after making a comment, the server comes back literally after half the burger was in my tums, \"do you still want the egg?\" NO DUMBASS, NOT AFTER I DECIDED TO WAIT FOR 10 FULL MINUTES WHEN TO REALIZE YOU WERE GONE IN THE RESTROOM DOING YOU KNOW WHAT... :X  We shared parmesan/truffle oil($7), classic fleur de sel and herbs fries ($5) which were SOO good.. the other guys I came with really liked the sweet potato fries ($5).. me? It was good but not SOOO good ...   We also ordered a side of spinach ($5) which was extremely garlicy, the spinach was drenched in garlic ... and believe me, I love garlic but not to the point of having liquidy garlic ...   lucky me didn't have anyone to smooch that night, or else it'd have been bad, VERY BAD -- I'm sure all of our pores were stinking through so it worked out...   the mac and cheese ($6) wasn't a hit but it was ok. Pretty bland, and of course I had to get me my Tabasco ... which def made a huge difference in my taste bud.  blah bla bla bla...  oh, and of course we can't forget their restrooms ... rather clean, but i actually fell in love with their art work ... they had a picture of audrey hepburn in a blk and white canvas, which is what i would LOVE to have at my next place ... in fact, the blk and white theme went quite well...  So yea, since Horizon is also known to be a lounge, we decided to lounge around on the other side but left rather quickly since the crowd was rather dead ...   Oh, now the KILLER ... I swiped the tab on my card, and I shit you not, I literally had to wait at the register for a good 10-15 minutes because they ended up swiping my card multiple times because the register was acting up ... i just hope, i hope* that they didn't ring me up 10x or else i'm not going to be happy -- it's one thing if my cc company is easy to work with, but to deal with this hassle of complaining that i was rang up 10x = $1700 -- i don't even want to think about it ... later, the manager came up to me, apologized and offered to get me a drink and gave me 2 complimentary dessert coupons for the inconvenience. I mean, crap, that's the least she could do because it was getting rather super annoying, so I'll be nice about docking a star for that, but still a $20 burger, and forgetting to put my fried egg I was DYING for is not cool...",

My friends and I came here as Plan B because Infusion was looking wack that night.   The bouncers weren't nice or mean for a change. He did a pat-down, which I noticed most clubs don't do that as much anymore.   When we walked in one girl is standing there stamping and another is checking the guestlist. Somehow we both got in for free (I was with a girl)  The area was not as crowded as Holy Cow or Infusion but was good enough. The decorations won't WOW you so don't expect too much.   My friend got drinks which took quite awhile... However, the AMF was pretty strong which is a good thing!  The dance floor is this long \"U\" shape around the bar. One cool thing about Horizon is that they have food for guest... I found it kind of sketch to free food at a club.   The age group was much younger. When I say younger... some clearly did not look 21.  **NOTE** I was standing outside waiting for my friends and I saw a group of 4 girls who were younger looking waiting outside. Then I see this girl come out from the back and told them to follow her through the back door I believe. SKETCH! Be careful when hitting on girls because they may be YOUNG!  When it was about 30 minutes before the club ended the lights got way brighter... They could have easily kept them dim until the last 10 minutes.   Overall, it was a decent night and I wouldn't mind going back. However, the pizza down the street was BOMB. Or maybe I was a little intoxicated.   Not too bad Horizon. I'll be back... eventually",

Fourth...poor security..I think like 3 fights broke out in the span of 1.5 hrs of being there...wtf?? \u00a0Im there to have fun and not get into a fight with some short ass asian dude trying to act hard. \u00a0There were alot or little asian dudes acting hard (guess its the short man complex)....I used to be a \"bouncer\" before and can pretty much spot all the bad apples and this place didn't know how to control their own crowd..its laughable and bad. \u00a0They should have at least 2 guys roaming each dance area.  Fifth...Looks like I'll never come back there and make sure none of my friends go there...unless we're getting in for free...it's not worth the money I spent there...$100 bucks on drinks and $20 cover...whoever the owner is; you just lost a customer that has alot of other friends that spend that much on drinks each...  I was there with 4 other friends that spent that much that night and complained to me that they dont ever want to go there unless they get hooked up. \u00a0Next time we're hitting up the other places to spend our money. \u00a0Save your money folks...just my opinion",

    "review_text": "Horizon presents itself well. The interior atmosphere is lovely and the wait-staff is wonderfully polite and friendly. But everything falls apart after that. I recently ate dinner there with a group of about fourteen people. It took the staff about thirty minutes to actually come to our table to take our order. After finding the restaurant was disappointingly bereft of a few items on their menu, we ordered our drinks, appetizers, and entrees. They brought entrees to about three people. Then a pattern swiftly arose: every fifteen minutes another three to five individual items would arrive at our table. Many had finished eating entirely before everyone had received their plates. Moreover, most of the appetizers arrived after the meal entirely. The appetizers were also the only food of any quality. A few of us ordered the \"seafood pasta\" which boasted a rich variety of seafood: including shrimp, calamari, scallops on risotto with spinach and tomatoes in a lemon creme sauce. The reality proved to be flavorless shrimp and calamari afloat in a lukewarm sea of \u00a0lemon-water, with modest bits of spinach, bowtie pasta and macaroni elbows trying not to drown. I ended up eating mostly appetizers. When we asked about the missing ingredients we found that the restaraunt was simply \"out\" of them, along with nearly half of everything else on the menu including the glass of wine I ordered, which, I had to ask about halfway through the meal. The establishment, again to their credit, apologetically gave us a 10% discount on our $400+ bill. I wish friendly staff and sleek, minimalist modern styling was enough to warrant a higher rating, but frankly my experience at Horizon was awful. I strongly advise you to avoid it at all cost!",

Tonight we brought back an entourage of friends and coworkers. We pretty much ordered the whole happy hour menu and then some.  Sweet chili chicken wings - good, but not overly impressed Onion rings - fried goodness Truffle fries - sooo good, must have Calamari - twas good last time, this time was a bit soggy Barbeque ribs - I personally did not try this, but my friend's face spells good. Sliders - good, but you only get 1 Mac N Cheese - superb, must have  PAMA kiss was really good. Mango mojito also really good.  Service was superb. Mark is awesome. :D  I don't enjoy the chairs at this place.",

Given I had a few weeks to pull this event together and ensure our guests would have a fantastic time, I relied heavily on the Lounge's manager, Ronnie. \u00a0This manager was fantastic to work with and was very accommodating. \u00a0Each time I'd talk to him prior to the event, he assured me that everything would be perfect; Ronnie's great to work with and he even asked me to call him any time of the day if I had any sort of last-minute requests and/or questions.   Ronnie worked closely with Chef Christopher, who created amazing appetizers for us that evening -- many of my guests are still gushing over the port poached pear with a honey lavender goat cheese crostini -- believe me, it was heavenly.  The atmosphere was great and the guests had elbow room to actually converse and see product demos first hand.  That evening we had our event, the new TV series Trauma was being shot across the street so it made for an interesting night. \u00a0For those who are not used to coming to this side of the City, believe me it's totally worth the commute!",

Next, the place was empty on a Saturday and if that doesn't indicate something negative about the place then I don't know what does. \u00a0Despite the fact that it was empty, they still sat us in an awful little corner from which I had to stare at the Adult video store and loiterers across the street.  The service was uncomfortable and pretty amateur. \u00a0Bus boys were constantly hounding us to see if they could take our plates etc...  The food was completely unremarkable. \u00a0Even my Kobe Beef burger wasn't that good. \u00a0BurgerMeister, a little burger place near my house, has better burgers that are less expensive. \u00a0I ordered 2 Manhattans and they were not as good as they should have been at a place lauded for it's cocktails.

    "review_text": "Restaurant Review only! This place would not have gotten four stars had it not be for Chef Christopher Lee. Compliments to you, Chef!  We failed to make it on time to the preview screening of \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\". Sigh. George Clooney, you're the only old man that can make me swoon... Okay, aside from being chronically late to anything and everything, we missed Happy Hour at 4th Street Bar... Sigh. Until we stumble upon a revelation: \"I'm craving crack fries.\" says Priscella T. \"Okay, let's go get some.\" says I, off to Horizon.  I walk in and try to wave down the hostess to let her know that we have arrived. Tada! I don't know if it's the dimly lit restaurant or the fact that the walls were painted black so it is really hard to see anything, let along tiny me. Well, she eventually sees me but does not acknowledge the fact that we have walked in, until she was done talking to the bartender. WTF?! After that, she directs us to a wobbly table and seats us, upon realizing the table was super wobbly, she moved us to another table.   We ordered from the 3-course prix fixe meal to share amongst the two of us and let me tell you, the portions are pretty damn good for a 3-course.  For the appetizer we had the Sampler consisting of Parmesan Cheese Truffle Oil Fries (aka Crack Fries because they are so addicting and delicious; you experience withdrawal symptoms when you're too far away from them), Tater Tots, Buffalo Wings and something I'd like to call \"An Array of Fried Something\"... I can't honestly tell you what that \"Fried Array of Something\" was, but I can tell you it was edible so I ate some of it... Haha. Um, leave it to me to just devour anything that's placed on a plate in front of my face. We couldn't finish this because the portion was sooo big.   Oh yeah, my Sparkling Pineapple Lemonade and her Watermelon Lemonade finally made it's way to us. Mind you, the restaurant was EMPTY at this point. No patrons at the bar, no patrons having dinner, just the two of us... It felt a little eerie. The drinks were both refreshingly, good, but I think mines lacked pineapple juice to begin with, but not knowing how the drink tastes, I thought it was supposed to be like that... Hmm, go figure. The Watermelon Lemonade was made to order and I ended up liking it more than my Sparkling Pineapple Lemonade, sigh. I always end up liking something someone else orders... ]= ALWAYS! We saw them use watermelon puree straight from a blender. Yum!  At this point, the Chef brought out our Seafood Pasta.   Thanks for bringing us our entree and then checking up on us! My friend eventually wanted to trade drinks because her drink was too sweet and mines was sour. She has a sour tooth. She wanted the drink to be more sour, so when the Chef was at our table checking up on us, we told him that her drink wasn't sour enough and he immediately had the bartender remake the drink! What an amazing guy! The drink came back WITH pineapple and extra lemons! Hah. Damnit, I tried the drink the second time around and wanted a trade back, sigh. This ALWAYS happens to me! Ugh. Anyways...  The Seafood Pasta was drenched in sauce. I don't know about you but I love pasta drenched in sauce, literally, like pasta swimming in sauce. I don't know if it's just because I love soupy things like jook, \u00a0pho or won tons in soup. The pasta was cooked to al dente, just perfect. They were a little conservative on the seafood though, but the fresh cherry tomatoes floating around were really ripe and added a very nice touch to the dish.  Finally, we made our decision on what dessert we were going to have and we chose the Mojito Cake. Let me say, we made the best decision because the Mojito Cake was absolutely delicious and something I have never heard of before. The cake had a nice minty flavor without it being too overpowering and it came with a virgin Mojito Shot which my friend loved because it was sour.   Overall, the amazing experience was made possible by Chef Christopher Lee and tator tots. Who can say NO to tater tots?",

Decided to come here for my birthday celebration and thankfully they were able to accommodate a party of 25.  FOOD: Came here on a Saturday night. I love love loved the angus burger, lychee martini, FAT FRIESSSS!!!, creme brulee, and cheesecake (I caught my friend licking the plate!!!). \u00a0I got an angus burger which was perfectly grilled, swiss cheese was melted nicely in my mouth, and the ciabatta bun topped it off. It's the kinda feeling where the food is sooo good that you want to savor every bite. Worth every lil finger lickin penny. Try the lychee martini or cucumber. One thing that my friend pointed out was: Where is the Mediterranean aspect of this place? The lamb...thats about it.   Two of my friends had the salmon. One described it as \"excellent\" and the other \"simply delicious!\"  ATMOSPHERE: Half the place is a restaurant and the other is a lounge. Every seat in the restaurant was filled. They were a bit disorganized handing out our orders, but I guess that is expected with a party so large. This place has a classy, yet had a laid back feel to it. The location is convienently located across from clubs. We hit up Club Latitude afterwards. In response to the person who complained about the backless seats...I was worried about that too...but we were able to coat check our jackets and purses.  The manager came out in the middle to check how our food was. One of my friends said it was too dark (she couldn't cut her steak), and another had to send back her burger because they put a big fat mushroom on it instead of cheese.  You gotta get the FAT FRIESSS!!! I've been meaning to go back there just for those fries and then walk all the way home afterwards to burn them off.",

I were even given a ticket for my first drink at the bar- I ordered a Amaretto Sour but they didn't have DISARONNO. *sigh* Since I have never been here this review is solely based on my experience on the food and service as a guest.   We were served finger food and they were yummy. The mini burgers whether it was beef or vegetarian were tasty and juicy. I don't normally eat veggie burger but this one is yummy. The chicken breast on skewer has a taste of terriyaki sauce and ginger, the BBQ chicken wings were meaty, the deep fried prawn on skewer was very crispy; I think it was salt and pepper.. yumyum, the BBQ ribs is on the fatty side so it's greasy but nonetheless very meaty too. The dessert, I have to tell you, go for that chocolate truffles -- it's dark chocolate ie. pure decadence pure delight! The cheesecake was yummy too. And they have some different kind of french fries. One of them I tasted Parmesan cheese but my friend told me it tasted like plastic... lol.... we later found out it's truffle oil with Parmesan cheese. The same person wouldn't try the veggie burger saying they usually taste like cardboard. Given the fact that she has neither eaten cardboard nor plastic I took that as personal preference that has nothing to do with the cooking.   The staff in Horizon has done a very good job in keeping the food coming! They know how to deal with a hungry crowd.

I had bought a $25 certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> for a meal off $35 (valid for food only). \u00a0We were originally going to order off the regular menu (entrees were all around $15) but then found out that their happy hour is now 5pm-10pm Wednesday through Friday! \u00a0Everything was $5 only so boyfriend and I ended up ordering 7 dishes! \u00a0  ~ Beer Battered Calamari: came with fried asparagus and shrimp and there were at least 5 pieces of shrimp too! \u00a0Anyway, everything was seasoned really well and it came with a soy dipping sauce and a sweet chili sauce (the one for lumpia).  ~ Crab Cake: this was my least favorite dish. \u00a0It came with one crab cake and the texture was off. \u00a0The outside was hard and seemed more like a fish cake. \u00a0I couldn't taste any crab either =/  ~ Slider with Skinny Fries: mmM...the burger was cooked medium to order and the beef was very tender and juicy. \u00a0Loved the caramelized onions in it too. \u00a0FYI, if you add cheese, it's an extra dollar.  ~ Buffalo Chicken Wings &amp; Drumettes: our order came with 4 wings and 1 drumette. \u00a0This dish was decent...the sauce was more tangy than spicy and I would have liked it more spicy.  ~ Kobe Beef Nachos: best dish of the day and sooo worth it. \u00a0The order was huge and they even seasoned the chips themselves. \u00a0Toppings included: Wagyu Kobe beef, pico de gallo, nacho cheese, sour cream, jalapenos and avocado...very tasty =)  ~ Fried Zucchini: I love fried zucchini and theirs is pretty good but not worth it for 6 pieces. \u00a0I did enjoy dipping it in the nacho cheese sauce though ;)  ~ Jalapeno Poppers: I would've liked them better if the cheese inside was melted but they were still yummy nonetheless.  ~ Mojito: the flavors were very well balanced...deliciousness in a glass =)  Service was wonderful...our server/hostess, Jennifer, was very attentive and would periodically check in with us to make sure everything was okay. \u00a0She even went around to warn people not to park on Broadway after 8pm so people's cars don't get towed. \u00a0That alone deserves an extra star!  Anyway, our bill came out to a little over $27 including tax and the automatic 18% gratuity for using the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">restaurant.com</a> certificate. Since service was so great, we ended up dropping $30, which is still uber cheap for the amount of food that we had!",

It's has a modern theme to it, nice tables, bar tables, and chairs.. nice like couches on the lounge area.  I had dinner here a couple days ago, and let me tell you these burger's are pretty awesome! i wasn't expecting much from this place because at the time i walked in, it was EMPTY! NO ONE... during dinner time, that tells you a lot about a restaurant if its empty, but when i tried the food, it was delicious, the burgers were so juicy... nice toppings for the burgers, liike truffle, portobello and oyster mushroom, eggs, etc.. The fries were great as well, i ordered the Parmesan cheese truffle oil fries which was really awesome, GREAT FLAVORS.. but i would recommend the sweet potato fries.. really really good! I might come back and try the other items pretty soon.   Great service, very elegant, modern, and great food, just one downside is the parking! It's so hard to find parking!",

Once our friend had a crazy bday thing here and I think they had every appetizer I could imagine - including the sliders, which were pretty good.   I came here later with a girlfriend for dessert and the waitress was pretty nice and recommended a couple of good cocktails. I think I had a sparkling pear juice cocktail. They have dessert wines and rose here too (but not during the club). We had the dessert that looked like a large cream puff with vanilla ice cream inside that came with lots of caramel and a cherry (see picture). It was pretty good. Sitting behind us were three other Korean girls who were taking pictures of their food. It looked pretty good, I want to eat here next time.   We came back to this place as a club not too long ago. I came with two girlfriends and they let us in for $10 even though we were not on the guestlist, which was really nice. It's kind of crowded in here and the dance floor is not that big.

The event was a huge success! \u00a0Speaking for the lounge area, they did a beautiful job of setting up and allowing us full access to whatever we needed. \u00a0I had heard the food was amazing but couldn't vouch for it because I was busy hustling raffle tickets.  However I did return later to have dinner and meet up with the Chef Christopher Lee....THE. MAN. HAS. SKILLS. \u00a0That is all. I had the Kobe beef burger and all I can say is CHA-CHING! \u00a0It was money! \u00a0I don't think Ive ever had a better burger. \u00a0Patty was perfectly cooked and complemented with pepper jack cheese, avocado, bacon and this wicked awesome sauce that you have to get xtra on the side to dip your burger and fries in.  Honestly, you don't think you can eat another bite but then Christopher starts talking and your done. \u00a0He will describe in detail the fabulous dessert he's going to prepare and you'r stomach is thinking WTH?! But your mind is like what did he say about the fresh fruit tart with a sweet light pudding in a crispy flaky pastry? \u00a0 How good was it? \u00a0 Sooo good, I took pictures of it. \u00a0Yes, I took PICTURES of my food! \u00a0On my camera phone, I have people, people, landscape, Chef Lee's dessert, people, people, landscape. \u00a0   Ive returned a couple times more and the service, the people and the food have been incredibly wonderful every time \u00a0It's in a crazy part of SF (sigh, Broadway) but once you walk through Horizon's doors, you feel at peace. \u00a0The atmosphere is softly lit, quiet and soothing. \u00a0The perfect place to disengage after work with friends or by yourself.",

Other than a few people at the bar, we were the only ones there. Granted, it was only 7pm, but we stayed well past 8pm and the place stayed pretty empty except for a few other diners that popped in.  The menu on the website sound delicious, but once you get there the menu is less than a third of what the web has listed. I was super disappointed by that, as with a brand new restaurant you would assume the brand new menu is updated. Unfortunately, that's not the case here.  Boy had the Oregon Kobe burger, which he was not too happy with. He said it wasn't good, although he was comparing it to real Kobe beef, so... that's probably why he didn't like it. Anyways, I had the tofu burger \u00a0which was fried. Eh. And not very tasty.  The french fries were ok, but very over-seasoned and with way TOO much garlic. The beer selection and cocktail menu are really pretty good, and our server was very friendly and quick.  I'd love to say I recommend going to Horizon, although I would give it about a month before doing so. For the cost of our meal, I don't think it was quite worth it. They don't have everything quite together yet and it might take a few months to do so. I'll probably go back, but not for a good three months or so.",

    "review_text": "I was here for their Valentine's Day menu thanks to a friend's suggestion... \u00a0Who is going to turn down a three course meal and dessert in the city at a modern looking restaurant? \u00a0The experience did not match the price we paid for our meal though, and I somewhat feel disheartened that I have to write this boring review, but I am compelled to share...  The place looked nice. \u00a0They seated us right next to the window at these minimal looking tables with backless stools for our meal... I looked around to see that was the basic set up of the place around the majority of the restaurant. \u00a0Stools with no cushions and a minimalist looking table with minimal space to eat. \u00a0Great. \u00a0These people should definitely call me up later if they're looking to give this place a REAL facelift. \u00a0If you want to design an atmosphere in which you want people to enjoy themselves over a luxurious meal prepared worthy of the price you are asking for, you better be for sure as hell be able to provide a comfortable enviroment for oneself to dine in. \u00a0Enough of my bitching about the shitty set up. \u00a0Looks nice, but there's not much to look at - and when the food doesn't make up for what the place is lacking, you're pretty much assed out.  We were greeted and waited on. \u00a0It took a good minute for them to put out glasses of water while we waited for our chosen menu items to come out. \u00a0The table was so damned cramped, they constantly had to clear our dishes after each course - which was fine, but they seemed as though they were hawks snatching up our plates for the last morsel of food before we had the chance to sit back and savor our meal. \u00a0Uncool... \u00a0If you even have to ASK me whether I've fucking finished with my plate or not, that usually means, \"NO, I've not finished my fucking meal because I still have a fork in my hand... \u00a0Do not make me stab you to get that last piece of food I paid so dearly for...\"  Their menu for that night started off mediocre with oysters on the half shell [4 pieces each person?!], butternut squash soup w/ creme fresh [the creme fresh tasted more like a dollop of sour cream and the soup was reminiscent of baby food], and a steak and potato au gratin for the main course. \u00a0The steak was cooked to medium rare how I liked it and the potatoes were crisp and well prepared... the kicker for that meal just so happened to be the caramelized whole onions that was a part of the steak dinner. \u00a0I liked it a lot, but it wasn't enough - portion wise - to satisfy my dinner cravings. \u00a0  The chocolate sampler they had was CRAP. \u00a0It tasted good, but why the fuck would you give a COUPLE dinner ONE stupid chocolate covered strawberry?! \u00a0Think about it: I'm most likely going to be sitting across from my date, so don't you think it would be a little cumbersome to lean forward in your flimsy bar stools to reach across your table too small to accommodate all the various dishes we have, to feed my significant other? \u00a0The chocolate truffle was good, and whatever that little espresso cup was filled with too. \u00a0More would have been better... because it didn't taste so wonderfully rich and decadent to the point where I was happy with just the amount you shelled out.  They messed up my friends beer order by accident and the peach bellini's my friend and I had were alright.  Nice looking - but that is about it. \u00a0I'd definitely go back for the potato gratin steak dish if it were a part of their regular menu, but that might just be it. \u00a0 The service tried too hard to act pretentious enough to fit the price of our food, but was executed sloppily when we realized one person we asked for help did not speak a lick of english. \u00a0I do not fault the person for not being able to help due to language barriers, especially when he is the only one willing to notice we needed some service. \u00a0I blame the idiot with the phoney international accent too stupid to notice the table in the corner waiting forever and a day for their food. \u00a0The lack of service might have been overlooked if it were busy, but only half the space was occupied while they were trying to set up for their club event afterwards.  Parking was terrible. \u00a0We were glad to leave.",

I went into a buyers remorse after finishing my braised lamb shank. \"I could've ordered five #1's at in-n-out or 60 tacos from jack-in-the-box for the same price!\"  the music at the club/lounge was decent. a good mix of new and classic hip-hop songs with a few random reggae and salsa songs. unfortunately, the DJ played the \"good\" songs for only 30 secs at a time and then changed the song to something else just as I was really getting into it.  I would never hold an event or willingly choose to go to this place again. don't get me wrong, I don't hate the place or think it was that bad. but you'd have a much better night going to a real restaurant and then a real club after. not some place that doesn't do a good job at either.",

And boy you wouldn't believe the way it looks now! Sleek and swanky. . they must have spent a fortune remodeling this place into the well-polished ,upscale lounge it is now. My friends and I often go down to Broadway for dinner and drinks so when we finally saw the doors of this place open, we knew we had to ditch our reservations and try it out. The verdict: Let's just say. . it's been a week and I've already been there twice. ;D   When we first walked in we were greeted by the very friendly (and tres chic!) waitstaff and were given the option to sit at a table or at the bar. .so we opted for the bar, seeing as we were planning on having a few cocktails as well. Our server was great, extensively explaining everything and anything on the menu. . And without missing a beat, gave us the lowdown on all their SPECIALTY cocktails ;D (which I'll get into in a bit.)  I started with the Green Bean Salad and went on to a Kobe beef burger with Jack cheese on a ciabatta bun with the Parmesan Truffle Oil fries. . I don't think I put my burger down once. The beef quality was amazing, the bun fresh and fluffy, . . and the aioli was to die for. With my other free hand I was contently picking away at the magnificent Truffle Oil fries which were the perfect pairing to my meal.  . . . and just when I thought it couldn't get any better. . . the chef recommended dessert. . Cherry Cheesecake, also made in house. Ok, now before I go telling you how amazing this cheesecake was. . you must know, I don't like cheesecake. And I hate cherries. BUT THIS!!! THIS CHEESECAKE!!! . . has completely changed my views of all cheesecakes to come. Silky, creamy and absolutely delectable! I don't know what they did or how they did it. . but I sat and finished every last crumb of my little slice of heaven. . and I can promise it will not be my last. Definitely well worth the extra hour on the treadmill.  At the end of our meal, I was drawn to their signature cucumber martini which I had never seen or heard of before. I took the first sip and after having its refreshing, surprisingly very \"cucumber-y\" aroma wash over my palette. . I thought to myself \"uh oh. . careful now, alcohol is not supposed to taste this good. . you could totally get drunk!\" . . and I would not have minded! The bartender OBVIOUSLY knows what he's doing. ;D ;D  My friends also recommended the Skirt Steak and Salmon. As far as other cocktails, the Sunset on the Beach is a great twist to a familiar favorite.  I think it's unanimous in between my friends and I that Horizon is DEFINITELY going to be a restaurant we put into our rotation. AND IT'S \u00a0OPEN LATE!   GREAT FOOD! GREAT SERVICE! GREAT LOCATION! CONVENIENTLY OPEN LATE!",

Arrived around 6:30, and although our table was the only one seated at the time...Mark, our waiter, totally took care of us. Got to sample their signature cocktails (normally $9) for the happy hour price of $4 for wells and $5 martinis. The table agreed that the lychee-licious martini was the way to go... but I also really enjoyed my Mango Tango. Some of the other drinks were good, but for those who like really sweet drinks (Strawberry Kiss and Evening Boost).   We ordered most of the food off the happy hour menu -- $5 mac and cheese (AWESOMENESS!); double order of $3 tater tots (crispy goodness with a trio of dipping sauces); $5 chicken wings (good, but not traditional spicy wings), $5 baby back ribs (pretty good); and $5 mini slider with fries.   Happy hour apparently happens M-F 5-8pm... that's a quite decent 3 hours of happy... so you should go! Great cocktails, cheap food, good people! Ask for Mark... he knows how to do it!  MARK!!!

I admit that I had low expectations for the food, but I was just blown away. Everything was $3-$5 and was amazing. The ribs were so tender and had a delicious sauce. The mac and cheese was really great with the perfect amount of crunchy bread crumbs. The yam fries and chicken wings were both excellent. The manager even comped us an order of parmesan truffle oil fries that were piping hot, crispy and wonderful. Did I mention that the bartender also was pretty cool, very attentive, and whipping us up random drinks for the girls. We kept calling up our friends to come out and ended up spending a fortune on the discounted food and drinks, but it was totally worth it. We'll go back often.",

My first impression of this place is Modern,dark and elegant.   FOOD - is awesome! I like their fries (parmesan fries - I think that's what it's called) it was so0 addicting!!!  STAFF/SERVICE - are good! the waiters checked on us to make sure they give us good service and that we enjoyed the food/service.  PEOPLE/CROWD -The majority people in this club are asians (kinda makes me wonder why).   Parking is a bit of a problem here. It's really hard to find a parking space in San Francisco PLUS it's very expensive.  The place is very convenient to other bars/clubs and of course, the STRIP CLUBs!",

They were having some block party event where you get into either Horizon or Latitude and you could hop back and forth between the 2. The big group of us (about 10-15) went to wait in line at Horizon because it was shorter. The jerk of a boucer was a complete a-hole (the bald asian one). I understand that they had a dress code, but one of my friends was wearing dressy tennis shoes. The bouncer did not let him know that he was out of dress code. Instead, he stood on the street and yelled \"You can't wear tennis shoes. You know who you are.\" and just kept glaring at him. My friend was busy chatting with the others in our group and didn't notice. The bouncer finally came over and let him know he was out of dress code. Why couldn't he have done that the first time instead of broadcasting it to the whole street? We were trying to figure out the sitaution because one of our other friends had an extra pair of shoes nearby. The same bouncer came through the line and said my friend couldn't even stand in line and he had to stand on the street. He said he was asking nicely, although not once did he say please or act very nice. All he did was try to embarass people. I let him know politely that he actually wasn't being very nice about it, and he simply replied \"I don't care.\" I guess he was just on a power trip that night. Anyway, we were all about to ditch that place because of that jerk, but another friend knew someone and they actually let us in. And I might add that there were several people inside without a collared shirt or in tennis shoes. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it's actually a pretty nice place inside. The drinks weren't weak either. However, they did almost double charge my friend for her cover charge. A place that is trying to enforce a strict dress code shouldn't serve their drinks out of plastic cups.",

Picture it....a rainy Saturday evening with a bunch of friends and all we want to do is dance and get even more sloshed. We stood outside of Apt. 24 or whatever and waited to get in...finally out of total desperation and apathy we went down the street and headed into Horizon. No cover! Yahtzhee!  Music was bumping, demographic was mostly bridge and tunnel, but the drinks were served with a quickness and the dance floor was a decent size. All in all not too bad. Granted this place doesn't house the beautiful babies, but if you are trashed and or looking for a place to dance and not pick anyone up...then this is the destination. If you are indeed looking for the pretty honeys....it is Broadway. Pay and get play.  Bottom line for me - thanks Horizon for giving me a place to shake my groove thing with my buddies!",

But, the staff is a little too inexperienced, the decor a little too black, and the food less than tantalizing for Horizon to creep beyond 3 stars. Nevertheless, the hostess was a sweetheart, and along with the rest of the friendly staff + a to die for Kobe beef burger, Horizon turned out to be A-OK.   The menu is well composed and worthy a fourth star, but the execution does not live up to the expectations. The lettuce on my starter salad was on the yellow side, and my puny mussels not fresh either. Perhaps the cream sauce tried to camouflage this, but the lack of basic seasoning blew its cover.   From the fixed price menu, Eric picked out ribs for starters, which looked great! The meat slid off the bones, and he loved the taste too. The Kobe beef burger was a winner, but I admit, based on the reviews I'd read by fellow yelpers, I overestimated the truffle fries...bummer! Oh well, it only means I still have something to look forward to.  For dessert Eric picked the cheese cake option off the fixed menu choices (among flour less chocolate torte and ice cream). I couldn't tell whether it was homemade or store bought, but the chilled berry sauce helped.   Thumbs up on the good french press coffee, and in general the drink selection is good. The staff didn't know how to fix a Kir Royal, but the drinks from their own menu were good and didn't skimp on the alcohol. \u00a0  What I learned from this? Horizon is the burger place to go to in the neighborhood with a decent bar.  Note: Be careful parking curbside Horizon since all cars up the block on both sides of the street get towed after 8pm. Someone near our table learned that lesson the hard way, and the hostess told us it unfortunately is a daily show...",

Well, don't let the location stop you from eating here - the food is extraordinary, especially for club food.  Hubby had the Mixed Green, and I had the Spinach Salad to start. \u00a0His was quite good, but mine was terrific. \u00a0Fresh spinach, caramelized walnuts, a nicely sharp but dreamy- soft goat cheese, and oven-dried tomatoes all add up to a series of sweet/savory/smooth/sharp bites that are very pleasing indeed.  Hubby then had a \"build your own\" sandwich of turkey burger on sesame bun with goat cheese and avacado; mine was the chicken breast on brioche with provalone and avacado.  We opted to have skinny \"cheese fries\" for hubby rather than the house fries. \u00a0Folks, you've never had \"cheese fries\" like this - they were crisp but fluffy, and were generously dressed with truffle oil and parmesan. \u00a0They are addictive. \u00a0Our server rightly called them \"crack fries\" because you just want more and more. \u00a0The house fries that came with my sandwich were very nice - herb fries, delicate and perfecty cooked...but those \"crack fries\" were the bomb.  The sandwiches were a cut above as well. \u00a0The chicken breast in my sandwich was plump and moist, and avacado creamy and buttery, the brioche had been grilled, and it all came toether very nicely.  Even if you're not clubbers, do yourself a favor and have someting to eat at Horizon if you're in North Beach, like maybe the \"crack fries\".  You'll be glad you did (did I mention that you should get the \"crack fries\"?)",

The lounge/club has great potential. Decent dance floors (one in the front, one of the back), plenty of seating, huge bar and somewhat decent music. The floor is sticky, the bathrooms are small and the crowd was just bad.  Lots of random older folk celebrating their mid year crises. LOTS of random pervert guys, just waiting to pounce on some left-behind-poor-soul. Crowd was REALLY FRIGGN WEIRD that night, since a bunch of \"break dancers\" were breaking in the back room and they sucked too. Dress code, if there is one, was sporadic. Cute dresses here and there, and then you'll see the \"I'm just here for the hip hop\" crowd.  Drinks are okay, I think like $7-$10 per drink, depending what you order.

Not only does this place have good ambiance, but also good food. Came here with my bf to celebrate our anniversary. Shockingly, the place was kinda empty. there was only two other couples eating there. But with the economy nowadays, people aren't eating out at nice and pricey restaurants anymore.  The food here was amazing! there was a prix fixed meal that included appetizer, entree, and dessert, so we ordered those plus their parmesan truffle fries. The portion of the fries they give you is huge. We couldn't finish the fries at all. But it was delicious with the truffle oil and parmesan cheese well integrated.   Appetitizer: CAESAR SALAD: this was simple but delicious. the romaine lettuce came intact (not streaded) that held the dressing and parmesan cheese well. It came with anchovies...which I am not a fan of, so I just gave them to my bf. BABYBACK RIBS: my bf had this appetitzer and it was absolutely delicious! probably the best part of our meal. The meat on this braised rib was so tender and juicy that it came off the bone...thats a clear indication of a tender meat.  Entree: GRILLED SALMON: This was a decent dish. The salmon was cooked perfectly with a hint of pink in the middle, just the way I liked it. It came with mashed potatoes that were really creamy and smooth and steamed asparagus. KOBE BEEF BURGER: this was my bf's dish. It was juicy and a little undercooked for my bf (who likes his beef meat well done). It came with pepperjack cheese, bacon, and avocado on a ciabatta bun.   Dessert: FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE: I really didn't enjoy this too much. I mean...it was considered healty b/c of the lack of flour...but it didnt taste that good. It tasted like eating cocoa powder. I ended up eating my bf's dessert which he wasn't so happy about. haha. RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE: this was my bf's dessert. I'm usually not a fan of cheese cake, but this was really creamy and sweet w/ fresh raspberries. The crust was firm and crumpled in my mouth. \u00a0  The food was great and the ambiance was nice. the only problem I really had was my drink. I had one of their specialty cocktails and it was just wayyyy to sweet. But aside from that, I had a wonderful dinning experience.",

Past 11pm, this place felt almost more like a club rather than a lounge. I would recommend it if you are looking for a solid place to go dancing, without having to push through sweltering crowds.   Wish I could comment on the drinks/food, but I only had water. Cover was $10.",

The club isn't all that big and I don't like the layout or location of the club . They also made me feel kind of guilty going to the bathroom because there's someone in there that hands you the soap and paper towels to wash your hands . It kind makes me feel like I should or need to tip every time I go to the bathroom . It made me feel kinda bad cuz I didn't have any money that night . Oh , and their OJ tastes disgusting !! It tastes like unflavored orange powder + water .. yuckk !!",

I was on the event team and after having dealt with other venues for other events, I was blown AWAY by the professionalism, flexibility and cooperation shown by the lounge and restaurant teams headed up by Ronnie and Chef Christopher Lee.   Horizon is a chic little oasis in the center of the Broadway adult entertainment venues but don't let the location put you off. Inside it's elegant and comfy - with an intimate dining area a central U shaped bar that dissects the space and a sophisticated, modern lounge area.  The drinks are fabulous - perfect mojito anyone? Or for a fun spin try the scrumptious watermelon version.  And the food is lovingly served up by Chef Christopher who is passionate about simple flavors and fresh, local ingredients. Tender, perfectly seasoned calamari, mouth-watering parmesan-truffle fries and golden crab cakes on a bed of greens were all piping hot and served up immediately.  The burger I had was incredibly satisfying. And I've heard the mac and cheese is to die for and I intend to order that on my return visit. I'm salivating like Pavlov's dog, already!  Service is friendly and prompt. I really feel like part of the family here. Oh, and I LOVED the ladies' room decor! I highly recommend Horizon - for either a group evening or a romantic dinner for two.",

I met the \"General Manager Ronnie\" \u00a0who raved about Horizon and suggested we give them a try... So we did.... and we had a great time!   Our server was \"Nga\", who was very professional and was training Crystal a new waitress who was doing a fabulous job (go girl!) \"Crystal\" was attentive to us the entire night and helped us with our menu selection.... This is what we had and I highly recommend the following... yummy!   I ordered off their prefixed menu ( I was very hungry!)  I started with the  \"Mussels\"  Tomatoes, Basil, Chili, Garlic, Shallots, Cream, White Wine  Followed by their \"New York Strip Steak\"  Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Haricot Vert, topped with Oyster Mushroom Brandy Sauce  And for the finale I had their \"Fried Brioche\"   My husband ordered their  \"Pear Salad\" Watercress, Candied Walnuts, Gorgonzola Bleu Cheese, Sherry Walnut Vinaigrette \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(I had some, it is so goood!!)  And the \"Chef's Choice Burger with Avocado and Bacon\" accompanied with some really good Fat Herb Fries \u00a0  Beverages of the evening was a Sprite for him and I of course always like too order the house specialties - so I chose their \"Mango Tango\".. it was the bomb! It was so good that I ask for the Bartender's name so I give him some credit too on Yelp! \"Sim\", it was very good! Thanks   \"Ronnie\" thanks for the recommendation! We had a great time at Horizon's and will be back to try the rest of the menu out and the rest of the drink specials! :)",

    "review_text": "This restaurant isn't honest, and they have terrible service and use shady bait &amp; switch tactics.   We arrived at 7:40pm for dinner to find that it was happy hour until 8pm. We had planned on just eating dinner, but decided to get a bunch of appetizers and drinks first and then order our entrees at normal dinner prices. If we had extra food we'd just take it home.  We ordered our appetizers and drinks at happy hour prices during happy hour. We got the ribs, tater tots, and truffle fries. They were all great. Who doesn't like tater tots?  We then put in our order for dinner. I got the fried chicken and my gf got the sliders. We still had our fries, tater tots, and drinks, and were having a great time snacking and talking. We didn't even notice that 30 minutes had gone by.  After about 45 minutes, my tater tot order dwindling, the waiter came by and took away my dipping sauces. Then he came back and tried to take my tater tots, even though I wasn't done yet. I told him I wasn't finished and he walked off. I was a little miffed that my dipping sauces were gone since I still had a lot of fries left.  By now we were wondering where our entrees were, since parties that had arrived after us had already left. We knew we ordered a lot of food, but we planned on taking anything we couldn't finish home. About 50 minutes had gone by since we put in our order for entrees when I asked our waiter about it.  \"Entrees? Ohhh... you had ordered! Let me put that in for you!\"  We weren't too mad about this, it was an honest mistake. We were having a good time with our drinks and appetizers, so no big deal. He even offered to comp us our second round of drinks.  We got our entrees just fine and ate as much as we could and got the rest boxed up. Despite the poor service we had received, I was fine up until this point.  When the waiter came back with the bill he said his manager couldn't give us the happy hour prices for the appetizers! Even though we ordered during happy hour! I don't understand why the manager couldn't do this, and no explanation was offered. We were using a gift card that we had received, but it wasn't a coupon or anything like that, it should be as good as cash. The waiter just gave us this lame excuse about his manager and walked off without an apology.   I still want to know why we were charged full price for the happy hour items when we ordered during happy hour. What was supposed to be a bill \u00a0for ~$50 was ~$70. This is completely unacceptable, and combining it with a waiter who forgot to put in our order and let us sit there for nearly an hour without checking on us, is just the complete opposite of what a restaurant should be doing.   If you advertise a happy hour, and a customer orders during that happy hour, they should get those happy hour prices. I want our money back.",

    "review_text": "Even the nice decor, decent food, and yummy drinks couldn't save this place from getting 1 star from me.  I ordered the washugu kobe beef burger on ciabatta with swiss &amp; avocado and fries with parmesan &amp; truffle oil. The burger was good in the sense that it had high quality ingredients but it wasn't that tasty -- I was slathering on the ketchup. The fries were reallyyy good though. The lycheetini and cucumber presse are really good as well.  This place has a very mature, minimalistic modern feel to it -- very different, especially for a burger joint. However, they don't need to have a snotty attitude just because they're more upscale. And when I say they, I'm referring to one of the bastard bartenders.  Me: Hi, can I have 2 slippery nipples? Him: Sorry, I don't have stuff to make goofy drinks like that. Me: Ok... can I have 2 buttery nipples? [I've never had a slippery nipple so I was thinking maybe it was too weird or something... I don't know!] Him: This is a high end bar. How about I get you a cranberry f*ing something? Me: ...What?!! Are you serious?  Then he proceeded to leave and serve another customer without taking my order.   I have no idea why he gave me so much attitude -- it's not like I was drunk and being obnoxious and I definitely wasn't rude. I'll give HIM a cranberry something, stupid f*er. And I KNOW that the bar has the alcohol for \"goofy\" drinks because I had B-52s with a friend from another bartender there.  Therefore, I am never coming here again. Plus driving around forever only to not find street parking and then paying $15 to park at a lot makes this place even less worth coming to. Maybe I'll consider coming again IF and ONLY IF management gets rid of that douchebag or gives him an attitude adjustment.  *12/10/07 EDIT: Soon after I wrote this entry, I was contacted by the PR guy and a fellow Yelper informed me that the bartender was fired. I don't know if all of this was legit [my friend still needs to follow up on this because he knows one of the owners], but it's good enough for me -- I'm over it. They can have 1 more star, haha.  *12/15/07 EDIT: So even though I said I would never come here again... I actually went last night, but only because I was hungry &amp; really had to use the bathroom so yes, I had a $50 late night \"snack\" at \u00a0a place I swore I would never go to just because I wanted a clean bathroom to use haha. BUT this place is good! I noticed the pretentious prick of a bartender wasn't there (but he may have been on the lounge side) so that was a plus. And the food &amp; service were excellent. We ordered the skirt steak, salmon, and tater tots. I must say, Horizon definitely knows how to make their potatoes. The fries with truffle oil &amp; parmesan last time were awesome but the tater tots!! To die for!! We were still craving &amp; talking about them this morning, haha.",

Well I was appreciative that they had a coat check, even though I had no coat to check, lol!  The bathrooms were clean and really nice, oh and they had a person in thier to provide you with any needs, tampons, lotion, paper towels, etc.   I was very upset that I spent $20 on 2 Grey Goose and Cran's, is that steep or is it just me?  Oh and let me not forget to mention that the bar has about 3-4feet of counter space between you and the bartender, so you have to shout out loud to get the bartenders attention if they aint already payin attention.

It is literally one room with zero effort in d\u00e9cor/atmosphere with \"VIP\" (ha!) booths on one side and a bar on the other. DJ and sound system is weak...I can do better with my Logitech speakers and iTunes library at home. The few other occasions I returned to Horizon (was most likely dragged there kicking and screaming), crowd is NON EXISTENT. In the rare case where there was a (small) crowd, people would be STANDING(?!) on the \"dance floor\" holding drinks and chit chatting. Felt like I was back in the 6th grade at schools dances where all the boys and girls stood on opposite sides too shy to approach each other and be the first ones to dance. Oh but I cannot forget the time where they hired one (eh) go-go dancer to get the crowd going whom everyone ignored. I was actually starting to feel sorry for her dancing by herself faking excitement and trying to be...sexy..?  Horizon is a joke as a nightclub. FYI you will need A LOT of alcohol (which equals cash money) to have a good time here. Please stick to being a restaurant since the only decent reviews I see on here are of that.",
