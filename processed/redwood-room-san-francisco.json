I used to come here a lot for drinks, so I was excited to show it to some friends of mine who wanted to take me out for a birthday drink. \u00a0We came mid week, dressed nicely, and although the place was not busy at all, we were treated like dirt.  The main reason for one star is the terrible customer service and attitude we received all night. Here are some examples:   Once we got the attention of our servers (we had two, both horrible throughout the night) , she really didn't want to explain anything about the menu or the drinks.   We asked for the amazing blue cheese stuffed olives they usually have in their martinis (as listed on the menu), and received plain olives without any explanation.  I asked her at one point during the night to help me explain the story of the moving paintings, and to my surprise, she very rudely and curtly said something like: \"it's about some guys and girls ... and you can really just make up your own story, it doesn't really matter, you know that, right?\" and walked away!!!  And on top of it all, not once did they say a \"happy birthday\" when my friends stated that we came her for my birthday, let alone a candle or a complimentary drink, shot, or smile (not that I expected anything at all, but this is the only establishment that I've been in where on numerous occasions, someone refused to smile or say happy birthday to a customer celebrating a birthday). It was a bit bizarre.  These points might sound small one by one, but the whole experience throughout the night just added up to a bizzare and very rude encounter towards us. \u00a0As I mentioned above, I used to come here several times a year and always brought out of town guests by to show them the redwood room - given the horrible experience we had, I have not been back and have no plans to return.",

I don't care for the pretencious photo portraits that have taken the place of the Gustav Klimt large scale prints that at time adorned the walls here. \u00a0I can't figure out if the new photo portraits are put there as a self mocking joke of the very same business people who frequent the bar, or are they really trying to say, \"look how cool and overworked I am, I'm just like you, fellow bar patron...\" \u00a0 Regardless, the redwood paneling is still exquisite, and could NEVER be replicated today. \u00a0The room itself makes this a special bar. Drinks are expensive, but that comes with the territory. The lighting is good if you happen to have brought your military issued night vision goggles. \u00a0 The central lobby has some great seating areas, comfortable with good table service, take a seat out there, and get away from the thump of the bar for awhile, pretty relaxing. I have been in ian Schrager Hotels all over the world, and this one fits in perfectly, not quite my cup of tea, but this Hotel was almost on the scrap heap when he bought it. So props to him.  If you're hunting for a date, looking for a trophy wife, or if you have a thing for nerdy, balding, successful guys the Redwood Room is perfect! \u00a0Or if you just want to see a cool place to drink this could be it, just don't forget the night vision goggles.",

SIDE NOTE: Apparently this is a hot spot for high end call girls to meet or pick up old rich men. I noticed very young attractive women with much older, unattractive, out of shape men who looked wealthy. Didn't make a whole lot of sense until I found out that it was common at this lounge. So don't be surprised to see a 20 something blonde sliding her high heels up and down the side of 60 year old man's khakis while conversing in a flirtatious manner.",

The decor is dark hardwoods with large chairs, sofas and some booths. Very nice and truly San Francisco with the long bar and the large selection of liquor. The martinis and mixed drinks are expensive but they are smooth and strong.

Maybe they would have said something if she were a guy??  I like the fact that this place does not feel the need to charge a cover at the door. The music in there makes you wanna dance- but there really isn't any room to do that.  I am always here with my husband and a group of friends who are for the most part involved. So I can't really comment on how the single scene is here. All I can is that it sure seems impossible to find a long-term committed monogamous relationship in the Redwood Room. And by the more than occasional \u00a0sightings of people making out in the hotel lobby- it doesn't look like that is the type of relationship most people here are looking for.   The interactive art on the walls are pretty cool. I wanna be one of those portraits!  Overall, if you wanna go somewhere more dressed up than most SF bars than come here. Also be prepared to squeeze your way up to the bar to get a drink. Or try to flag a cocktail waitress and order a drink from here.",

We got hooked up with a table, and immediately had a very sweet waitress take our drink order. Every time we had an empty glass, I swear she was on the spot within 1 minute of setting it down. Impressive. And no, it wasn't just to get me drunk and molest me, like usual. She was actually just very good at her job.   The crowd varied in age, from early 20's to late 40's, but everyone was dressed to impress. It was certainly busy especially up around the bar, as can be expected on a Friday night, but since we were seated, we didn't have to deal with the crowds.   They were throwing down killer beats, and the only thing that made me a little sad was that nobody started goin wild and bustin out their dance moves. I tried to get things going with a pretty amazing robot, but twas not to be. Apparently it's more appropriate to stand still with your drinks and mingle, or stick to your table.

We went inside, got a couple of tasty but expensive drinks, and sat down with a bunch of Norwegian businessmen in their 50s who were in town for vacation. They apparently heard about this place from their driver, which gives you a sense of they type of guys that come to this place. We all had a good time, talking, flirting, and then went on to our merry ways.  I probably wouldn't come back to this place again. Just not my type of scene, unless I want to get ogled by older men who try to hide the fact that they're married with families back in their countries/states. (Some don't hide it at all; their rings are apparent.) Upside is, the clientele is mostly older and urbane, so conversations aren't dull. I might have given this place 3 stars, but my car got broken into that night, so I'm not feeling love for this place.",

    "review_text": "Got invited to a birthday party here. Having never been, I called the hotel in advance to find out if there was some kind of dress code (website is so fancy, it almost implies there is).  Me: Hi, does the Redwood Room have a dress code? Clift Lady: Um, you dress to be seen. Something sexy if fine. Me: Ok I'm not really looking to be seeeeen. Are nice jeans ok? Clift Lady: Sure and a sexy top. Errrr.. so we get there at 10:45 and there is a pitiful line about 10 deep. We're forced to wait. For what, I can only wish I never learned. Then a scroungy group of people walk up, sweet talk the bouncer, and get in before us. Bouncer says, \"yeah you guys are hotter but they reserved a table.\" Eek. So we get in and it's chaos. Like, SF is trying really hard to be LA and Vegas but falls somewhere in the middle... like a prom horror movie where all the boys suddenly start aging at a rapid pace.  Our group was trying to convince the birthday girl to change venues, but she was already well on her way to get another drink at the crazy-crowded bar. I left my stuff with some friends and chased after her, and a couple of people followed. She couldn't be convinced to leave, so while she was the only one out of all of us who was actually at the bar and able to get the bartenders attention- the rest of us were awkwardly pressed against strangers wearing axe spray- a friend who was behind me asked me to tell her to order him grey goose martini.. like we were playing the game telephone, only the one in our nightmares. She ordered all the drinks, somebody threw down for hers, and she left. So, being the tallest and most able to fill the 3\" vacancy she left, that made me the front woman in the group. I asked the bar tender how much the martini was. He started yelling at me..  Crab: \"YOU ORDERED TOGETHER YOU PAY ALL TOGETHER, NOT SEPARATE!!!\"  Me: I was merely asking how much, that's it.. Crab: I'm going to need to see your ID. Me: What? Are you kidding? How do you think I got in here? My ID is across the room with friends. Are you seriously going to follow me to get my stuff across the bar?  Crab: I'm going to kick you out if you don't show some ID. I rolled my eyes and walked away. Then, a man in a suit started following me. Suit: I need to see some ID. Me: Seriously? I'm 25 years old. I haven't had one drink all night and I don't plan to, this place is a rip off. Suit: Sorry, I have to see it. It's the law. Otherwise I'll have to ask you to leave. So I show him, and he says thanks.  Me: Yeah, thank your bartender for wasting everybody's time. Your man \u00a0is an as!*hole.  Suit: Yeah he has the worst job in the world. Thanks. HA! He has the worst job in the world? My friend tipped him $2 for one drink and 30 seconds of his time, even after he sassed us like a little cry baby.  Perhaps Redwood Room should consider carding people who actually look under 21 (25% of the female population that night), not just the innocent bystanders who refuse to buy a drink that costs $15.  2 stars only because the digital art and giant chair were semi interesting to look at while I was thinking of somewhere I'd rather be.",

Now a Manhattan you shake to fox-trot time, a Bronx to two-step time, a dry martini you always shake to waltz time.\" That's a clever line spoken by the martini-swilling Nick Charles in \"The Thin Man\", and it fits perfectly in the Redwood Room, as old-school San Francisco as you can possibly get in the Clift, a legendary hotel that was built in the then-popular Beaux-Arts style just in time for the Pan Pacific Exposition in 1913.  The Art Deco bar didn't come for another twenty years at the height of the Great Depression, and it still retains the theatrical grandeur of the architecture and polished wood finishes (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F15WZRTl&amp;s=2015b1ec430b9dfb6cd4ea5293cbb31a96a4ef44c0416758ebaea756a9c01df7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/15WZRTl</a>). I don't come often, but when I do, it always feels comfortable no matter how crowded it can get with tourists. It feels enormous with the vaulted ceilings and the brightly back-lit shelving unit of various libations (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FYAlHqB&amp;s=a317c0969572d955e39dea4b08852f95b12ea15e3d62b237ed419dbe9e08be55\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/YAlHqB</a>). Otherwise it's quite dark save for the central fireplace and the mood lighting on some of the unusual artwork that can be found on the walls.  It would be the perfect setting for an illicit tryst if only the house detective wasn't spying on us. Cocktails here are steep at $15 but seemingly appropriate with names that evoke a time when the boys were overseas fighting for Uncle Sam and the USO was in town. A Marilyn Monroe, for example, is made of Leblon Cacha\u00e7a, tamarind, coconut milk, lime juice, and a splash of cream on the rocks. However, a faux-sophisticate like me deserves a Clift Manhattan consisting of Bulleit bourbon, Carpano Antica sweet vermouth, and orange bitters. Straight up with no chaser please. Ah, very smooth indeed.  COCKTAILS - 4 stars...pricey but the ideal mood setter AMBIANCE - 5 stars...one of the nicest old-school bars in the city SERVICE - 4 stars...the bartender takes care to shake and not stir TOTAL - 4 stars...where the elite meet to be discreet",

My friend and I talked to him, but since I was pretty drunky drunk at this point, the details are kinda fuzzy. I think he was in town to do something in Napa, or work on a cookbook, or go to French Laundry, or something like that. He gave me a duck lettuce wrap thing, which for some reason I was convinced was pork. I told him that it was too salty when he asked me if it was good, and then of course I felt very un-swanky for criticizing the food a celebrity chef offered me.

If you have to wait, it hinders the evening.  Getting a coveted bar seat makes you high society. Getting table service and having a waitress all night, even when you move to the bar, that is huge!  The drinks there are strong. I like there Sangria, wine selection, Chocolate Martini, Lemon Drops, just not all in the same evening. Of wait, I did that. Christine was my witness.   If you get there early enough and have a table, you can order from Asia de Cuba, which I like. Don't order a lot from there, there portions are huge! One two appetizers and one main dish for four people is plenty. Spend your money on drinks, not food.  You can meet athletes here, tourists, socialites.... It has a great mix of people.

We arrived around 10pm and went over to a table to find that it was \"reserved\" expecting to be told to hit the road, the hostess came up and was very sweet and polite and explained that it was reserved but took my husband's name and within 5 minutes came back to let us know that she had found us a table and it was in a great people watching location.  It's defintiely trendy and the crowd is a mixed bag, but it's got a great air to it..nice but not snobby.  I was highly impressed with the staff, all very nice.",

I've seen the damning reviews, and would admit it's not a place for every week, but I think you just need to go with the flow, an open mind, and gravitate towards the right folks. Almost every time there (with the possible exception of weekends, when there's a more bridge-and-tunnel crowd) I've had a deliciously lascivious or tactile experience with someone I just met. \u00a0Sorry folks (well, not really), but there some things you just can't resist! \u00a0One attractive, elegant woman who struck up a conversation explained that she lived back and forth between NY during the week and SF on weekends, and when I asked what she did to necessitate such an itinerary, she slowly passed her tongue over her upper lip and replied, \"everything.\" \u00a0Was she working? Probably, but I still enjoyed the sensuously shared sentiment. Another time, a gorgeous woman walked up to me, put her arms around me and asked if I was from Survivor; two minutes later we were locking lips and touching torsos. The best part is, that was 6 months ago and we're still close. \u00a0Jeez, why don't I go there more?? \u00a0I guess I don't want to jinx it, which is probably too late now that I've shared it with John Q Public. But if you're into sensory indulgence, this place delivers! \u00a0Word of caution though, be ready to pay elite prices: I shelled out $14 for a glass of Brazilian rum called Oronoco that the bartender recommended, and which in all fairness turned out to be sumptuous, smooth, and is now my favorite spirit splurge. The haunting wall portraits are trippier than anything I saw in NY bars, and silently evoke an edginess that somehow builds tension and the overall sexy allure.",

I feel as if I've taken the red pill and dropped down a rabbit hole into a disproportionately beautiful world, chock full of sensuality and darkness, mirrored by a lush opulence that just beckons to me. Oversized chairs, indirect lighting, a fireplace that's stretched to the ceiling so reminiscent of Hans Solo's freeze in Star Wars, and this is just the entrance through the Clift into the Redwood Room. I remember the controversy about removing the original wood in the bar when Ian Schrager purchased the hotel and was renovating it. Regardless, the Redwood Room is beautiful. It is eerily dark, with light reflecting off of the mirrored bar and lighted floor to ceiling cabinet holding the wide selection of alcoholic choices that looms behind the bar.   I don't know how to be polite about it, so I won't be. The bar, although it boasts the best Lychee martinis ever (they better be at fifteen bucks a pop, and I need several), and the ambiance is incredible, is always full of poser nouveau riche euro-trash. I really just can't think of another way to say it. Rude rich snobs bumping into my elbow spilling my precious exlixir. Men dressed in expensive suits with no taste or class. Over stuffed silicone breasts so hard I could bouce my lychee right off them and maybe make the shot into the garbage can, or the mouth of an innocent bystander. Sometimes these people ruin my experience at one of my favorite places to go, but because I so admire the decor, love my beverages, and refuse to be run out of \"my\" haunt in my city, I return, time after time. I'm a sado-masochist, a glutton for punishment.   But the creamy deliciousness of my martini so outweighs the elitists surrounding me. And I get lost in the roving eyes of the digital pictures on the wall. As long as I keep to my space and am not bothered, I fall into a dreamlike state there, in the dark, with the light hitting my face usually just the right way from the glowing tables, just so you can see the glint of my eyes and the smile across my face in the dark. The human version of the cheshire cat, hidden in the corner, greedily clasping my martini.",

We valet parked the car and enjoyed some cocktails/apps and dinner in the main dining room. The food was delicious. My friends particularly enjoyed the crab and pate apps. The dark panels and mood lighting offered a nice ambience, but it was difficult to see our menus, so thank goodness one of us had a flashlight app on the iPhone. The pics of Gustav Klimt's artwork, including The Kiss, prompted some interesting conversation. My only complaint about dining here was the parking, which cost $50! I've never paid that much for parking in any other city where I've also been a patron, but I was told it wasn't outrageous for San Francisco. There is a $9 flat-rate parking garage down Geary Street, but \u00a0since it was raining, we decided to valet. The Redwood Room is a landmark and worth a visit. \u00a0They have some oversized furniture in the lobby that served as a fun backdrop for some photos.",

Don't get me wrong - it's a beautiful setting with tall ceilings and what appeared to be wood-paneled walls (haha). \u00a0But it's ridiculously hard to get a drink, and when you do, you're paying tooth and nail for it ($14 for a glass of wine). \u00a0I even had women pushing me to get in front of me to get a drink at the bar, and I don't think that's very lady-like behavior. \u00a0  The bar was very \"scene-y\" and LA-esque. \u00a0The crowd felt older to me than a lot of other SF bars - lots of 40-50 year old men wearing blazers perusing the crowd. \u00a0At the same time, there were young people, too, but we were outnumbered by the tourists and other people there.  I probably won't be back, but it could be a place to grab *a* drink (singular).",

So last Wednesday it was a GAY MARTINI Mixer night at the REDWOOD Room and Bambi had to pull all stops and bust out with an attire to impress the unimpressive and headed here.   I walked right in and spot the \"UBER QUEENS\" all done up in their Versace and D &amp; G \u00a0regal sipping \u00a0on martini's and chatting it up.   And all of a sudden it occurred to me why I don't go here anymore...  1. The Crowd sucks on any given night.   2. It's not as enjoyable anymore (I THINK REDWOOD ROOM IS GOING THUR A BAR BURN OUT).  3. Memories of all the impromptu let's get a room start creeping up.  4. The masturbation incident involving a loud mouth and a drunk dude who had the nerve to pull his pants down at the bar of all places and do his business ( YEAP the cops showed up... the girl screamed rape and there was fluid discovered on the carpet...nasty nasty nasty).  5. A some what famous now infamous ice skater who got drunk and invited me to his room (That is all I am going to say and no one better dare ask me what happened and why the mini bar was empty by check out time).  6. The DJ who forced his tongue in my mouth thinking I was an edible appetizer.  7. The suits and more suits and more suits ( The SF convention bureau must get a kick back).  ... so now I will remember these incidents and think deeply before I ever venture to the REDWOOD ROOM.   The real deal: Drinks are pricey. The food is great but service is lacking. The Crowd is definitely not from this town.",

These bathrooms are divine and rarely used. Big counters, big mirrors, fabulous stalls (and I am a picky one when it comes to my public bathroom usage). These bathrooms alone have saved this little slice o' hell from a one star rating. Otherwise be prepared to spend $20 to stand in a cramped hotel lobby with way too many overdressed people and prepare to spend an additional $17 on say a Sierra Nevada and a vodka tonic.",

There is a really big chair in the lobby that is a popular spot to take photos in, (its in one of my photos if your curious to see what it looks like) and have you ever looked underneath it? \u00a0  Yea I know... who looks UNDER a chair? \u00a0I was down there once trying to look up a friend skirt and *BAM* saw what was under the chair instead...  I won't tell you what is under there, you'll just have to see it for yourself. I will say its pretty cool, but I would have preferred to see up the skirt, my friend said she wasn't wearing panties that night.... Ai yaaa! ;)  The drinks are pricey, but they mix them strong, so its worth it. \u00a0Couple that with the ambiance, and it should totally assist anybody on scoring some play at the end of your date!",

    "review_text": "\"There's still a little space over in the corner there. Its not packed enough, we should let some more people in.\"   So the Clift hotel is pretty posh. The decor is super chic with a \u00a0classy modern vibe. All this translates in the Redwood room.   The Redwood Room is the hotel bar/lounge, outside the dining room. It has a reasonable amount of comfy chairs and couches for enjoying \u00a0cocktails on. Its dubbed the Redwood Room because, you guessed it, its a room lined in redwood. There's a \u00a0large wall shelved from ceiling to floor behind the bar that houses many exotic liquors. Various ghost paintings that gradually move and blink over time also accompany the decor, which I thought was pretty cool. Very Hogwarts esque. It's really just display monitors.   The actual size of the room is quite large. The problem is its fairly narrow, with couches arranged in nonstrategic areas. This does not pose a problem until hundreds of people are ushered in. Thankfully after 20 minutes of waiting for a drink, $8 bottled beer by the way, you can head out into the lobby for some air. If at all possible, avoid going on a weekend night.   So why only one star?   I can understand going to a popular lounge on a Saturday night with no cover in such a fine establishment would attract a large crowd. My problem was mainly with the Clift doorman on the Geary side hotel entrance. Since I had never been to the Redwood Room and the address was the same as the Hotel, I assumed you entered from the front of the building. When we approached the doorman he was unhelpful, and did not direct us promptly to the Taylor St. entrance for the Redwood Room. Instead, he proceeded to tell us lies about how the line for the Redwood Room was extremely long and that it would take 30 minutes of waiting to be let in, but since it was only the two of us, he would let us in the main entrance if we \"took care of him.\" I replied, \"no thanks\" \u00a0I would rather check out the \"line\". As I suspected, there was no line, and we went right up to the bouncer where we were quickly led in.   I'm a bit surprised that such a fine hotel would have such an undignified doorman. But I suppose Greed begets Greed as I've heard the prices here are outlandish.",

He literally could had been anyone on the street trying to steal my vehicle. The Clift should probably work on making them more identifiable. So I just refused to give him my keys, checked into the hotel, then afterwards parked at a different garage near by for a cheaper price. Besides that, I had an excellent experience! The highlight by far was the historic Redwood Room. It was a Friday night and the place was alive....literally. Even the art on the walls were moving to the music and atmosphere. The DJ played excellent electro/hip hop/soul music all night &amp; the bartenders were on point! There did seem to be a couple corporate, pompous, overbearing jerks in the room trying to show off their wealth or pick up on any lady that passed by but they're everywhere nowadays, right?

My first time there was several years ago where a close girlfriend celebrated her birthday and had bottle service. The hostess was definitely pleasant and attentive to our needs! Which i greatly appreciated, considering both my girlfriend (celebrating her bday) and i used to work as bottle service hostess before...she definitely had a decent tip from us, which we understand the importance of their job duties..  Anyway, what i enjoyed about Redwood Room was the fact that there are no barriers or dress code (but of course you should dress with style if you are going to a lounge inside a fancy hotel like the CLIFT. The diversity is great and the music is pretty chill...not extreme hardcore hip hop or super trance/like etc.   (side track) For my birthday several years ago, i had dinner with close friends next door from Redwood Room at Asia De Cuba and the lounge was our meeting spot before we headed to Infusion Lounge to continue celebrating. While waiting for friends to join us before we depart after dinner, Redwoom was very accommodating. \u00a0The cocktails were all unique, and tasty!  Its been a while since i've been back there (considering that Asia De Cuba closed in SF) so i felt i had no reason to go to the Clift Hotel anymore. But overall, i hope the vibe and crowd is still fun and heartwarming, just like old times!",

The Redwood Room, the hotel bar inside the Clift is a San Francisco Institution. I find this place endlessly entertaining.   A cast of characters line the redwood walls....digital pictures hang in large wall frames with eerie eyes that move and follow you around while you drink your Lychee Martini. I can't complain, I have to say, I love it here. I always meet the most interesting people from all over the world here. I also love that most everyone here is 35-55. I think that's what I love most about this place. It's sophisticated and it's OLDER. I prefer it that way. Everyone is well dressed and it's a place you can come and you know what to expect....a cast of characters.   If you ever get hungry here, the mini sliders look good although I've never had them. The french fries at the Clift are amazing! Served with an aioli sauce. I think they are made with truffle oil, because they are THAT good, surprisingly one of the best fries I've had in San Francisco.   Everyone knows that Schrager spent the bulk of his money on the hotel lobby, restaurant (Asia de Cuba), and bar (Redwood Room). The sleeping rooms are sparse. White bedding, mirrors, and cheap IKEA like furniture. It will make you feel like you're in a cheap hotel, but who cares? The party is downstairs, and adventures await you.",

    "review_text": "After a treacherous 5 hours (of trying to get from LAX to SFO) and a sweet flight attendant's suggestion (now aquaintance Jessica who not only offered but actually drove me to my hotel because she lives in the city), we wound up at Clift Hotel's Redwood Room Bar with some local friends.   I read a couple reviews before writing mine - and if I hadn't - I wouldn't have remembered about the line. yes, they do act like it's a club to get into. They make you wait outside and let in one group or party at a time (in 15 min increments) .   Mind you - it was already 12:30am. I didn't see the point but we got in after 15-20 minutes...but maybe that was because we were starvin like marvin and when they heard we wanted to order food also \u00a0- they gave us a table and let us in asap. \u00a0(We were told they have a limited bar menu due to the time )  We got the only things that we possibly could get at that hour.   Food Calamari - the plate was huge but the taste was not  It was chewy and had a lot of batter and was served with KETCHUP in the middle. ummm ok? ketchup with calamari at a hotel? wha?!?!  It also lacked flavor - but we didn't care - we were famished.   Bleu Cheese Burger with Fries (you can pick any cheese you want - so I asked for Gorgonzola - which they said - ok anything but gorgonzola - go figure) The buns for the bread were huge but very dry so we mostly just ate the hamburger patty with cheese. I asked for it to be cooked medium and this place actually cooked it medium and not well - which is usually what happens when I ask for my burger to be cooked to medium. Anyways, then we had...  Some spring roll - which I didn't get the name of because our friend Gene ordered it - but it came with fresh black beans and chopped mango. I think the shredded meat was chicken or pork but I couldn't tell - either way - the shredded meat was SO DRY that I couldn't even finish one roll. Can you believe that? The skin of the roll was light and crispy though.   Okay so as far as the food goes - don't come here for food.   As far as drinks - we got Lychee Martini (my new favorite &amp; the only martini I actually like) Merlot (this is what I drank) Irish Coffee (for the DD) Heineken   The interior of the hotel did remind me of LA's Edison (bar/lounge in downtown) - trendy &amp; swanky - they had couches with candles lit on coffee tables in the lobby area \u00a0and along the way to the restroom (which is VERY BRIGHTLY LIT compared to the dimly candle lit lobby and bar). In the middle of the lobby - there have a gas fire going behind the huge giant chair.   As far as the bar - Steve told me to look up at the portraits or pictures on the wall - they were digital I think? and the portraits actually blinked their eyes or looked to the left and right. It was really cool. Later on, in the night, it changed to some stonehenge pix.   The service was attentive but again - that could be because we were the only ones eating at that hour.   This place is a good place for a date and more for tourists than locals it seems. Not a place to come for singles to mingle or friends, but that's just my opinion.   Also, the only reason I gave this place a 4 is that it was the best nightlife spot we went to on our SF weekend trip. (Note: I have been spoiled by LA's bars &amp; clubs - which I thought I was becoming de-sensitized to until I came to SF and visited the other nightlife spots which pale in comparison. It quickly reminded me that cities outside LA are more urban, old, charming in their own quirky right, and definitely more historic.)   Also a plus is that they did play actual club music at this bar/lounge at a decent volume. (Usually most bars/lounges especially hotel ones at that - you'd expect to hear jazz or downtempo house as light background music)  Posted Photos",

Although when I sat down to order some food and drinks the wait staff was very rude. I don't know if they're are just used to forty year old men being flirty with them or what, but when I pay those kind of prices for descent food and drink, I'm expecting service with it. They did not deliver to say the least.  So if you don't mind paying high prices to be treated badly, then I suggest going here. If not up for the dissapointment, then I would suggest taking your business elsewhere.",

I think the key is to put your name down early to reserve it. We put our names down at 6-7pm, went to dinner, came back around 9-10, and our table was ready.  I got Jameson neat for every drink. It's under poured which is my pet peeve. If I'm paying $12 a drink, then pour me something worthwhile. I finished my drinks in three sips every time.

We came around to the Redwood Room thinking that a swank hotel would have a swank bar. One word: Trendy. That's all it is, TRENDY. The drinks were too much as was a group of gentlemen (otherwise known as \"douchbags\" in this joint) were trying to concocting a story about how their British friend was visiting from Australia (yes British from Australia) and that it would \"totally get chicks.\" Classy joint.  However there is a plethora of empty tables...maybe they're empty because you have to buy bottles in order to stay there. The bar is crowded and the tables are placed around the borders of the room and in the middle so you're kind of standing around with limited mingling room. But it's not like you'd want to mingle, pretentious suits and snobby women who think they're in \"high fashion\" intermixed with the loud and obnoxious frat boys and sorority girls who look like they're waiting for some sort of keg activity to start.   Waitress flirt with the men to get them to buy another overpriced bottle with a bad selection and the hosts are pretentious suits who will undoubtedly \"not catch your name.\"   They take \"reservations\" for tables however my party saw an empty table, sat at it waiting to get kicked out until the host saw that I was with people who could potentially throw down a lot of money. Suddenly there was no wait after the sighting of a few franklins in the wallet. What a magical coincidence!

Amazing mix of people ranging from 21-70yrs. \u00a0Get a table, or stand at the bar, the DJ actually plays you requests. You can get food from ADC if you like and eat it at your table.  Places like this are few and far between. \u00a0  Everyone that complains that should just go somewhere else, Where there are cheaper drinks, crowds packed so tight that it ruins your pedicure and 20 something year old retired frat boys that don't realize they are retired....a few places come to mind, but I won't mention them here.  A word on the line: Walk in the front door by yourself, not with a group, they won't even question you**  **if you are dressed for the season that is. \u00a0If you are rocking a mini in December, you will get sent to the line.",

While the interior is incredibly beautiful, and the cocktails expertly mixed (but way pricey!), it's the people situated within the space that are most fascinating. It's very L.A. like. In fact, it reminds me of some of the tech sector parties I went to here in the Bay Area during the .com boom with the industry power brokers, the venture capitalists, the airheady girlfriends, the supersmart geeks, the wannabes, the paid escorts. \u00a0You get the idea. Essentially the people that \"mattered\" and the people that \"didn't matter\", at least in that fishbowl. \u00a0Same kind of thing going on here. Service is hit or miss depending upon how harried the wait staff is (can't blame them when the place is bursting at the seams with people!). Definitely worth a visit!",

I asked if I could go in and let our friends know we were leaving and he said ok.   My friend then came out after a bit and brought our friend shoes (his hat went in our car) and the bouncer still wouldn't let us in even though she was a hotel guest and got the items from their hotel room. He changed to match their dress code they still wouldn't let him in!  After one minute of trying to talk to him he made our friend cry on her brithday and tried to throw her out. After security came and I made a scene about us leaving if they let her stay he finally said to the security \"take her ass inside, I never want to see it again\".  To say the least - the brief time I was inside it was nice even though the lines to the bar were VERY long, however if you want great service, or at least decent service without racism, go somewhere else!",

It's a very elegant place, harking back to its prohibition-era roots. Everything here is on a grander scale. The Clift hotel fits very well with the old San Francisco style--which brings me to the next point: the martinis.   I have heard that the Redwood Room serves the best martini in SF. In my own humble survey, it does.  I tried the dirty martini and it felt so right! And the Moscow Mule (the drink of the day, served on the rocks) brought me to life! \u00a0  I can't comment on the scene because I was there in the afternoon, but the Redwood Room won my heart for the delicious drinks it serves.",

I've been here on random weekdays and the crowd has been great - a mix of yuppie locals and out-of-towners with the occasional random old guy. The crowd is almost always well-dressed and well-heeled (and you have to be for their prices - probably one of the most expensive bars in town. A grey goose based drink will cost you $14, a patron silver based drink $16. $16 for a margarita?!).  Based on my experiences on Fridays/Saturdays, my advice is to stay away on the weekends, when you have so many better options in the city. Unless your idea of entertainment is to watch 50-somethings get trashed and pick up on 20-somethings (not just 50 year old men hitting on 20 year old girls, I've seen 50 year old women hit on 20-something men as well), in which case you'll get your money's worth.

You can reserve tables here ahead of time so you have a place to sit with your group. Ambience is pretty great, but it gets pretty loud in there. There was a live DJ and live music playing the night we were there (a Thursday evening). It wasn't too crowded around 7-9pm. It was a little hard to have a conversation across the table since the place was so loud.  Fun fact: At one point of the night, the paintings on the walls change into portraits of people and they move! The people will move their head ever so slightly and even blink. Check them out and keep your eyes peeled - don't blink!",

But all BS aside, this has to be one of the most magnificent bar interiors in the entire city. It looks like something out of a hip-hop video: rich, extravagant, borderline decadent. Usually an older crowd, say 40+, but it really depends on the weekend.  Most of the time, this place feels really cliquey. Hard to actually mingle and the music is usually too loud. Bartenders are great, and the bouncers are pretty quick in getting people through the door. But the drinks here are expensive! I understand it's a hotel, and they get lots of tourists, but still...I'd love to make this a \"go-to\" bar but the price and the crowd keeps me out.

I was here a couple Saturdays ago and I honestly didn't think anything bad with this bar until after I encountered a problem with the bartender, who, if I am not mistaken, may have been Mexican. He at first was having an argument about a tab with another customer. That should have already told me not to order from him but I did anyway, not thinking that I may be arguing with him about my tab a few minutes later. I guess there was a misunderstanding that I was paying for another person's drink. Anyway, before handing him my card, he had given me a receipt that charged me for 3 drinks, which is what I ordered. I gave him my card and the receipt that I had to sign reflected a higher amount than what the original receipt had stated. I didn't sign and asked him why he charged me more than what I had ordered. Instead of fixing the problem, he took back the first receipt and added another drink to the tab so that it was equivalent to the amount he had swiped my card for. I was furious about what just happened and asked for the manager. He brushed me off like it wasn't his problem and began arguing with me. He wasn't having it so I spoke to the cocktail waitress and again was brushed off like it wasn't her problem. \u00a0I finally got another bartender's attention and she immediately called the manager without me having to explain the situation. When the manager came out, the original bartender stood there while I explained what happened and the bartender had the audacity to practically call me a liar without saying it to my face. Being a bartender myself, the way the situation played out was just plain shady. I'm sorry but bartenders like that shouldn't be working in that environment especially when you do not know one thing about customer service. It makes me wonder how he got hired in the first place because he was rude and completely unprofessional.

Very clean and polished \"suit\" crowd and the women dress to impress. Obviously, if you come here it is assumed you have some money to throw around.  There is plenty of room, with a large bar and seating available if you get there early enough. \u00a0Although the environment is very comfortable even if you have to stand. \u00a0Can get very crowded though since there seem to always be large groups. I did like the decorations around, the paintings on the walls would almost look alive and would look around and move.

While you're still trying to figure out if you're in the middle of a Weather Girls music video, you may find, as I did, that the drinks are poorly crafted for the price.

Aaah nevermind, if you wait awhile, there's usually a nook you can squeeze into, and it's worth a little wait!",

The lounge is part of the Clift hotel and boasts one of the sleekest designs of any bar in the City, at least that I've seen. Dim lighting, high ceilings, a long bar with towering, back-lit shelves of booze, interesting array of leather and translucent-illuminates sofas, chairs and benches, and these absolutely absurd framed \"portraits\" of random individuals hanging from the wall. Quotation marks necessary because they aren't paintings, but digital films made to look like paintings, and they're basically creepy people giving the camera a dead-on stare for several minutes. Kind of like something out of the Adams Family.   The scotch was good -- no Johnny Walker Red in this place, only Black Label -- and pricey but not out of the range of what I'd expect from a place like this. By far one of the best-dressed, best-looking, moneyed crowds of any bar in the Tendernob. So while I'd definitely go back again, I think it's a little too chic to call it a bar that I'd develop any deep attachments to.",

Even better was not having to pay for them because of all the men falling all over themselves to pay (or should I say, expense).   As for the crowd, it was a total sausage-fest of older men in town on business ready and willing to add a few more drinks to their company's tab. Moderately sleazy, but mostly harmless. The one downside of this place is that you won't meet locals - most of the crowd was from out of town (maybe a good thing?).  The decor here is very sultry - I love the low lighting. I try not to pay attention to the weird digital portraits - frankly they're a bit creepy. I love the chairs in the lobby, and the bathrooms are very nice.  A note to past/present/future patrons: Men - please do not wear your north fleece vest here, and moving your wedding ring to your pinky finger doesn't fool us. And ladies, lets try to be a bit more inventive than the oh-so-boring uniform of your too-tight 'designer' jeans and an ugly shirt that looks like 1998's lingerie. We are not 21 anymore.

Didn't think much else of it other than I wanted to bring my girl back on a special occasion -- it definitely had a warm style. Never had the chance, unfortunately. Instead I wandered in again for a quick drink with a friend who wanted to tell me all about her great new boyfriend. Seemed like a quiet enough spot to hear her story and forget about my own.   We came late on a weekend night and found a table without a problem. Soon I found it hard to concentrate on the conversation as a dozen eyes seemed to be burning a hole right through me, my chair and even the pillar behind me. Intense. This was not what I expected. When I stood up to get another drink (I had already put a lien on my house so I can afford a second round) I had to push and fight my way through a sea of gorgeous European and Asian women. Maybe it was me, but some even seemed to get in my way on purpose so I had to interact with them. One grabbed me. Others have commented on the male:female ratio but I must have been there on a full moon because I had the opposite experience. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go again, though, since I am not into the aggressive \"are you money enough\" or \"just do me\" attitude. I hate fake boobs -- the plastic:real ratio sucks here. It gave me the creeps and would not surprise me if high-roller fraudsters and con artists are in a majority. Would probably come again if I could bring a crowd of my own to enjoy the atmosphere and dilute the childish fantasies and falseness.

Along with being the best cocktails in the city they are also the most expensive for being the most creative, potent and delicious.  If you get there early enough you can secure one of their signature plush red couches with the perfect view to peruse the eclectic crowd of travelers and locals, young and old . . . until the VIP reservations outrank you anytime between 9:30-11PM (but sometimes never) depending on the day and time of year. When it's less crowded you get better service and can enjoy the live, framed artwork on the walls - look for their ever changing faces to tell their story.  You can enjoy amazing Asia de Cuba food late night but prepare yourself for the like-minded prices. A word on tipping your waitress - you are not at a dive bar or even a typical bar, so it's not acceptable to tip her 1$ a drink! These girls work extremely hard with a positive attitude, in very short dresses to serve large areas of demanding customers. Your tip should be AT LEAST 20% if not more.

It's a win win! \u00a0  Hold on to your men, ladies! \u00a0And men, hold on to your wallets-and your wits.   This place can be a little fake, and there can be sharky prostitutes in the lurks.

Like a rabbit appearing out of a top hat that wasn't there moments ago or a skimpily dressed woman being sawed in half and miraculously put back together in one bloodless piece.   Maybe it's the shadowy, sensuous mood lighting. Or the deeply masculine Redwood paneling that makes you feel like you're lounging in the exclusive, invite-only library den of a monied playboy. Possibly, it's the sexually-infused imbibements, ladden with exotic ingredients and heavy parts alcohol.  Nah. I'm pretty sure it's the 5:1 ratio of men to women - with the majority of those XY's being prominent, international business men; investment bankers from Tokyo, sheiks from the United Emirates, shipping moguls from Greece -all with the same carnal thirst for the ephemerally fleeting essence of a San Franciscan female. Is this what a wounded antelope feels like happening upon a pride of ravenous lions? Quiiiiite possibly.  Whatever the reason(s), the magic of the Redwood Room somehow manages to transform homely women into attractive ones, attractive women into beautiful ones, and beautiful women into unattainable supermodels. It should be renamed \"The Upgrade Room.\" As an XX, you'll never know the price of those 4 stiff martinis your slid down your throat, because men are practically fencing each other to buy you a drink, vying to be more to you than just another business card in the girl's bathroom trash can. If you are an aspiring gold-digger, bring your shovel here. Exactly how many indecent proposals have those creepy wall painting eyes been witness to?   As you and your pantheon exit the Room, (because you can only stand feeling like prey for so long) pageant waving good-bye to your adoring male fans, walking in slow motion towards the hotel exit (where did that wind come from? Blowing through your hair in deliberately crafted bursts like a Pantene commercial shoot...), and you exit out into the cold San Francisco night and the citified smell of Geary Street assaults your mortality - just remember to say a silent thank you to Adriana Lima for borrowing her life for an hour.",

The place was packed and the crowd was pretty diverse (in age) - people ranging from mid 20s to mid 60s (I kid you not) but not so much gender diversity with about an 8:1 male to female ratio. I thought the music here was pretty random - but given the vast age difference in their patrons I suppose they tried to play something for everyone.  There's no line, no cover, and no dress code (though people seemed to be on the dressier side here). There are a bunch of tables but reservations are needed. The drinks here are pretty expensive - I'm only willing to pay $15 in Vegas, thank you. Plus, if I'm paying $15 for a drink it better be really good and really strong, sadly, neither were the case here.   Bottom line, I'm not jumping at the chance to return to the Redwood Room as there are plenty of better options in Union Square.",

It's located in the Clift Hotel which is a design hotel by Phillipe Starck, and the quality of the beautiful interiors shows. The lobby and public areas of the hotel are beautiful and the Redwood Room is really the crown jewel. It's a modern take on Art Deco design with redwood walls, beautiful lighting and very comfortable sofas and chairs to sit on while you enjoy your drink(s).   I ordered a simple Grey Goose martini ($15) and it was well-made and service was efficient and friendly. My friend ordered a glass of Chardonnay ($15) and we both really enjoyed sitting there taking in the decor and people-watching. The crowd seemed to be a mix of tourists and business people, but it was still excellent. They also have a nice list of unique cocktails, wines and beers, so you get a good choice when you go - I thought the cocktails made with 20 year old scotch were kind of unnecessary, but I guess it's all about having those options.

The bar at the Clift Hotel, called the Redwood Room, is one of those places. We went there for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers.  There was a hostess for bar seating, which was unusual. (\"How long do you think you need the table?\") But then again, this is no usual bar. My recollection is that the space is about 2000 square feet, with really tall ceilings. Gorgeous redwood coats all the walls and giant LCD screens in frames rotate through artwork (Klimt for example) every 15 minutes or so. Comfy stylish seating arranged in numerous small living-room type areas with small tables lines the perimeter of the room. It was pleasantly uncrowded for the pre-dinner scene, but I'm sure it gets a lot more friendly later on in the evening...  The service was great and the atmosphere cool and hip, but be prepared to pay the price for your hipness. Drinks are $14 but very tasty, and the $45 cheese plate was fantastic.",

You walk in and the inside is gorgeous, architecture-wise, and interior design-wise. Except for the lame-assed LCD art of people's portraits who's eyes follow you wherever you go. Reminded me of the Haunted House ride at Disneyland where the statues eyes follow you. Campy bullshit. This chick I was with was raving about the art before we went in there. I hate her now.  The women in the place are beautiful. I mean hot. Wait, I mean slutty hot. They're beautiful slutty hot.   Here's the catch: They all know it.  The dudes are a bunch of heroes. By heroes I mean guys that get their chests waxed just in case they have to take their shirts off in public for some reason. Or maybe they have an underwear shoot the next day. Who knows. And they have the market cornered on bi-level short cuts with way too much fucking product. And striped button down shirts. There were so many of them in this place it reminded me of the time I was in Vegas in 1999 and I told myself, holy shit. I better get a striped button down shirt, theyre all the rage! Anyhow, it's like Ghost Bar and the Viper Room fucked and had a gaggle of illigitimate kids who's parents forgot to love them enough and they all became Stella swilling assholes and moved to SF.  Getting a beer takes an hour. The bartenders have attitude. Newsflash guys -- you're there for the customer. Not the other way around. PS -- enjoy your big break. See you guys never.   The waitresses, however, are the only redeeming aspect of this place. Fast, courteous, and deserving of a fat tip. Place was packed and I never had to wait too long. And theyre hot. That's nice too.  So to sum up:  Atmosphere - bring some crackers and wine to choke down the cheese with.  Service - bar staff: uppity and slow. waitstaff: hot and fast. yay waitstaff.  Patrons - see atmosphere.",

The bar opens up onto the hotel restaurant dining room, which was either strangely empty or just for special events. \u00a0Lots of little seating areas for quiet conversations before the room gets too loud, two fireplaces and very interesting light fixtures made me feel like I was in an expansive library of an old wood-paneled mansion of an aesthete art collector. \u00a0The bartender was highly amenable to my friend's strange drink requests until we drank them out of Mandarine Napoleon or whatever she was getting.  After 11:00, the crowd really picked up and the place started popping, the dance floor opened up and suddenly we were surrounded by crazy drunk Real Housewives-type golddigger women in the late 30s dressed in fur vests. \u00a0Weird, but fun. \u00a0The faux corporate investment banker menfolk started chatting us up, I left at midnight with two numbers of men I'd met--a first!! \u00a0What!

Everyone is well dressed, music is super loud and a bottle service is available. However, there's no dancing and you're able to sit at he bar even at the peak of the night. It's more of a sit down and have drinks place, though the place can be super crowded and not enough places to seat. \u00a0If you find yourself getting a bottle service, my experience is been just the worst. Once the bottle arrives is very likely you won't ever see your waitress, gratuity is included on all bottle services. So whether you like her service or not she gets a tip.   To enjoy the bar: I recommend going with a small group, getting there around 9:45PM and 10:00PM , grab a seat towards the back and by the bar. You'll still have a great view and the bartender is able to serve you faster. \u00a0This is the place you stop by and pre-party before heading to your last stop.   I wouldn't recommend this place for groups without bottle service and you've been warned by everyone here about the lack of service.   The crowd for the most part is very well dressed, very hot women and this is not your 20-something bar crowd. If you're looking for a PBR or $10 drinks you're in the wrong side of town. The Cliff and The Redwood Room also have a reputation of older gents and younger \"ladies of the night.\" Honestly, probably one of the reasons I go there.

If you want to go drinking at a place that's different - well, this place is different. It looks like Tim Burton's Beetlejuice version of hell. In the lobby of the Clift hotel is a fireplace and a chair that is about ten times the size of a normal chair. Sit down on the couch and you'll find that it's structured by bones. Go to the bathroom and you'll find yourself wandering down a dark corridor until you find the bathroom door. Once you open it you'll be blinded by a white light. Go back out and your eyes will hardly be adjusted enough to the darkness to take you back to your friends.   The bar area has a lot of dark woods. People are staring as you pass by, and that includes the portraits on the walls. Finally find the bar and you'll be charged for really steep drink prices. And when you finally get to sit down and observe, you'll start to find that you aren't really surrounded by San Franciscans anymore.   Personally, I'm fascinated by this place - so fascinated that I've half expected to turn around and find Beetlejuice to be staring at me drooling - instead, I've had close: I've been stalked twice here already (one with a heavy Italian accent and another with a heavy slurring accent). On the other downside, it was hard to get our entire group inside once they started to organize a line outside. We all slowly filtered in within the course of an hour. Since they've put the line outside on the weekends, this place hasn't been the same. But it's still a place that likes to play with your visual senses - drunk or not.",

It's a really nice bar though, def upscale, adjointed to Asia de Cuba restaurant. \u00a0The portraits on the wall have the eyes that follow you, which is definitely a good trip when you're buzzin.   I liked the Gingerberry drink or something...it's $15, but good to try once. Unfortunately I'm a beer drinker and can get 3 beers for that price, so you won't find me here too much.",

There really should be more to say and there really should be more positives but for all the pomp and flair that goes into a night at the Redwood there really isn't much substance there.   The entrance is like that of a red-carpet night at the Oscars. There are lights and limos out front dropping people in fancy Tuxes and dresses off. It is also linked to a hotel so the patrons of the place are also going in and out. There are bouncers and a line at times just to add to the hollywood feel. Once you are inside though things start to feel like there was an amazing frosting on an otherwise normal cake. There decor inside is fun and the huge chair and chaise lounges are great for pictures and looking silly.   Past this area is the actual bar which is actually very upscale. There are a lot of blazers and heels and it seems like the place to bring your sugar momma or make your sugar daddy take you. Either one is fine and you will find both there. The drinks are absurdly priced even for San Francisco. I get paying for an experience and with prices like these you are sure to only be surrounded by people that can afford to spend this type of money on drinks but if that is your idea of fun we likely wouldn't be in the same place anyway.   It is worth going for the experience once but after that I can see no reason to come back here. The drinks are done better and at way better places in places right down the street and once the novelty of the upscale decor and glamour wear off there really isn't much to offer.",

As i stepped inside the lobby, i felt like i'd stepped into a movie set, a movie about over consumption, trophy girlfriends/wives and the effects of cocaine on the inherently obnoxious.  This doesn't mean the bar is without its merits however - the decor is plush, and the staff are very professional and make you feel like a valued customer as opposed to a nuisance like some other establishments i've been to. I was there with a cousin, and three of her more attractive friends, and despite the ample cleavage, legs and shoulders on display, everyone there was really polite, and not a single rude comment or creepy remark mas made to these young ladies. The crowd that night was - albeit somewhat flashy - fairly approachable and friendly. Drinks are a bit pricey however, averaging around $15 - i left my tab open for the group, and tasted vomit after being handed the bill at the end of the night.  With that said, I'll definitely go back, especially when i need to impress a date, an out of town guest or show off my Ukrainian escort for the night.

Gets the feeling that it is crowded easily, tho there's probably only 30 people in the joint.   Out of towners, socialites, fake boobs, greased back hair, MBAs, $11 cocktails, reeks of elitism. in more cosmopolitan burgs, designer places are sometimes populated by designer types; here, you'll find bankers, lawyers, high class ass and foreigners.   And it's time to change the portraiture, guys.  I'm not sure why i've been here so much... (oh right, i'm supposed to be a designer type but i'm really a small minded hater)",

Both totally different experiences. The first, as you can imagine, royalty, totally rockstar treatment, food was phenominal and drinks were amazing. The staff was friendly (if not a little kiss-ass) and attentive. There was not enough protection once we walked in the lobby and out front, transitioning to the street with the pan-handling situation and whatnot but I think that was more our issue than theirs. So for my first experience, I would give the Clift five stars. I have to knock it down a few because the second time I invited a friend to a local spot (I live nearby) and, as a courtesy, we should have been told as we paid $30+ for two drinks that we only had 5-7 minutes to drink them. C'mon...paying that much for drinks, this is not a kegger at a frat house. The lights came on a couple minutes after we ordered our pricey drinks, and a seemingly coked-out bouncer hovered over us yelling it was time to move 'em out like we were cattle. We left our drinks three-quarters full, because we aren't sloths. All in all, I apologized to my friend and was embarrassed that I talked this place up so much. I won't return, or suggest this place, even to my rockstar friends. There's plenty of other smaller, hip and humble places in the area that might not be as grandiose, but won't make you feel like cattle, either.",

Yes, the drinks are pretty pricey, about $15 per cocktail, but are well made and unique. The service is great (from the hostesses and waitresses). They did 'allow' us to sit in the reserved tables until the actual guests arrived. They came back frequently to make sure we were doing OK.  I do agree with the other yelpers, major 'sword fight' (EGON, DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS !), lots of dudes so a great place for ladies night.

Mind you they didn't say it was great.   I happened to be staying in the Clift hotel for my weekend, so I was surprised when I realized this bar was in my hotel lobby. I stopped in here for a drink while waiting for a friend.   It was still pretty early in the evening when I stopped in (about 7:30), however the hostess informed me there was only one place I could sit, as the bar seats were full, and I could only sit there for 30 minutes as there was a reservation for that area at 8. I decided 30 minutes should be fine for one cocktail. However, it took ten minutes for my waitress to stop by and check on me, and ten minutes for my drink to arrive. I can't recall the name of the cocktail I had, but it was one their well known for, a combo of sweet and spicy.   I was rather enjoying it, but my enjoyment was marred by the hostess bustling me out of my chair to a hard plastic bench by the entrance to make space for the 8pm reservation.   Overall the one drink I had was tasty but expensive, and the atmosphere was pretentious.  If you're a young single gal like myself, I'd definitely recommend seeking out other livelier bars",

The bar area was crowded and we had to wait a little while for our overpriced drinks, but the bartenders were fast and the drinks were strong! (Don't say I didn't warn you.)  The crowd is interesting... one guy tried to pick us up by saying he was looking for a trophy wife, and when we didn't respond to that, started going on about his 5 million dollar house. If you are looking for a sugar daddy, clearly this is the place to be.  With that in mind, dress code is definitely upscale but be careful of revealing clothing, as you might be confused for an escort. Apparently that's also a thing here.

For a bar, this might be the most elegant, understated location in San Francisco, and that's saying A LOT.   They had big comfy chairs, everything was really dark, and creepy yet interesting pictures on the wall of people (think Haunted Mansion, where the eyes blink). All that was missing was three or four old guys with Cuban stogies talking about the time they stormed up the hills on foreign adventures.  The restrooms were so clean you could eat off the floors -- no kidding.  The side story: apparently, the wood was from a single redwood tree (believable) that was struck by lightning (believable, only if you are Roy Hobbs), but none the less, the room was amazing.

It's ultra modern, very dark, very sultry, very high end, and well... a cesspool of creeps, tourists, out of towners, business men and yuppies. All stuff that has been said before. In my imagination, the Redwood Room would be the perfect meeting ground for Goths, Morticia Adams, guys in smoking jackets, females in bunny costumes (cute bunny ears and tails... not a full on furry costume no thank you), evening gowns and tuxes, and random strangeness of Alice in Wonderland, Emily the Strange, and Harry Potter all mixed up. The place is sort of a fantasy world except the real life clientele is all all wrong!  I absolutely love the decor, concept, and eclectic pieces of giant chairs and House of Horror art on the wall at the Redwood Room/Clift Hotel. Even going to the bathroom is a feast for the senses (in terms of interior design but if neon lights turn you on then by all means indulge!). The drinks are standard bar drinks with city prices. Nothing special. I take people to the Redwood Room just to see the place. Everything else is not my style.   Get in and get out after a round. Anything else is going to feel like overkill and the people will start to get to you. After being harassed by some dudes, the bouncer at the Clift escorted us to our car. For that, the Redwood Room could not get less than three stars. If not for such safety provided by the Clift, the awkwardness of the crowd could easily make this bar one star par.",

It was Friday at 6:45- perfect time to come here. I was tagging along with a friend to a birthday gathering- the bday peeps had a table so we had a place to sit. Thank jeebus, my lazy ass always needs to sit. ANYWAY. I had a Lavender Lemondrop and also a martini and the nice bartender gave me onions AND blue cheese olives when I asked, like 4 of them!! I was SOO excited.  It doesn't take much to amuse me.  ALSO I was greatly amused by the bathroom- so beautiful and CLEAN oh my I have NEVER seen such a clean bathroom in a public place. It is possible that there is a little elf that resides in the ladies room of the Clift Hotel, existing solely to wipe up every sprinkling of water and piece of stray lint. Or something.  I meandered around for awhile, looking at all of the gorgeous interior design- I especially enjoyed the plethora of interesting chairs.   But! I quickly had to go back to my table, because I heard somewhere that there are hookers in this bar! And I am paranoid that if I am by myself in a hotel bar someone is going to think that I am a hooker! Horreur!   Anyway. I didn't talk to any of the annoying looking businessmen/ tourists- I don't talk to strangers, plus I was paranoid about the whole hooker thing.  I have issues.  SO! Then my dinner date came to pick me up, and as we were trying to catch a cab outside, the driver of the house car for the Clift Hotel offered the car service.   Thanks for the ride to dinner, Clift Hotel!! And the extra olives! Love ya!",

Price: \u00a0whoa! \u00a0high end, for sure  Food: \u00a0four of us ordered a sampling of snacks for dinner. \u00a0Some dishes were unusual and quite tasty (i.e. the rock shrimp), some were surprisingly average (i.e. sliders), and some were WOW (i.e. the flatbread - a mix of prosciutto, shaved cheese, sausage, greens, etc.). \u00a0I can't speak to the drinks because we all ordered the well, cocktail variety and beer.  Overall, I'd guess that the best time to come to this place is on a Thursday night, when I'd imagine it would be a little less busy than a weekend but busy enough to be lively. \u00a0If they have a happy hour, that might help with the cost. \u00a0While the food and service were pretty good, the draw of this place is really the beauty of all that redwood paneling and the overall stylings of the bar. \u00a0Get a corner booth/table if you can so you can watch the room, and avoid the bar's standing traffic.",

A slight drawback is the $15 cocktails. \u00a0Even in SF, that is on the higher side. \u00a0That's kinda OK though, it just means drinking a bit less there.  Other slight drawback is the restrooms are kinda far. \u00a0After multiple cocktails and waters, this can be an issue. \u00a0Sounds like a personal problem though, no?

I guess I was wrong. When we sat down at some free chairs, which was limited that night, the waitress came up to us and said that it was reserved. I told her I didn't see a reserved card. She said, \u00a0\"well you can sit there until they show up, can I get you a drink? At this point I felt like walking out, but when I found out they had Chimay beer, I changed my mind. We had been walking around Union Square all day and I was in need of a refreshing brew, so we ordered up some drinks. Being a hipster comes at a price and the drinks were mighty pricey.  I have to say, I really like the design of the Redwood Room, the backlite bar was impressive, as were the large chairs at the entrance of the bar. The crowd that night seemed to be a collage of financial district types and tourists who were in the mood to strut.   The Redwood Room is worth checking out and having one drink, but that is about it.",

The crowd is very eclectic...people trying to be seen, young professionals, ladies trying to get their sugar daddy on...etc.  Drinks are tasty, but be prepared to drop a hefty dime.  Music is great - the DJ spinning on the night we went was off the hook! As many others have mentioned, no room to dance, so prepare to shake your thang where you can!  Crowded is an understatement. Couches and tables are reserved for bottle service, so unless you're reserving a table, chances are you're going to be standing all night.  Great place to come and enjoy the atmosphere and people watch!",

It's an atmosphere, an ambiance. The staff is great. The people-watching was very much fun for me, as I think pretentious crowds are pretty hilarious, and for someone like my friend, who wants to surround herself with pretentious designer-clad women and their sugar daddies.  At one point, I actually heard a woman behind me say: \"I just put down $700 on these shoes...how can I think a $17 cocktail is pushing it?\"  The Redwood Room kind of makes you feel like a celebrity.

They're made by a nice Asian lady (the night I went) who smiles and pours liquid from different bottles (that she probably doesn't know anything about other than the name) in a glass. It's pretty much some Asian auntie who is \"throwing something together\" when people come over. It's not a sophisticated liquor-educated person in a suit/bow tie sharing with you their thoughts about libations who is using some special bartending technique they've perfected. The Asian lady will ask questions like, \"do you like something sweeter or less sweet?\" then make some random suggestion that has some fruity mixer and serve it to you as if she is the greatest mixologist. She is thinking about how much of a sucker you are spending that much on one drink. Somewhere a $16 cocktail is worthwhile, a bartender will ask questions such as, does your palette enjoy smoky, bitter, fruit flavors?  I mean, it's mostly foreigners walking around this bar probably on a all-expenses-paid business trip, so whatever. With that said, this is not the place you want to go for cocktails unless you're in your 40's/50's and have money to blow without children to take care of. You won't wonder why this place has only 3 stars. I think this is one of those times where the owner might see all the poor reviews and just be like, \"whatever, we're in a good central downtown location and lots of random people will always come and empty their wallets at this subpar quality bar.\" I wonder how many people actually come back to this bar after the first time.  To end on a positive note, the furniture and \"moving paintings\" on the wall are pretty cool--like you're at Hogwarts. They're obviously flat screen TV's.",

And good luck finding a place to sit; unless you're too cool for school and would actually reserve the VIP. section just because you can, the staff - bartenders included - won't bother with you unless you're into bottle service. Because I'm not into paying S.F.O. prices for my top-shelf drink selections, I won't be going back.  The only reason I'm not lowering my rating is because the beautiful, deep wood of the almost-clandestine interior nearly compensates for the lack of thoughtfulness elsewhere; and what an impressive bar area, the entrancing light of glass against the darkness and intimidating height of the walls surrounding it create such an interesting juxtaposition, it's like being in an ice scene inside of a shaded forest. My suggestion for anyone curious about the Redwood Room: drink before you go, stop in before the crowd gets jumpin', and head to a smaller space once you're over the schmooze fest and real (but probably not) affluence.",

I'll start with the good: The place has a cool, upscale decor (mood lighting, portraits on the wall that have moving eyes) and the cocktail menu is infused with some original ideas.   I'm knocking off 1 star for the drinks and 2 stars for the service.   Before going, I'd looked up the place I did expect that the drinks would be expensive since it had 3 dollar signs, but at $19 a pop with the included gratuity I expect to have a cocktail that knocks my socks off. Don't get me wrong, the cocktail I had was good but not astounding. Further, a couple of friends in our group did get cocktails that ended up being almost undrinkable and the bartenders were not as accommodating as they could have been to fix the drinks.   The cashiers/hostesses (not sure what to call them since they weren't making drinks nor did they greet us when we entered) were simply awful. They had bad attitudes AND were borderline incompetent. They made paying for our group a nightmare. As is usually the case we were asked to keep a card for the tab.   We asked if we could just pay separately at the end instead of putting down 5 cards and were told it would not be a problem. We had made it clear that the card was intended to be used for the few friends who ordered drinks together but the staff ended up holding it for the 20+ people who were there for the same birthday. When we tried to pay for our drinks separately, we were told we would only be able to do so if we paid with cash. Let me make it clear that I do not expect that I have to pay with cash in a swanky place. After an aggravating 20 mins we were finally able to cut our losses by getting them to just put the 5 drinks we initially ordered on the one card we original put down for the tab.",

I have no idea what the rooms are like, but if you want a shi-shi type place, you will have fun people watching here. It is close to a lot of dive bars since it is near the Tenderloin (which is the pooest part of town with lots of homeless people - but trust me - there are homelss people everywhere in SF, they don't bite.) One of my favorite bars is down the street. You are still close to Union Square, shopping and all the theatres.",

    "review_text": "I managed to score a sweet deal at the hotel this bar is located at, so I figured I might as well check out the bar while I was there. \u00a0I scoped out some yelp reviews an hour beforehand to get a feel of what to expect, and from reading a fair amount of reviews, they were pretty much spot on.  It was moderately early (~10:30PM) on a Thursday night, and the bar was PACKED. \u00a0Packed, as in I could feel the sheer heat emanating from the number of bodies in the room. \u00a0All the tables were full, and there were a large number of people in front of the bar.  The crowd was definitely older -mid to late 30's. \u00a0People were dressed to impress, and cougars were a plenty. \u00a0There were definitely some extremely good looking women, and for every one of them there were at least 2 - 3 average looking men in attendance. \u00a0I can't say for sure that there were any working girls there, but it wouldn't surprise me.  Despite the crowd, I managed to get the attention of the bartender relatively fast. \u00a0I ordered a double whiskey (top shelf) and double tequila (also top shelf). \u00a0The damage? \u00a0$60 + tip for 4 shots of alcohol. \u00a0Damn, but I expected that.  Later on that evening I ordered a Pisco Sour (made to the best of their ability) and bailey's on the rocks, and the cost was significantly lesss ($24 + tip).  The bar lives up to it's name in decor. \u00a0The room is (apparantly) constructed of huge redwood walls with an impressive bar display. \u00a0If you are fortunate enough to find a table, the chairs are comfortable enough. \u00a0We managed to secure some \u00a0chairs in the adjacent lounge, and it was quiet enough to talk there.  Overall, the price was a bit too high for what they had to offer, but it wasn't really my scene either. \u00a0Perhaps if I was single, a bit older, and had some cash burning a hole in my pocket. \u00a0A dash of desparation couldn't hurt either.  3 stars because it was a decent bar, just not for me.",

My desire to sit on the big chair in the lobby designed clearly with the Bamyan Buddha or Ozymandias in mind is almost palpable. I cannot find any reason to do so.  The pictures on the walls stare at us, and suddenly I realize one of them just blinked. I haven't had a drink yet, so I surmise this must be the result of walking down a hill after a meal - or a fevered imagination. Whichever. When another portrait repeats the performance, I know I am in a magical place.  The crowd is older - more successful (or hard core boozer) types, sizing up the women on display. Most of the ladies are texting while they flirt, an impressive performance. Some hopeful has cornered a large sofa and is trying desperately to get the uninterested woman he is sharing the couch with to give him her number. I decide that he has had enough opportunity, and we are too many to stand around. Requesting spare chairs from other twosie threesie patrons, we proceed to make them uncomfortable. Soon enough they leave - not before my friend ends up sharing the couch with the amorous and the uninterested.  Drinks are a steady $10, which is rarely impressive. But the bottles on absinthe on the highest shelves? Yeah, those are impressive. I miss the Vltava at night.  Can't give it a four, doesn't deserve a three. More like a 3-1/2.",

With that dilemma, the bar is packed and there is never any sitting room there either.   Drinks are ridiculously expensive, $16 for a shot of Don Julio and $8 for a Corona, so definitely not for the faint of heart or pocket.
