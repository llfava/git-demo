So Fly Bar has terrific sangria and it comes in pitchers for only $20. \u00a0The lighting is great. \u00a0It seems to be busiest in the early evenings and tapers off post-dinner. \u00a0I don't come to the Divis \u00a0Corridor often, but Fly Bar is my go to spot for a drink.",

The bouncer greeted us warmly. The ambience is vaguely upscale, appropriate for NOPA, but before anyone cries \"Begone yuppies!\" know that there is a pool table in the back. The place was cracking at midnight on a Saturday night. We grabbed the last free table--near the window, directly under a loudspeaker. The hip-hop soundtrack made conversation challenging, but on the other hand I was glad to learn the source of the sample on Massive Attack's \"Five Man Army\" (\"I'm Glad You're Mine\" by Al Green, if you're keeping score).   Drinks are priced reasonably: $4 for Stella, $4-$5 for the house specialties, soju cocktails. I find the fuss about soju in earlier reviews curious, because you can't taste a hint of the spirit in them. (Maybe that's the issue for those looking to get f'd up.)  In case you're wondering, the date finished well--which I discovered only after the fact. After driving her back to her place and saying good night, I received a text message. \"Drive safely. Too bad you didn't make a move when you dropped me off.\"",

Overall I have a hard time swaying from pizza, but they do have other very good food options.  They have a pool table that is slightly awkward because you can't fit a normal size pool stick with the wall, so they have a mini stick you can utilize.

Parking can be tough, but there is a public garage about a block away. It's not a huge place, but it's spacious enough to accommodate large groups. We had a table for 8 right next to the pool table.  The majority of the crowd were white males in their late 20's to mid 30's. I was constantly bumping into people to and from the only restroom, but the crowd was cool and easygoing.   I was pleased to see that this bar also serves food! We ordered about five pizzas, artichoke and spinach dip, baked brie and nachos. I love the crust on their pizzas. We tried the Meat pizza which was the best one compared to the Margherita and Funky Chicken. I really enjoyed their baked brie with bread; warm, rich, creamy, cheesy goodness! We also ordered a couple pitchers of sangria which was also good.  What WOW'd me the most was the fact that they frikkin played Gangstarr! Not just one song, but a few! They played a lot of hip hop which I didn't expect to hear based on the employees and the crowd. The servers acted like they didn't want to be there half of the time, and they also screwed up our order, but they were also extremely busy with only two servers.   Overall, I had a great time. Fly atmosphere. Fly vibes. Fly food. Fly drinks. Fly music. Fly bar.",

There's a pool table in the back, but according to the pool mavens, the space is too cramped to be acceptable.

Got one of the tables in front of the bar, can be cramped for a party of four and people sitting next to you. Front door has a habit of not staying open and not shutting completely so on a cold night, sit far away.  Love the interior, dimly lit with dark red interior. Could be color blind? Fun shuffle board in the back and the wait staff is very friendly. Cannot say the same for the bar, as I never ordered a drink there.  Score places high on my list as they had Speak Easy on tap, two kinds. Everyone seemed to love the Sake drinks, which were some incredible mixtures of stuff I would not drink, not when even paired with alchol, like SOY MILK! But they really did pull it off when I sampled all their crazily named Sake drinks with even more interesting ingredients.   I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, to many times have I been to bars and lounges expecting microwave quality food. \u00a0Food was great, thin crust pizzas with an assortment of great toppings and the chips and guacamole were better than some restaurants.

Because the service and beverages were good I give Fly Bar an OK.   Although, I got FOOD POISONING from the nachos, because of the great reviews from Yelp I'm assuming it was a freak of nature and something out of the norm for this place. However, what I was most irritated with was when I called the following day (practically on my death bed) to give them heads up to check their food, the weekend manager didn't seem interested, and asked if I had the flu instead. I think we all know the difference between a flu and food poisoning without going into details. He never asked my name or number and only brushed me off with an apology already tarnished by doubt. Not cool buddy. I was reluctant on Yelping about this, but because of the nonchalant attitude of the severity of this issue, I assume they wouldn't care if I did so.",

People who complain about soju cocktails know little about the industry, or really the city, because Type 48 licenses are hard to come by and there are reasons why they're fewer and farther between in certain neighborhoods but if anyone besides me cared about the historical underpinnings of human phenomena, I'd have more friends and we damn sure wouldn't be in Iraq. Fuck this world. Let's go have a (soju) cocktail.   I like Fly. I loved it as a USF student, because back in the day before the massive ABC crackdown on selling to minors (punish the kid with the fake ID, not the bar!!!) Fly was the spot for a midday snack, a refreshing sangria and a friendly game of pool. And the value of the midday snack goes underappreciated. A wise woman once said, \"why can't you get a sit-down meal between 3pm and 5pm anywhere?\" Indeed. Well, at Fly, which used to be a pizza place so there's a bonus kitchen in the bar, you can get a variety of tasty snacks at many off-peak times, usually served by a no-nonsense tattooed hottie of either gender. That's big value, in any neighborhood.   You want to look down upon Fly because you're a 94117 culture whore (or an ignorant slut who just \"discovered\" this amazing neighborhood called \"NOPA\"), but the reality is, if you stumbled upon a place like this in a less sophisticated neighborhood (and if you were here back then, you know that this used to be a much less sophisticated neighborhood) you would be stoked.",

Happy hour is from Noon-6:30 and offers discounted prices on Beer, Sangria, Sake Cocktails and Pizza!   Although the bar doesn't serve any hard liquors, bartenders will mix up tasty and tropical cocktails made from all sorts of Sake. They also offer a ton of beers on tap ranging from Paulaner Hefewiezen to Guinness as well as bottled beer. Wine and Sangria are also served by the glass, and if you had a really hard day pitchers of sangria are there to save the day.   The food menu is composed of a basic list of appetizers, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. My personal favorites are the Nachos and the Greek Pizza. Don't forget that all pizza's are half-off during happy hour.   All in all the bar is the perfect place to go to for a low key night during the week with one or two other people to shoot some pool or a wild weekend night full of sake bombs and loud music.",

Even with a family history of heart disease and using pliers to zip your pants, I've been watching what I eat and exercising, which is slllooowwwlly helping me slim down to the trophy hottie that the Boy deserves.  We were looking for some appetizers to split for dinner that weren't too fried and wouldn't stick on my butt like the hand of a guy eager to escape his stale marriage. \u00a0Already in the neighborhood, I suggested we pop in here and give their chow a shot. \u00a0Not bad, Fly Bar.  We split the quesadilla and some goat cheese/bread. \u00a0Both dishes were very tasty. \u00a0As planned, I nibbled like a supermodel, but decided not to purge afterwards because I don't do that anymore.  I recommend Fly Bar for a quiet place to enjoy the company of your sweetheart and share some tasty morsels in a cozy setting. \u00a0Our server was pleasant, and our experience was a solid 3 Stars.  I think I'm already looking like one of the V.Secret Angels - okay, Heidi Klum when she was 8 months pregnant, but we're getting closer here.",

I tried 3 different cocktails - Japanese Chiwawa, the pear one and one surprise one that the waitress brought. They were good! Although, admittedly, not that strong. No problem, couple glasses of Stella later I was allllllll good!  The pizzas we ordered were Shroom Pie, Mmm..Meat, Jimmy Greek, the chicken one and the pineapple one. By far our favorites were Shroom Pie and Mmm...Meat!! I think that those two have the most creative fun to say names as well =).  Also, the good thing is if you get to comfortable and end up staying past happy hour (4:30-6:30) beers are only $4 as opposed to the $3 happy hour price and it gives you an excuse to try the rest of the menu as well!

This is a massive glass though, especially considering the price.   Service is great - friendly but not over the top - but not always super fast. I kinda like taking my time though. Chill vibe which is always appreciated.  Carmel blue pizza for $4.50 (half off during happy hour) is tasty. I probably wouldn't get it at the normal $9, but it's always nice to have cheap noshing options. The caramelized onions were delish, and I'm always a sucker for gorgonzola.

As someone who has been a server many years of her life, I know a tip is a PRIVILEGE, not a RIGHT. \u00a0We declined to tip this waitress (something I haven't done in 7 years) for her hostile, inappropriate attitude, after which, she chased us down the front sidewalk demanding something be left for her. \u00a0She had zero class, zero dignity, and no clue. \u00a0I'd be embarrased for myself if I was stiffed and would never make an ass out of myself trying to chase down an unearned tip!! \u00a0I'd try it again if I could be reassured this person was no longer an employee, but til then...

The people that come here are diverse and just chill people with an edge (far from my Marina home) and the vibe is a very open one.   The sangria here is yum - one of the things they are known for - and usually my drink of choice here. Great and fun background music where you may leave suddenly feeling like you want to go off and dance. I heard they have good happy hour so I need to try that very soon.

    "review_text": "Although I am definitely not a hipster (mental note: the first sign of being a hipster is denying that you are one), I must admit that I do tend to avoid the kinds of bars that Robert Lanham lists in his priceless expose of hipsteria (\"The Hipster'ss Handbook\", 2002). \u00a0Let me quote the pearls of wisdom that you will find on page 35.  Hipsters despise these kinds of bars:  -Sports Bar (those attended by \"jocks who wear numbered jerseys or white baseball caps\")  -Bars with Dartboards (because \"they tend to attract the same crowds found at sports bars\")  - Bars with Blended Drinks (because \"these bars draw in boys who like Jimmy Buffett and the type of women one sees on E! channel\")  - Cigar Bars (because \"they are frequented by creepy CEOs and Wall Street types who shred questionable accounting documents and cheat on their wives with hookers\")  - High Profile Bars and Clubs (because \"bars with beefy bouncers and stretch limos parked outside are midtown. They attract the fashion-deprived elite and are almost always tourist traps for the hipster wanna-bes, guys with ponytails, and tassels with flubber\")  Now, I would add to this list that generic bars with television hanged on the wall - and usually tuned to some sport event - should also be banned for life. Pubs too are evil. too. I mean, they serve beer and greasy fries! How dare they?  And yet, occasionally it's refreshing to see that there's life beyond the wine bar ghetto. Amelie is addictive, but an overdose of Bordeaux is to be avoided. At all costs.  The good news is that among the bars that you'll find on that fascinating street that is Divisadero - so charismatic that celebrated author Michael Ondaatje used for the title of a novel (which I have not read, therefore I am fully entitled to mention and even recommend) - Fly Bar is the king of the hill.   Yes, there is a television set perpetually tuned to some boring sport event above the entrance (sigh).   And yes, it features not one, not two, but three pool tables, another cardinal sin because pool tables are magnets that attract \"jocks who wear numbered jerseys or white baseball caps\".  But still, bear with me.  Fly Bar makes outstanding soujou and sake drinks.  The fact that these drinks are affordable is a bonus, especially in harsh economic times like these when even shopping at entry-level drugstores like Whole Foods can become a nuisance.   I would recommend Soujou Nectar (soujou and Pineapple Juice). (tip: all considerate men should drink pineapple juice on a date. Trust me on that).   Fly Bar is conveniently located a block away from club formerly known as Justice League, aka The Independent, making it the perfect spot for a pre-concert \u00a0refill.   Happy hour is every hour. The staff is generally good but changes constantly (quality of service varies from really good to really bad - which makes a visit always exciting - \"What's gonna be this time? \"Will I fight with the bartender? Will I fall in love with the waitress?\" suspense! suspense!).  Hence the four stars.  Without the TV set and the pool tables, I would crank it up to six.",

We walked right up to a table at 7:30, it was full but not terribly crowded.   Food - Very basic stuff - pizza, salads, and sandwiches. Everything was tasty, though nothing was out of this world fantastic. We ordered a BBQ chicken and a Hawaiian pizza (though they both had different names) and a spinach/artichoke appetizer. It was enough for three.   Drinks - Good beer menu, full bar, and excellent (Americanized) sangria. We split a generously sized pitcher and it was enough for us all.   Value - We each walked out for under $20 having ordered an appetizer, two pizzas, and a pitcher of sangria. You really can't beat that - and we came after Happy Hour.

It's a small place that doesn't seat many people, but I was there for an engagement party, so we took up half of the tables in the location.   We got to sample the pizzas, which were really nice; they looked and tasted a lot like CPK-style pizza, which is fine by me. I was starving, so I also ordered the Foghorn Leghorn sandwich. It was soooo good! The Foghorn Leghorn has chicken, bacon, guac, and other delicious things that came on delicious bread. To drink, I had a sake madras (oj &amp; cran). It was pretty tasty.   The crowd was somewhat mixed in age, gender, and hipster status. The music was really great. It seemed to mostly consist of good quality, less-than-mainstream 90s and 00s hip-hop.

Nothing even happened there.\"  Oh, sweet, sweet, simple man... You are so wrong. Not only am I going to write a review of the Fly Bar, I'm going to dedicate my 200TH REVIEW to it. And here goes...  I've never liked the Fly Bar. Hence why I was totally zoned out on my most recent visit. For some reason, people think entering it makes them \"fly\" and there are always stupid girls bumping and grinding around the bar like the fly girls, only they are NOT as fabulous as J. Lo and their booties are NOT as scrumptious.   There's a two-inch step up to the tables immediately to the right of the door, which has caused me to almost fall on my ass WHILE SOBER so many times in that bar... There's just NO REASON FOR THE STEP TO EXIST. No reason. And NO REASON I need to fall down while sober. I mean, I've faceplanted PLENTY of times in this city. But I PREFER to have a good excuse:  -- My big angry Irish friend and I were celebrating Christmas with a vodka-drinking contest at Murio's Trophy Room (we are classy shit!).  -- It was my roommate's 30th birthday and I HAD to out-drink her. And the doorman. And all the metal dudes hitting on us. At Annie's Social Club.  Etc, etc.   I can recover from such spills just fine. Sober spills -- fxxx that. NOT fly.  Weekend nights here are crowded and service is slow. Also not fly. In general, this is just another bar that's not made for me. Which is fine. I am who I am. I'm a lush, I like cheap booze, chill crowds, good music (meaning the music that I LIKE -- duh), unpretentious people and unpretentious surroundings. I like things the way they are where I come from -- Detroit. The Fly Bar doesn't fit that bill, and that's okay. For the most part, I just avoid it and places like it and everyone stays happy.  But I was there last weekend. The company I was with likes it, and I'm not that big of a brat, okay?  (Even though Waziema is right down the street! Right down the street!)  And I've decided, for my 200th review, that I'm going to give it three stars instead of two. Because had I not gone there on Friday night, I wouldn't have seen, as I was approaching, Starla D. and amir a. standing outside smoking cigarettes. And I wouldn't have been forced to make nice with Amir after a little tiff we had.   Briefly, it went something like this...  Amir and I were going to mock meat restaurants to eat about once a week for a while there trying a different one as often as possible and we really wanted to try Layonna Vege on Clement but the time we tried it was closed and then the next time he asked me to go I said I couldn't because it was the night before I was moving (hello!) and then I find out the next week via this yelp review -- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/WDHpY_FcUAJjUm-YQW2xrw#hrid:xa089lzcfcZFsGrgs5ebww\">yelp.com/biz/WDHpY_FcUAJ\u2026</a> -- that he had gone there with other people and I was hurt okay? and I sent him a compliment that basically said \"fxxx you our ritual is DONE\" because come on! you guys couldn't have gone to a different restaurant? you couldn't have waited until AFTER I was settled or something? sheesh but oh well and I really wasn't THAT mad but I just wanted him to know that I was really enjoying our little ritual because I love Amir and I was a little bummed about that and then I don't hear from him for like THREE WEEKS I mean I even got an ROTD and he didn't even compliment me WTF? THESE THINGS MATTER! so I email him \"amir you can't be mad at me because I said I was mad at you that's lame come on let's just get over this speak to me damnit\" or something like that and he just emailed me back \"what are you wearing\" WTF? so I email him back \"jeans a tank top and a bandage on my new tattoo sexy shit\" or something and then another week goes by no word from \u00a0him and I email him again \"SERIOUSLY are you never going to speak to me again?\" and he emails me back \"what are you talking about! I asked you what you were wearing!\" or something and then I see him at my roommate's birthday at Inner Mission Tavern and he looks all depressy and I don't talk to him because I think things are still weird and then the next time I see him is at Fly Bar and Starla is like \"you guys talk! please!\" and we do and Amir \u00a0is like \"I was afraid of you!\" or something and I'm like \"WTF! this is so dumb! I love you! can we just be friends now! AND WHY ARE YOU SMOKING YOU SHOULD QUIT BECAUSE I'M QUITTING AND QUITTING SUCKS AND MISERY LOVES COMPANY!\"  And all this was relived/resolved/happened outside the Fly Bar. And the bouncer was very entertained by our drama. He seemed like a cool dude.  Extra star, The End.",

We went on a Wednesday night just before happy hour was over and ordered nachos and beer. We arrived to a full house and luckily got 2 of the last seats at the bar because a couple people had just left. Staff was super attentive and made sure we had menus and drinks asap. Served with smiles all around and several people checked in to make sure we were doing ok. A+ guys!  Our nachos seemed to take longer than normal at most places, and the chicken was buried at the bottom of the plate. At first we thought we got the wrong order because we could even see any chicken on the plate. They were tasty for sure, but I'm a fan of nachos with all the fixings mixed up so I can have some on every chip!  We had several beers on tap and were lucky enough to catch the Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, a local favorite! We also partook in the sangria - thanks Kristina - and it was excellent!

The crowd used to be more your fun locals, but now, though I still pop in about once every couple weeks for a beer and a bite, the scene has totally changed as they tried to make it swankier, the people are those boring cookie-cutter types who troll in from the Marina, from bridges, through tunnels, out of outer Sunset manholes. The kind of people who remind you of the people you were trying to never see again when you chose to move to San Francisco, (unless you were born here making you the only one ever). Guys who say bro, have matching colored shoes and shoelaces, tuck their t-shirts in, and probably tell girls they're 'producers,' cuz they recorded their friend's shitty hip-hop record on ProTools. Girls in slightly sideways baseball caps, probably own a small useless dogs, mouth the words to horseshit like Jay-Z and think they're slumming it at the Fly Bar. It's too bad, because Russ is a great bartender, the food is killer, the beer is great, but I just don't really want to spend my money with a bunch of assholes!!",

So I went climbing at Planet Granite in Belmont, then out for a bite and a beer with a friend. I looked at my watch and thought, if I leave now I can make it home in time to pop into a new bar in the 'hood. Finished the beer, said my good byes and rolled hard.  1am....unload the car, pop out the door and down the street to the Fly Bar. I'm a regular at the Page, but like I said, I was feeling adventurous, plus I wanted a new place to Yelp about.  Fly Bar is a cool spot. It was pretty low key when I rolled in. I kinda expected it to be a bit more lively on a Thursday. Any who, I like the look of the place, the bartender was way down to earth and I felt totally relaxed in there.   No hard booze, but a good selection of beer and Sake. I had a local SF beer, Speakeasy Prohibition Ale, which is actually my new default beer. I've never been into the soju cocktail thing, but then again I've never tried them much. So since it's local I may give it a whirl. I also noticed they have sangria...which I'm a total sucker for even though it's sweet....my excuse, it's the Latin blood. Sangria calls to me.   I'll be back, maybe I'll pop in there tonite as it's close and I'm gotta turn in early for a.....you guessed it...a big bike ride. Damn it, I thought i was gonna do one review without talking about a bike ride....oh well everybody's got their vices ;-)",

I still go here every few weeks for a happy hour pizza and a few beers.   I've had many many nights here over the years in numerous states of intoxication, used it as a first date spot a couple of times, was politely asked to leave one night and have been graciously allowed back in with no questions asked since.

We had no idea how much food we ordered, or how little, but there was no way we could order more later anyway.  Nevertheless, food is yummy. pizza is really delicious.

I recently went on a Sat night; it was pretty crowded, but not elbow-to-elbow proximity and my friend and I snagged stools at the bar right away. The bartender was an interesting fellow and gave us his attention pretty soon. I have to agree the array of cocktail selection was dizzying. I ended up picking the Mangorita, a soju cocktail with mango, lime, cranberry, and some other fruity combination. Man it was really good and refreshing. And it was only $5! Excellent deal.   Unfortunately I was close to maxing out my drink limit prior to coming so I couldn't finish my Mangorita. Plus the bartender was screaming \"last call\" at the top of his lungs at 1:24 am, and continued to do so every 5 minutes after that to get people to finish their drinks, close tabs, and get the hell out. He did it in a playful manner, of course. Otherwise I'd be like, \"dude, chill out, I still got till 2 am to finish this fabulous cocktail.\" If I lived or worked closer to Fly I would come more often and try the happy hour specials yelpers have been raving about. This place could also be great for an Independent pre-concert drink. \u00a0But if you're just looking for a good neighborhood bar with good drinks, decent service, and interesting people, Fly's your place.",

Come during happy hour and it is only $5. Dare I say that though it is a totally different style of pizza, it is just about as good as Nizario's. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  Drinks:  Good beers on tap and I like that they only serve sake, a good change of pace.  The people: Everyone is chill. Mixed crowd. Not really a college scene. A good place to go with a small group of friends. Not too big cause tables can be hard to get.   The service: I have had everything from awesome to ok. Even when things are just ok, I can't complain. It's usually cause they are busy, and hey, just cause everyone wants another beer or some good food, you can't get mad at the waitress (look at me making excuses for mediocre service when I am usually the first to get mad).",

Gill had warned us that the restaurants and bars would be packed and that seating would be a premium. And she was right.  I arrived first and walked up and down the street bouncing between Madrone and Fly Bar looking to secure a table. But it was my wife who showed up late who was able to snag a nice table with a street view for us.  Fly Bar offers beer, wine and soju only. They do have Duvel which is my favorite Belgian Ale of the moment. To the person who I saw drinking a Pabst at Madrone. Your beer is trendy, but it sucks. Do yourself a favor and drink a good beer. Anyway, enough with my rant. Fly Bar also offers a better than average bar food bites. Pizza, sandwiches, chicken thingies, salads etc. We were a hungry group and sampled a few of these. I had the margherita pizza which I found to be delightful, thin crust with a healthy topping of cheese, tomatoes and basil. My wife went with the hummus appetizer which I did sneak a taste of and loved. Gill and Ting split a spinach dip app that looked of top quality as well.  The bar is crowded and if you aren't careful you may find a strangers elbow resting in your face. But despite all the craziness, the service is good and the servers very friendly. \u00a0A nice venue for good conversation.  PS. Where was Alexandra?",

They are good, don't get me wrong, but nothing beats that crisp yumminess that is a vodka martini and if you are looking for that, don't come here.  As the other reviews explain, this is a beer and soju bar for the most part. I didn't realize that when i walked in with a group of friends and was handed what looked like a Cosmo. It was a pink ginger something or other and while good, it just wasn't what I was expecting or wanting.  Besides all of that though, this place is great! It's totally cute inside and still has a bit of a divey feel, but kicked up a few notches. The lighting is neat, the art is neat, the people are neat and whether you are here at night or in the afternoon, it's a great space to hang with friends and enjoy a good time.

I usually go later at night, but as other people have mentioned, they have a good happy hour, so hit it up sometime if you can.",

Location: Good... I mean what else is there to say? Easy to get to, lots of bars and food around... so yea, location is good.  Drinks: While they don't have a full bar, the drinks are still yummy! I recommend the Mangorita or the Nigori Punch. Also, the Sake Bombs are the best!!! They make them with cider so they taste like candy (very good, but very dangerous)!  Food: Excellent! It's a BAR... but Fly has a great menu, and they serve late! My picks are the Humus and Tapenade Plate, or the Goat Cheese Chicken Quesadilla.  Clientele: Chill, it's pretty mellow in there during the week. It's pretty much locals. What's great about this is the staff gets to know you =) On the weekends it can get a little more crazy, but if you get there before 9pm you can usually get a table.

Yesterday happened to be one of THOSE days where everything compounded to the point I resorted to something I rarely do; use FB as a venting mechanism only to look like a total attention whore. BAD IDEA. People, this is why health insurance covers \"mental health\". USE IT.   Perturbed over something that went awry, I was up all night tossing and turning all night only to then oversleep. The endorphins from my morning cardio session was temporary as I got into an argument with my melodramatic friend over something very arbitrary. This followed with finding duplicate charges on my debit card only for Wells Fargo to cancel my account without my consent. Leaving work early so I can get a temporary card, I found out upon arrival Wells Fargo were out of cards and going forward I will be charged $15/month for my account because I don't have a home mortgage tied to it (WTF?). Geez, can this day BE over already? My anticipation for dinner with my girls at Bar Crudo only turned into disappointment as we left $60 poorer, hungry, and offended by the service we received there.   F*CK IT. TIME TO DRINK.   Enter Fly Bar.   One friendly bartender.   One pitcher of sangria.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8MMhiZdt1QD4r8os_hKEvg?select=Up-H6Xf-i3ggdETtjh1dvw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/8MMh\u2026</a>  Several drunk texts later.   I was the cheery old Cherylynn AGAIN. *smiles* =D  And who says, alcohol doesn't cure misery?   LIES. ALL LIES.   OTHER NOTES: *Fast, efficient, and AWESOME staff *Diverse and easy going crowd *HH everyday from 3:30 PM - 6:30 PM ($3 sangria, $1 off beer/sake cocktails, $5.95 all pizzas) *MENU: apps, salads, sandwiches and pizzas (kitchen closes at 11 PM) *Old skool hip hop and rock music *Chic goth meets old roman decor *With just one unnoticeable TV above the doorway, go elsewhere on game nights  *One unisex restroom",

I don't dislike rap, but somehow it just felt out of place on this night.

I did, however, enjoy the plethora of beautiful and sexy women who were here, most of which in small pairs or groups, no men in sight. One extra star for the fact it was NOT a sausage fest.

Fly Bar is a fairly small place so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table during busy hours. Although this is the case, I think the wait is worth it. They have beer and sangria (YUM). I'm not sure about hard alcohol, though. The food is actually really good. I would recommend trying one of their many pizzas.

Fly Bar is still the place it was in the summer of '09 as it is now. Solid food (the hummus plate is surprisingly fantastic), great sangria, and never a dull moment at the pool table. As this part of town turns a new leaf, I'm so stoked to see it continuing to flourish.",

Our bus cruised down Divisadero and one of the student tour guides from USF informs us that to our right was Fly Bar and when we were older we would go there and spend a lot of time. She proved to be right. We loved getting dizzy off sangria and flirting with the boys that visited. It was a stop after (and before) shows at the Independent. Just a great neighborhood hangout!  I came by recently for a bit of nostalgia. Harkening back to the days when I was still escaping midterms or drowning in final papers. The faces were still familiar. Our server was a bit batty ... just as I had left her. I must admit until my most recent visit I had no idea there was food here. But the half price pizza happy hour is great. A good place to chow down on a rustic California pie.  I really like places where you don't have to put on a front. There's no agenda at Fly Bar. Be who you are and come in for a beer. You'll be glad you did.",

And, if it does, then, more room for me at this great neighborhood bar. The salads there are so good, you have to try the El Tortilla or the Espinacha Caliente, and pair with it the Shroom Pie. Magnifico! The portions are huge, so it's fgood to share. \u00a0Many people go to Fly for the Nachos-so if you are into that-then definitely dive in (yummi). The music they play is always great, and the staff there is always so nice. And, they serve Chimay, and only the coolest bars serve Chimay. So, if you want to be part of the NOPA crowd, this is a must check out. smile.",

Walking into dark Fly Bar, I stepped back to let my friends head to the bar first. Unbeknown to me, the entrance has a slight ramp with a small ledge on the sides. As I stepped back, I ended up tripping over the ledge, flying through the air and landing square on some unlucky guy's table, hurtling his beer through the air. The glass broke into a million pieces and I felt everyone's eyes on me sprawled over the table in my Ohio State sweatshirt.  I literally could hear the crickets.   Props to this bar for not kicking me out after wreaking havoc on their establishment. I ended up grabbing a cold beer and mourning my team by the window with my friends. The atmosphere of this place is great and I'll definitely return- hopefully this time without the embarrassing spill.",

I know they tried to fancy it up by removing the chalk board and stuff, but now with all the crazy shaped mirrors and bright concrete bar I kinda feel like I should light some incense and wear my sarong. Besides that though, I do like the crowd that comes into the Fly. The bartenders are also very, very nice people and pretty attentive when you need a refill--even when it's crowded. The Fly also has a great happy hour deal on their pizzas at four bucks a pop until 6:30. I can't tell you how many times this has saved me when I've been dirt poor or trying to entertain out of town friends on a budget.   I often find myself wandering into the Fly as my last stop of the evening, which can sometimes be absolutely dangerous! Just a week ago, after a night of bar hopping to 4 different bars all over the city, my friend texted me to meet him there for a drink. I was already buzzed so I was only planning on having one and going home but noooooo, that did not happen. After the bar closed, I had the bright idea of running to the liquor store, getting some tall boys and drinking them in alamo square park until the butt crack of dawn. And the next morning???? Or should I say afternoon, I felt like death was coming to get me. But that's why I love the Fly. at my old age, it's rare I do that kind of thing anymore, but that sangria has something in it to keep me going!",

It's had its ups &amp; downs over the years, sure - for a while I didn't go there much because the clientele seemed to all be under 25, white, and suburbanites-turned-SF'ers. Lately though it's back to the usual neighborhood eclecticism; you'll see a few older folks, a bunch of 30 or 40 somethings, some younguns (mostly well behaved.)  Things I like about Fly:  ~ \u00a01/2 price pizzas for happy hour? Get outta here! (No, really - it's true!) ~ very friendly &amp; professional servers/bartenders for the most part ~ not a hipster joint ~ mostly family-friendly - meaning you can have some food &amp; beers with your kids in tow and not feel like a bad parent.  Things I'd like to see change:  ~ enforcement of the \"no smoking within two feet of the door\" rule ~ happy hour extended a half hour to an hour ~ stop showing sports on the TV; the only people that watch are loud local drunkards who then let the game's outcome turn them into either manic assholes or depressed assholes  All in all, if you're not an effete trendoid that needs retarded house music or hard liquor to have a good time, this is a great spot.

I walked into Fly at 2:30 today for a pre-Superbowl beer and a pizza. There were roughly 20 people in the establishment and not a single person was talking. I'm not joking - I thought I walked into a library. At least 4 people were reading books. I almost walked out on principle.   Aside from the pizzas, I really don't like anything about this place. The strange, ubiquitous chubby children artwork creeps me out. The black ceiling and deep purple walls with long velvet curtains make me feel as if I'm trapped in some bizarre Goth dungeon. I want to be happy when I eat and socialize. I'd rather not dine in places where the interior designer cultivated the 'slit your wrists' aura.   That said, the pizzas really are remarkable (minus The Southwestern - bland and no avocado, what a joke). The Pesto pizza is unreal. The Blue Caramel rocks as well. The half price pizza happy hour special (which exists on the weekend as well) is stellar. Yes, I just said 'stellar.' Deal with it.",

Only the cheaper set of pizzas are available for $6 which is still good and they don't have house drinks on special, but at least they have Sangria's for $3 which is worth getting excited over.   The service was quick and good and food still a good size. As a girl the pizza can be easily shared between two, but I know my guy friends have no problem finishing the whole pizza on their own. The decor/ambiance was okay though.",

Mostly neighborhood folk. When I was looking for parking I remembered why I hate this neighborhood so much. Mildly ghetto and no parking. The parking gods were upon me this evening though as I got a spot across the street and in less that 15 minutes. They have redone the artwork here and it looks nice. The bartender was cool and the food is always good. Too bad they don't have a sign that says, \"No euro-trash allowed.\" One of them got lost and tried to molest me at the bar. I think I still might throw up from the trauma.",

Anyway, I was too lazy to head in to the Castro and none of use felt like dealing with the Haight, so we decided to explore NOPA. \u00a0Fly Bar was the second of three stops, and overall, easily our favorite. \u00a0 The interior decor is pleasant and semi-romantic, but also hip, and the bartender was very attentive and wore a very short jean skirt. \u00a0And yes, the bartender was a girl, much to Nick's dismay. \u00a0Although he likes handsome boys and is bored with fairies and queens. \u00a0 We all liked the beer selection, and while no food was sampled, it certainly looked and smelled good. \u00a0 The only problem is there was no booze, and after looking at the sad look on my friend's face, I agreed to hit the Castro with him. \u00a0Being the complete asshole that he is, he took me to Moby Dick. \u00a0 Thankfully, I had already relieved my bladder at Fly Bar.  So there you have it, approval from a straight guy, a straight girl, and a guy that was married to a woman for 5 years, but turned out to be Gay. \u00a0Nice showing, Fly Bar. \u00a0I'll be back.",

The music is always great here and a different genre every time I go in. \u00a0Last night was a lot of soul and funk, which suited my mood quite well as I tore into some Funky Chicken pizza (bbq, chicken, gouda, red onions, and scallions) and a side of Spinach &amp; Artichoke dip. \u00a0Mmm mmm, good. \u00a0I seriously can say that I've tried over half the menu and everything is mahvelously delicious. \u00a0I would also recommend the hummus plate, grilled cheese sandwich, and goat cheese &amp; chicken quesadilla. \u00a0Wash that down with a guinness if you have room left over...

Maybe it's the laid back atmosphere that let's you choose the bar-counter, a table to munch at, or sporadic small round tables for drinking and chatting with friends.

I truly think San Francisco has mastered the art of the \"restaurant-bar\" scene. Everywhere in the city there are places you can pop in for tapas style snacks, a full dinner, or a well mixed cocktail. The major plus in SF is you don't have to worry about grody bar food like fries and burgers, you can get great food and great drinks all in one place.   Fly bar was loud, the crowd was friendly and the Sangria ($20/large pitcher) was good!

This bar/restaurant is one of the friendliest and most accessible bars along Divisadero in the NOPA neighborhood. It's never too crowded and you can almost always get a table.   The best time to go, however, is during Happy Hour, which operates daily from 3:30-6:30 pm. Pizzas are offered at half price. I always get the Carmel Blue pizza, a perfect blend of Gorgonzola and Mozzarella cheese with caramelized onions on a light garlic and olive oil sauce. \u00a0I'm salivating as I think about it... For an extra bonus, I add prosciutto for an extra $1.... heaven.   I also highly recommend the la tortilla salad and the chicken &amp; goat cheese quesadilla. Really though, I have never ordered anything from the menu that I didn't love.  The atmosphere at Fly Bar is extremely relaxing. The bar acts as a gallery for local artists and it always switching up the artwork and installations hanging on the walls. I have yet to buy a piece, but I have my eye on a piece from the current installation of wax and watercolor art. Fabulous. There is also a pool table in the back of the bar, and people are always willing to team up or start a tournament.   I only have one problem with the bar, but it's a big enough problem to take one star down from the rating: there is no hard alcohol. Fly Bar only serves Beer (both draft and bottled), sake, and soku (a very sweet Japanese vodka) drinks. So, if you are looking for a vodka tonic or a jack and coke, this bar isn't for you.",

However, last night chillin' with my new friend, the music was too loud at Club Waziema and Madrone was charging a cover, so I suggested we head over to Fly, the neighborhood default. Of course being on that certain stretch of Divis, by default hard liquor was unavailable. We ordered the sangria, which is stroooong. Chatting under the favorable volume of Ella Fitzgerald and JT, sipping our drinks in a cozy booth below the dim lighting of the star lamps dotting the ceiling, I realized hey, this place is pretty cool. Sexy, even. I guess I just tend to forget because it's so close to home.  To kill time while your bladder explodes waiting in line for the one stall, unisex, toilet seat cover-less bathroom (minus a star), stare very closely at the artwork of the girl in the outhouse--tripped me out the first time I realized it was a painting, not a photograph! Or maybe I just don't have the eye for that kinda thing, though from now I certainly won't take the neighborhood default for granted. Fly is bringing sexy back... yeah!",

Well - I regret that decision.  I was headed to a show at the Independent this past weekend, and we ended up going to Fly beforehand to meet up with the bassist from the band (why are bassists always so effing hawt?), so he could stay nearby for soundcheck.  The outside of Fly is desceiving (and part of why I never went in). \u00a0The windows are dark, the sign looks like it was xeroxed and the paint seems a lil chipped. \u00a0Inside, though, the place is dive-y cute. \u00a0 Small tables, and a few large booths. \u00a0A pool table. \u00a0A bar. \u00a0And a kitchen hidden somewhere.  We had some beers, one of their soju-cocktails (saki-infused since they can't serve hard liquor) and few pitchers of sangria. \u00a0The sangria was delicious, and a half pitcher fills 4 sizeable glasses. \u00a0The soju-cocktail was alright - nothing all that exciting. \u00a0And I assume the beer was good. \u00a0Our server was a sweet lil lass, who was great about being there exactly when we needed her.  We didn't order food, but I saw several plates being delivered and I gotta say - that grub looked GOOD. \u00a0I wasn't hungry, but I was seriously considering eating anyway. \u00a0Yum-tastic.  After the show at the Independent, we'd had such a good time at Fly, we headed back, and spent a few more hours soaking up the atmosphere and sangria. \u00a0Unfortunately, they'd stopped serving food, but our sweet server-type told us we were welcome to bring food in from wherever we wanted (which we did). \u00a0There was no line for the pool table (which is always a plus), and we enjoye a riotous, if terribly amateur, game of pool.  So, yeah - good service, yummy looking food, delcious sangria, and a nice, laid-back vibe. \u00a0I dig it. \u00a0The only downside is the lack of hard liquor, but, uh - that did nothing to deter us from getting far more effed up than we'd intended...",

And while I enjoyed the artwork, the enormous menu over the bar listing all the hip/trendy martini and sangria drinks was a little overwhelming. Just give me a drink damn it! Don't make me choose from a list of 500 concoctions.  So here's why this place gets 2 stars. Scenario: Friend and I go up to the bar and start discussing the menu where we have 500 choices:  Me: What are you getting? Friend: I have no idea. You? Me: I don't know. I'll ask the bartender what his favorite is. If I can get his attention. Bartender? Oh Bartender?  (5 minutes later)  Me: Do you know what you're getting? Friend: I was thinking about the Ginger Cranberry Pineapple Grape Strawberry-infused Cherry Sangria. You? Me: I dunno, I was thinking about the Melon Mango Banana Watermelon Cranberry Martini.  (Still waiting for bartender to actually pay attention to customer)  (5 minutes later)  Me: Bartender? Oh Bartender?  (5 minutes later)  Me: EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So finally he came up and took our order. I didn't even bother asking him what he recommended because he seemed to involved in trying to act cool to even listen.   Yeah I'll probably go back some time. I guess one time being to a place can't really do it justice... And besides, the drink actually was pretty good. And I've got 499 more to try.",

The most \u00a0attractive thing about the Fly is the Happy Hour and the down to earth hostesses that work there. Also the sangria mmmmm! they used to have the red and the white sangria that was the shhhhh!!!  Yet if you cannot find a seat this place can go from 2 stars to no stars and feel pretty sickening. Just go for the happy hour early and you will enjoy yourself tremendously.  In addition: I went there recently and it seems like the prices have went up but the quality has gone way down.",

We ordered baked brie and a margherita pizza. Both items were fantastic.  I wasn't feeling the soju drinks much, so my waitress was kind enough to take it back and replace with wine. She was the best waitress I have had in like..years. Always making sure no one was standing in the door/aisle area..always making sure everyone had a place to sit, always there when I needed her.  Music ranged from indie to rap... something about 'Straight Outta Compton' being on and watching city folks walk against violent wind was super entertaining.

Maybe it's time again?  I constantly clown this place because of my history with it but it is unjustified in every way. They have great food at great prices and great cocktails and a great beer selection. It is a great happy hour spot. If I'm not mistaken the pizza (which are really good) are only $6 during happy hour. A total steal! The people are a mixed bag. You will see some true locals, some transplanted locals and a small but steady stream of Lower Pac Heights folks come on in.   The seating doesn't really lend itself towards group mingling and the seats are kind uncomfortable. It is however a great place to come with one or two friends to get some drinks. It's a good starting point to the evening but not a destination spot.  Come here. \u00a0You might find me here but most likely not. I am just building up the cojones to get back in there.

You can't go wrong with the reasonably priced-food (from the apps to the salads to the sammies). I am a cheesy gal, so one of my fav apps is the baked brie. It's served warm, and spreads so smoothly on the baguette. The garlic isn't overpowering either. Oh, and as a cheese lover, I heart the grilled cheese sammie. Hello, it's on sourdough, my most fav bread! Oh, and it's somewhat healthy since there's tomato! Ok, so if you want the real healthy stuff, go for the salads, with super fresh and crisp lettuce, and are ginormous! My fav is the fruit to nuts.

Unfortunately for me, I'm not and finding parking in this neighborhood isn't the easiest feat so this is a treat I can retreat to once in awhile. I kept hearing about sake bar this and awesome menu that so of course I had to come and check the place out.  I'm more of a foodie than a drunk so I ransacked the menu as soon as I got greeted and sat. Nachos and pineapple juice for me while I waited for my girlfriend and while I waited, I stared at the weird artwork on the wall. Don't get me wrong, there's a really beautiful painting behind the pool table but the smaller ones looked like someone's child did it. And if someone's child did do it, well then that just makes sense.  The nachos here are fantastic. And yes, nachos are bar food and everyone does bar food but these guys know how to pile on the cheese and make sure it gets baked in good between all the chips. I especially love a place that adds black beans to the mix since there was no chicken option. And shamefully, I ate the whole dish before my friend even got there. But thankfully, she doesn't read Yelp reviews and will never know of my private shame.   She did arrive (30 minutes later) and promptly dove into the Sake Breeze which consisted of sake, cranberry juice, and pineapple juice. I took a sip and if it weren't for the fact that I get a case of the \"asian red, \" I would have helped her out with it a little more. It was sweet, balanced and had just a subtle undertone of sake. Darn my \"asian red\"...  Together we ordered a margherita pizza and hummus plate while we critiqued the odd artwork on the walls and whether it could really be called \"artwork.\" Our hummus plate arrived shortly after the first round of drinks and it certainly did impress us both. The pita was warm and fluffy, the dip creamy and smooth. It was the perfect giant snack for the perfect drink. I can't comment on the margherita pizza however 'cause once the hummus plate was done, so was I.   Overall, the drinks were great, the food was better and our server Holly did everything she could to ensure we had a great time. This was months ago but I'll be back again for sure when I find myself in the neighborhood.",

No there isn't really a dance floor, but I do my best to push away the tables and chairs and take it over, beat up the beat, bust a groove, shake my a$$, break it down, and whatever else you'd like to call it. The best part is anticipating what the next song is gonna be and you are like \"Oh snap, I remember this from 1993!\". I LOVE IT and can't help but have a fantastic time with my peeps, all while sipping sangria and spilling it all over myself. \u00a0All the bartenders rock too. So make your way on over.

After coming here many times and only eating nachos, i decided to venture out into something a lil more cheaper, pizza... as these lil flavorful bites are great and also qualify for the happy hour prices.. so thats def a big plus.  the maritinis are also happy hour prices and are great to sip on with some pizza or antother item from their menu.  another plus about this place is happy hour is Mnonday thru sundays.. which is a big plus if you happen to drink on weekends like most of us do and want to save a lil bit of money b4 hitting the bars or clubs on weekend nites!  i would and have recommended this place to a few friends and from the ones that i have taken there, they all love it and would go bak for more.  also another note: for some reason.. the Fly on Divisdero tastes alot better than the new one that opened off of Sutter St.... although i dont want to bash it completely.. cuse it does have alot more room, and a small game room where you and some friends can get in a few rounds while downing some beers...",

This is probably my favorite of their salads. We also ordered the Blanco pizza - sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, red onions, scallions, and garlic sauce. Their pizzas are thin and crunchy and a great option for groups since they are the perfect size for sharing. Their bar is beer and wine only!

He responded with, \"you know what, um never mind...I'll have what she's having a...cab...\"  Apparently I had been there before just I had suspected. The place had been remodeled, the poor boy special was taken out and new paint was put on the walls. The place was looking good. Before we had even looked at the menu our waitress asked for our order. We asked for a minute to decide. We decided and then we talked about the place, the pool table, the art, the interesting people at the bar, the interesting people in our lives, interesting people in general but we hadn't talked about the food yet as the minute we asked for extended for quite some time. Our waitress may have forgotten about us. Or possibly was ignoring the person I was with for offending her by ordering something she had never heard of. I'll blame him because she was noticebly nicer to me. Finally we asked another server working if we could put an order in which she sweetly responded, \"yeah, no problem...sorry she's been busy today\"   We ordered the Chicken and goat cheese quesadilla and Thai Basil Chicken Pizzeta and the food was delicious and at the end of the night I was a happy girl.  I would definitely go here again. Although our waitress was absent minded (even when we would try to engage in conversation or make her laugh it seemed to go right over her head) the food and atmosphere made up for it.   I hope when I do go to Fly for dinner again (which I will) that I get the same server I'd like to believe she just had a bad day, or not.",

To my surprise, the waitress brought over a glass that looks nothing like a snakebite so I said...  M: I'm sorry but this isn't the snakebite I ordered. W: Yes it is, Stella with Cider. M: Really?? I always thought it was Guinness and Cider. W: Yeah, that's what I thought too but someone told me this was it. Try it, if you don't like it, I'll change it.  And I did like it! I learned something new! Wow! Sh said the Guinness and Cider was called Black Velvet. I don't know if she's correct or not but if somebody knows, let me know so I know for the future.  For food we ordered a variety of 1/2 priced pizza including Blanco, The Funky Chicken, and Mmm...Meat. All good but nothing special with the mm..meat. The blanco was my favorite. Maybe because I'm a sucker for sun-dried tomatoes.  The table next to us order the spinach and artichoke dip and it looked SOO good we had to get that too. They even serve it hot! Great!

Some of my friends and I headed over to join around 8PM and the place was starting to fill in. We said our hellos at the pool table and snagged a spot for two at the bar. My friend bartends there so she came over quickly to say hello and took our order of Chicken Nachos with extra jalape\u00f1os. The food took a while to come out, so we worked on our beers and chatted.   The Nachos were seriously bomb. SO MANY EXTRA jalape\u00f1os! I was amazed, but I also did a little schmoozing at the kitchen window while I waited for the bathroom, speaking in broken Spanglish to the chef to please add mas mas! Everything was hot, both temp wise and spiciness, and extremely cheesy so we were very happy. We also got a cup of sour cream, guac, and Pico de Gallo on the side.

Annoying patrons, crappy beer/wine list, bad neighborhood, ugly bartender...you name it. Yet Fly has surpassed even this critic's sharpest eye and come out on top. Bravo, Fly, you've topped my list. 'Why?' you ask?  For one, they serve Poppy Jasper. For those of you not in the know, this is hands down the tastiest microbrew around, yet can only be found at a few establishments (Zeitgeist for one) in town. This was the original reason I kept coming back time and again...that, and the fact it's two blocks from my house. But I digress. Poppy Jasper accounts for at least ONE of these stars.  Then there's the menu. I've yet to order anything I don't like (and at this point, I've pretty much made it through the whole menu). The Black Forest Ham and Brie sandwich is a delight, as are these \"salads on top of pizzas\" whatever-they-call-'ems. YUM. That's star TWO.  Decor adds the third star; I believe this is owned by the same people that own Solstice and Brick, yet any and all possible pretension is removed leaving behind a cozy, neighborhood feel. The series of paintings hung high on the wall are unique and eye-catching, and the hanging paper lanterns over the pool table (always in use, but somehow unobtrusive) create a warm, inviting light to the venue.   At this point you'd start looking for flaws and might turn to the service to find one, except this is NOT the case. The bartenders are prompt, attentive and friendly despite usually being slammed, and the servers demonstrate the same attention to their customers. Even on nights when there's a waiting list for seating, they are patient and kind and when you DO get seated, will make sure that you always have a full beer and aren't lacking for grub. The fourth star is well-deserved for this.  As for star five, I'll admit it: it's the location. One block down from The Independent (and two from my house), it's many a night when I walk in and see friends among the many patrons at Fly. In fact, it's become our local watering hole, mainly for the reasons listed above but also for that genuine feel of camaraderie and the fact that, after a long night and a full tummy, we can stumble home easily without incident. While \"Cheers\" is a fictional concept, it's not too far off from the affection that I feel for this locale. Everybody may not know my name, but the staff sure knows my face...I come here weekly, for good reason.",

I love plans!  We shared a little tequila, had a vent session about our week and then headed out praying for good cab karma.... It was nearing 10pm and prime cab-fighting hour. We braced ourselves for war. Nope, we got one right away and sped off into the night to Fly bar. I had never been to this bar before, so carefully I started crafting my yelp review on the way over. Haha \u00a0sadly not kidding about this.  We walked in and it all just hits you at once... \u00a0the stunning colorful murals, the soft lighting and the great crowd. Like a trifecta of visual euphoria. it was insanely crowded but we maneuvered through to find natalies friends waiting for us with beer. Hmm.... 5 ridiculously good looking guys waiting for us with beer? Oh my pretty friend Natalie, this is why I love thee so.  Our group had a great time here.... The only negatives were: trying to order a drink up at the bar was like trying to locate a living, breathing republican in san francisco. Next to impossible. Or that this completely drunk 6 foot amazon chick towering behind me kept elbowing me in the back the entire time with her giantess monster pointy elbows. \u00a0  Finally one of the guys in our group insisted we head over to O'keeffes next... \u00a0I was not going to argue about this, because as much as I loved fly bar, the crowd was getting a little sweaty and crazy.   Final thoughts are, i will surely come back.... but maybe on a week night instead, when the cool kids come out to play, because Fly is definitely supa-fly in my book.   *insert sizzling sound here*",

The bar itself is pretty cool, decent sized with decent food, but nothing that really sets it apart from other establishments. I'm rating it 2 stars because I left my card there. When I awoke the next day and realized it was missing, I knew it had to be at Fly Bar. I called them and talked to Katie who \"looked\" for it, but alas she could not find it. I called 2 other places I went to that night with no luck. I then called back Fly Bar and asked them to look for my card again and again Katie said it wasn't there. I'm from Boston so obviously being on the other side of the country without access to my bank account is troublesome. After half of my day was consumed with trying to find my card, and even though I spoke with Katie twice and she assured me my card wasn't there, I decided to go there in person and ask for it. So I walk in and go to the bar and ask them if they have my card. I give my name to the bartender and she goes into the back room and walks out 2 seconds later with my card in hand. So Katie, thank you so much for ruining half of my day because you were too lazy/incompetent to actually check for my card.",

The first time I went to Fly Bar was on Halloween night. Like most bars, it was crowded and hot, but what set it apart was how friendly both the employees and other customers were.  I was definitely Justin Bieber for Halloween, and when I accidentally mentioned to the young man behind me in the bathroom line that he also looked like J.Biebz I was greeted with a jovial, \"I have no idea who that is, but thank you!\"  Needless to say, I was stoked to be in such pleasant company.  I would recommend getting insanely happy off Fly Bar's homemade Sangria (served out of a punch bowl). This stuff is GOOD. Have you ever had Sangria that tastes like Hawaiian Punch and nail polish remover? I have. And I've lived with that unfortunate taste for months.  Luckily, Fly Bar has perfected the art of drinkable Sangria. I don't know what wine they use, but it has an awesomely smooth finish, soft tannins, and a lingering vanilla flavor. Get on that.  Fly Bar also offers a long list of sake cocktails (including an orange creamsicle option), which I obnoxiously referred to as socktails all night. \u00a0And as I said above, their beer selection is also incredible, so take a load off and enjoy your soft stuff. Hard liquor is for alcoholics anyway.",

Shot out to the waitress @ Fly Bar!  The pizza's amazing. It's all flat crust and real crunchy, just how I like it. The sangria, beer, and cocktails were amazing.   Pros: Great menu during happy hour, pool table, tv's to watch from, and cool decor all over, and even on the ceilings.

The bar section was very good - I had an IPA of some sort. They had a pretty decent beer selection on tap.  When we finally sat down, I ordered the grilled cheese. Not quite sure why I ordered the grilled cheese, except that I felt like it. Sometimes you feel like a grilled cheese. This wasn't exactly what I had expected. When I order a grilled cheese. I expect a lot of cheese. This one came with a lot of lettuce (ostensibly a side salad) and not much cheese. The bread was crispy (I like my grilled cheese soft), and it had tomatoes on it. Overall, not bad for a sandwich, but really not my definition of grilled cheese. I would probably order something different next time.  My friend ordered the Cobb Salad with some additions. He seemed pretty happy with his food.  My friends each went to the bathroom during the meal, and were gone for quite some time. I take it that the line was pretty long.  The service was pretty good, and the decor was neat (there are some pictures). I would definitely come back here to drink, although I'm not quite sure about the food.

The interior is dark and feels like a padded cell. There is a revolving art show on the walls of local artists. There is one pool table cramped in the back. There is a good selection of beers on tap although to see PBR was a shock. The food is larger portions and I would classify it as neveau pub fare.  I had the meatloaf sandwich this last time. It was called the \"Ain't Yo Mama's Meatloaf Sandwich\" and for good reason. This was actually better than your mama's meatloaf. Well, my mama's meatloaf at least. I don't know what your mama's meatloaf tastes like. And much love to my mama but this meatloaf was better.  I've had the nachos before and other pizzas like the Marguerite. Everything is generously proportioned and fairly priced. Fly doesn't have a hard liqueur license so all the drinks are mixed with sake or soju.  Now here's the kicker. I work for the Solstice/Fly/Brick empire and although I rarely go into Fly I still got great service... at 6:00PM. The price was right too (wink, wink).  ***Update Feb 9 2008; Over the Christmas break Fly got a little face lift. It's a little roomier with a newly designed bar. New beers include Anderson Valley's Brother David's Double and Speakeasy's Hunter's Point Porter. I ate the Foghorn Leghorn sandwich and it was suggested to me that next time I get it on ciabatta with a side of bbq sauce.",

Interesting....but not really my thing...so, had to stick to beer...no Newcastle! Bummer. But, it's ok.   Food, was excellent! I really, really, liked my pizza. It was excellent.   Service-Not the best I ever had, I don't like having to stare down a waitress to get some service. And it wasn't even that busy at the time, she was just standing over by the bar talking to the other waitress. Damnit! I'm hungry and have a show to go to! Let's get some hustle on this shit!   Ambiance- was ok I suppose, some of the other people hanging out there were questionable...but hey, who am I to cast the first stone and shit. Overall, I think I'd go back to that Ethiopian place before a show at the independent...",

It looked like Lindsay Lohan had been wrestling Bruce Willis in here, the furniture was all in disarray and the staff were all sort of out of it and sweaty. \u00a0Not that I give a crap where the furniture is, but it was all just sorta disheveled and crappy and poor service and did not meet my social needs.",

I liked the lighting and art, very mellow with some Lil' Wayne bumping in the background. We started off with $3 sangrias and ordered the Mmm...Meat pizza ($5.95). Be sure to order a pizza asap because it takes about 20-30 minutes to come out since the guy is making it from scratch. We had sake with pear juice (yum!) next then the Poppy Jasper Amber Ale (tasted like Anchor Steam!). I will be back again for happy hour!",

We went about 8pm, so the crowd was still pretty mixed with drinkers and eaters and drinkers/eaters. I had what was basically a cobb salad called something else and I really liked it.. the salad was fresh greens, and came with chicken-- that, with my stella draft, I was set. Pretty cheap, fun dark loungy atmosphere, no annoying people to complain about and an overall good night at a place I need to get back to.",
