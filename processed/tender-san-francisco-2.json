Like its neighbor, the space is small and cozy, but on a Thursday night, the bar was just-full enough to be lively, but not \u00a0crowded.  The service was great-- while waiting, one bartender grabbed the Huxley menu next door for us, allowing us to preview our dining selections. The other bartender, who took care of our (mostly heavy) pours. She was friendly, a bit sassy (which I love) and accommodating.   They have an upstairs loft area, which was empty for most of the time, but would make a great space for a larger group. Tender definitely merits another visit!",

One always hopes when you head to the city that the long drive will be worth it and it really was! \u00a0We were greeted by a very friendly (and not hard to look at) bar tender upon entering and our every need was anticipated all evening. \u00a0There is so much to try that we can't wait to go back. \u00a0  The cheese board was phenomenal and buckets of bread coupled with alternating beers and glasses of wine... what a great time! \u00a0Tender is cozy with a great atmosphere, the art and lighting makers for a perfect intimate evening with friends. And when the check came, thankfully we were not shocked as we often are when dining in the city. \u00a0  Thank you Tender for a wonderful kick off to my holiday season! 5 STARS!!!",

As others noted here, not particularly warm or welcoming (but not horrible), and the knowledge of the wine is a little lacking. I think these are things that will improve.   BTW, to the staff, that was in fact a Sav Blanc that you served my wife, not a Chardonnay. Trust me, I know the difference; 20+ years of experience and several hard-earned sommelier certifications to prove it. Your taps were clearly switched (it's really not that uncommon). While I appreciate that you changed the glass out for an actual Chardonnay, the (two) unnecessary and somewhat condescending comments after the fact were just annoying. Please don't be condescending to your polite, appreciative, and likely-to-be-regular customers.  And just one more gripe: Do you really need to have a locking bathroom that requires a code?",
